A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leadership forces justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, of the Brennan Center for the latter is a myth, confirmed that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The law, lawyers, the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: the new rules will negatively affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures are part of the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US federal states are responsible for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, announced new laws, the procedures for the registration and the ballot box.
This phenomenon has grown in importance after the elections in November 2010, in which the new Republican leaders in 26 states.
As a result, 180 law drafts were introduced in 2011, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present a photo ID and proof of the US State of citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shortens the time periods for the early vote, the right to void the election day to register as voters, and State denied citizens the right to vote, for which a court file.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state has asked voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first federal state, which has made such a request.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed that the constitutional law of Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend the practice to other countries.
Over the last two years, fostered in 34 states, federal law drafts, which forced the voters to produce a photo ID.
It is important to note that the US citizens, in contrast to Quebec do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, 21 million voters people no photo ID card issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, often pay more than a hundred dollars to get the required identification.
The new restrictions are disproportionately affected low-income young people, minorities and people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those with an income of less than $35000, 18% of people over 65 years, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters increasingly cast their vote for Democratic candidates, it is not allowed in several states to use their from their establishment issued photo ID.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting, more for the Republican side of the cards issued by these clubs to use for elections.
Before 2004, a federal state, has called for dialing a proof of the State of citizenship.
Arizona was the first federal state, introduced such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their US state citizenship.
These measures clearly are intended to limit the Hispanic votes.
It is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted in 2011 in eight federal states laws with the registration of voters on election day.
In addition, you have the right of individuals and groups, those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
Example of the campaigns to register voters in the general election in 2004 helped to register some 10 million state citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009, the proportion of the registration of Neuwählern 2010 decreased by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have passed laws in five other federal states, which aim to shorten the period for early voting.
Examples were in the general election in Florida in 2008, 33% of voters who voted in advance, African-Americans, even though they make up only 13% of the voters of the federal state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the White, 76% of voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several drafts law were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage.
Example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the submission of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012 will no doubt complicate the exercise of the right to vote.
Democratic critics point to the partisan nature of the laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the crucial states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those states that have adopted such laws, 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that the legal provisions of these changes to the electoral system have a significant impact on the outcome of presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the turnout.
In this sense, these measures are part of the democratic system of the United States.

Prostate cancer early identification: the test should be done or not?
The PSA-wise, in fact, sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical procedures.
This leads to a greater reluctance of men already undecided for the implementation of screening tests.
The test should be done or not?
We have sought the opinion of two doctors.
The studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years of age, the likelihood of the formation of metastases by 30-40% higher when no screening was carried out.
I therefore recommend that the test from the age of 50 years or 40 years ago, when one has a direct relatives, which was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in men, Afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer was identified.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others, the indolent.
The patient really needs to be made to understand the extent of the risk of their cancer, giving him the possible options, which if left untreated prostate cancer types, if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, which has cancer detected no treatment because their cancer is aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are proposing an active surveillance and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
Certainly with increasing accuracy, the criteria for deciding who should be dealt with and who is not.
I therefore recommend that the implementation of the tests.
The most important thing is to talk with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.
This document (currently only available in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/-health/Tate prostate-cancer screening
Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy life, the best way to reduce the risk of him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone would eat well and get enough.
"If there would be no more smoking, would increase the value of at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of all cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction is a priority, despite the drop in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several types of cancer.
It harms the health of the people.
"Today there are still regrets in Quebec, 1.5 million smokers," the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society also overweight and obesity, the outbreak of the disease.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, colon, rectal examination, feeding tubes, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity throughout life against colon cancer," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In them, it increases the risk of a Grimm or fattening colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin additives and cancer.
Their studies are not conclusive.
The Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While the study found to reduce the risk of prostate cancer showed another increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer has also not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to talk about his concerns and his family Vorbelastung with his doctor.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."

The Higgs Boson analyzed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs-Bosons has attracted some attention last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that the Boson is nothing less than the mechanism, which is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model - our best or the least wrong " explanation of the nature and behavior of matter whose existence - but not empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs Boson is very similar.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data were presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data yet to be completely secure.
We assume that it is indeed the Higgs is deceiving, because apparently only a low risk, and let us look at what is at stake.
In this world, there is an inevitable standard law meant that two objects can be both at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule, and try not to, because you are hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really weird world, it turns out that such a law applies to them: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same quantum state ", a " condition " on the whole, consists of some of its properties.
The physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are good citizens, who are known as fermions and suddenly obey the Pauli principles.
And in the other, the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, whom nothing is sacred, not in any case, this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, at the same place.
These bosons are divided according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley lab (which, incidentally, is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the meso, we will not deal with the "force particles", the great forces of nature, and which would be the Higgs Boson, somehow.
However, it must be stressed that these bosons are not all so exotic creatures, such as one might think.
If you are able to read this history, it is only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: the photon, or light particles, " this is the " messenger " of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge faster or change the direction of the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" at this place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbing" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared and ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "bearers of the force."
More stable field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs field, "disrupted" must be the Boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen can reach very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, with a surface that could be a very large rocks spall.
That is why a giant particle accelerator is needed - as CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve the kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
It is not, in fact, all the particles and not all of the materials, which interact with the magnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - example of a sheet of paper would never think of themselves in the refrigerator.
And not all of the particles, the Higgs field: those who do interact, have a mass, while the others (such as the photon) have no mass.
What all this research can be "good", asks Ms Plamondon?
The review of the Standard Model (SM) for science, and they also enable physicists to examine all the discrepancies between the observations and predictions of SM.
There are many physicists hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference to open a door to a "new physics" and there might be some holes of the model.
It must be said that the latter is still flawed, as it offers no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, about 80% of the matter of the universe (re-ups!).
However, CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The impact of this research for the general population is difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the bell-labs would not suspect that their work such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (1962, were the first pulsed) has already said - that the laser was seen more as a "laboratory gimmick" in the beginning.
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all the instruments, surrounded by the research.
Example has developed, in turn, Willard Boyle in 1969, during his work in optics, a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of the sensor is now all digital cameras worldwide as the "eye" and has earned him the Nobel Prize for physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you can never really know....

Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
With its Committee on "die with dignity," Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of the end of life.
The debate has resumed in the near future, although a law draft is being prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look more closely at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone at his home in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer he inherited, he had a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years," he said, half-hearted in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, in which he arrived the previous day.
"However, it is always a shock, it is not possible to be prepared," he says.
The disease does its job: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even to eat.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned, agrees to help with the meal.
Boldly, he even to smile and speak with strangers who are around him give him his medication, and a bathroom.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that it heals my diarrhoea, as this is humiliating," he agrees.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this malady.
"In the course of our lives, we learned that a man standing shower," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the home of Victor-Gadbois.
In return, the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain people.
"It depends on the ability of the person," take a step back, he says.
Because in the eyes of several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they will be swamped by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing".
For Mrs A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die, "and by suffocation."
But the illness, I have my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no wishes more in life," she says, before she accepts that she wears a mask that helps her breathe.
They are expected in the next few days, despite a recent visit to her son, who is from Italy.
The Victor home Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance with food absorption.
The palliative care is used if there are no other options.
The death.
In Quebec to 11700 inhabitants of a bed for palliative care.
This is very little when you consider that one day we will all die.
Here, life will be continued in the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying wishes a mouth care with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Last night Mr X, we have a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son drink beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
The Victor home Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93, the last family gathering in the courtyard, and is supported by his pillow while hitting his honor, dies, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, tragically, he has tried to do everything in order to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients at the age of less than 45 years," Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of patients admitted to the home of Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care to a care to relieve the suffering of patients, though the latter have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations such as the home of Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
This very serious shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several doctors specializing in palliative care, look forward to the adoption of a law to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, which has been signed by prominent figures of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express its opposition to any such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system is not capable of Quebec's performance enough to ensure that all of the right to have a high-quality palliative care before it is accepted on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room without has taken measures to alleviate.
I am afraid that the patients are dying simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions hard until the last day.
The survival chances of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologists that I will stop the treatment, she replied that they regret giving up the fight, told them.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, to thank the medical staff that it is not granted this request, after the pain of a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that the palliative care in pain treatment is not omnipotent.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of the palliative care society of domestic palliative care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients do not speak of a pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often rely on terminale sedation, the patients either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death einzuschläfern.
We can no longer pretend that this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief are increasingly resorting to these terminale sedation.
Patients whose pain is not all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I want my pain."
The realization of this report was possible because of a journalism scholarship Canadian Health Research Institute.

Real estate scandal of great proportions in Quebec
Officials of the road, companies in the Bauhaupt industry money procurers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia every day to tell what they know about a great "system" are involved in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
"Industry", which was very expensive for the taxpayers of Quebec, particularly in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system is falling apart, since it has taken drastic measures," joked Jacques Duchesneau, an MEP in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was uncovered by a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the Treaties on road work in Quebec had reluctantly agreed to the then Prime Minister.
"Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he emphasized, "the transport ministry to save a billion dollars in the treaties," some tame their instinct to get their share.
" The Charbonneau Commission already has two mayors, he adds, " in the hope that she will demonstrate the tactics behind the individuals. "
A 2011 launched permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 launch, ongoing anti-corruption unit with its troops in economic, auditors and analysts find the government is also a great deal of effort.
"The policemen" Marteau force, which since 2009 has ensured that the "sewer cartel" by Montreal in the artificial inflation of the Treaties restrained...
In the last few weeks, it has carried out series of house searches and allegations of fraud and corruption against local mandate carriers such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list, Gilles Vaillancourt, who is from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third-largest city.
He is suspected in exchange for public contracts repeatedly bribes.
Specifically, moreover, were accused of engineers of road construction office of Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a stir by saying that the Commission has the function of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He has several years of 3% of the value of the contracts in Montreal to the agents in connection with the Mafia, which paid the money to the Union Montreal party mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has had his hand in the game in the 2000s, more than 88000 Canadian dollars (68000 euros) province of parties, especially the Liberal, formerly in power at that time.
He also confessed to illegal fundraising for the former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, whose costs have been artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described in detail the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from contractors, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice-hockey games, as well as bribes to the tune of $736000 in return for sewer contracts, of which he is artificially inflated costs.
Other officials of road construction office have admitted that they could lubricate by artificially inflating invoices with false services by 30-40%.
Furthermore, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, its coffers filled with black money.
As a result of these revelations is Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, Montreal, plunged into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
As mayor of the municipality Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, they rebelled against from 2010, the sale of parish property that was purchased for $5 million and 1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns
The investigation will be carried out in the end, she says that she prefers "by a thread, which makes it possible to understand the way the system of ants are infiltrating in order to stop the evil and the guilty."
She says that the procedure was "painful, but positive."
We are going to clean the wound, however, need for Montreal only certain investigative unit, and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to clean.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Duchesneau turn notes that "several hundred officials have stolen millions of dollars," but above all concerned about the role of the "mandate, who are on the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
On the basis of a 70% of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quipped: "I was told that this is a poor substitute of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to him, nothing would change the situation, "as long as the election campaign spending will not be strictly limited, black money is circulating in the policy."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for public contracts and the financing of political parties, "we cannot fall deeper; the things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story is the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, demands, damages, Mr Duchesneau those who laugh about to take a look in their own backyard....

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
There are great players.
Every day I am on their side of progress.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements gives me every day to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I break in enthusiasm.
I have always been gradual progress since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my game time at Saint-Etienne.
Thus, the competition from Carlo Ancelotti introduced advantage...
The new additions this summer are used to a very high level.
They also know that each training unit.
This means that a player like me to stand up and do the best.
Incidentally, it gives me Carlo Ancelotti a lot in terms of my game.
He is supported by co-coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instills respect all technicians.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no other person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I had just recovered from a series of injury.
The trust he has placed in me, as well as an explanation for my services.
What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the frontrunner.
But lurking in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League, we have qualified for the final.
What is the objective of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have a very good European teams our input.
First of all, we want to be first in our group of Porto, so that we can fight for the return leg of the Achtelfinales as a home game.
The PSG in the short term a major European club?
He has already had its budget...
In order to become a major European club must win the Paris title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG resources so that this project taking shape.
It would be a major failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important to us, the cream of this title.
We were close last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to get the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be champion with 79 points....
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are vying for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media too much from the PSG?
In the light of what has been invested, and the players we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We accept that.
However, if we are in a home match against Troyes win 4-0, and you still find something you can accuse us, that is definitely a little frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We never could win every weekend with a 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a game plan.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League, we have shown strength.
Look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, fails to qualify for the final, and also has huge expenditures.
In relation to the sums invested was believed to break with 15 points ahead!
This would mean that our opponents and the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season of the new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May, the smiling victors and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
The PSG appears to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
The better that people speak of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic performance is strong and many goals.
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This inspires others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, one of the world's best defenders, allowing everyone to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
It was keen to take part in this.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me some playing time.
I saw things I am stronger.
Today, I will be able to achieve good games in the national team.
This was my baptism with the ' Bleus ' my hope.
What has happened in Ukraine, we learned our lesson and now we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the group qualification for the World Cup.
The national coach is strictly, the players and stimulates the victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not.
Blanc had reached his goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps ' Bleus ' will lead to Brazil.
The forced draw on 16 October in Spain (1: 1) an opening match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has worked for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.

The opposite of the current monetary exchanges on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies available, a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (in dollars, euros, etc.) as well as convertible, a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15000 computers in the network have already been collected about 200000 transactions.
Several thousand webpages accept Bitcoin as a donation, or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin had reached a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, he fell five months later, at 2 dollars before he recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade of real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October showed interest in virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as a "virtual currency" with the greatest success, "in competition with the dollar or the euro," and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other kinds of virtual currencies such as the credits, which are used to make progress in a video game by winning games or buy (and sometimes back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, the trade is controlled by a central authority.
With Bitcoin are all at the same time, the network nodes repositories of the accounting books, auditors, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each Trans action takes place between two users in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address, which ensures the anonymity.
A number of the action with the Trans-related data electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the Trans Action.
It is also possible to use the contents of the file to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the accounting book in the entire network of public accounts are available.
The crucial step is to enter this new Trans action in this book.
This is a mathematical task, which will be launched on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computer, "" the new Trans Action and add a number before the whole thing is "chopped."
The goal is to find the number, which is a special fingerprint (many leading zeroes).
If this number was found in the other nodes can check whether it is the right one.
The Trans Action is permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user for cheating could ever twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would pay for only one of the two transactions will be validated by the network and the other is a link, because they both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
In Bitcoins are limited to 21 million, but up to one hundred millionth divisible, which leaves some room for manoeuvre....
Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement in the computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The website, the services of Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness is not the Minutes," assuring Pierre Noizat, who has just Paymium introduced, this is a company to pay with real money, and the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering using anonymous service.
But also cash in these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations this article
They will be accepted by others, such as the blogging platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the book analyzes accounting and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are in circulation.
In November, was a "mega-final sale."
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coin Abul, Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a Trans Action Network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions are cheaper.
In addition, the owner's identity and can remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at dealerships, and the latter must install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply have to provide an address by telephone "and" can be detected, Pierre Noizat, assured that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in the hierarchical systems for more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report to re-evaluate the various risks today as a highly respected in the event of a success of this currency.

We are removed from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi) leave their area of responsibility.
NATO and the United States, followed by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we have punished the Afghan farmers, they are considered terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed and injured and people.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders fled to Pakistan, but also often from farmers who refuse to an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be available when the Western countries to be more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I watched from a hill of almond trees, which was financed with the help of French loans, according to regulatory.
The helicopters flew over trucks and tank convoys have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no Einströmen more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
Kabul was empty and covered the country due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war.
Their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the Organisation of Al-Qaeda overwhelmed farmers, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They have turned into this racket by land seized by the government to sell it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and thus benefit from the massive American contracting.
They have been discredited, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in campaigns, people want a government, not thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those that American contributions to capitalise on the flight of capital.
The young people have had enough of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran and Pakistan have had contact with the modern world, and the benefits they have enjoyed.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of boys and girls.
These young people who want to return to the obscurantism of parties to the corruption of some executive powers, they will have jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones, television, with its Turkish series, which is a modern world, anywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities, under whose command violence it will be seen as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle is already trying to restore the militia in the province of the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the example of the Western nations, but the abolition of the office of the prime minister, since the 1964 constitution of the United States wanted to make him a centralised state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign inspections, especially at the time of the elections, scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s, and already long dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional congestion are not viable and important irrigation system has not been repaired.
Everything is imported, apart from fruit and vegetables are produced.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country that has been devastated by 30 years of war, a state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was that Afghanistan has immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only there to seize.
Without energy to process iron or Kupfererz locally or mining is not possible without the means of transport for export through the mountains.
The Chinese have left the copper mine of Mes Aynak almost international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the huge Buddhist site their excavations and the major employers in the province.
One day it will be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys in high schools, Institute for French universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, the support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, has a service "civilian-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), the 2012 has been carried out in dozens of mountain villages, many charitable works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the "hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works were required for many local labor forces, can help to suppress the uprising, irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and improvement of agricultural land.
Which souvenirs after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions that are very hard in these often at a height of more than 2000 meters distant valleys.
In the message to dozens of written questions are small agricultural projects of municipalities of the province of Kapisa.
The farmers of the revolt, led by foreign groups, what is their desire for their own statements, the continuation of small, well-controlled and directly affect civilian aid to their benefit.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which he temporarily divided the unlimited power of attorney granted more than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the constitutional assembly to approve its final version, the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of the State House was granted two extra months to the end of his work.
Egypt is based now for almost two years on a temporary, repeatedly amended text, weakening the institutional stability and lead to a legal mess.
This new initiative has a greater division of the country.
For his opponents to the President in his " autocratic delirium, " he breaks his word " and " the right underfoot. "
On the side of his supporters, you can rest assured that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, the brothers forced to abandon their plan to explain to the Egyptians, the text of paragraph for paragraph.
For the president, it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy, while the protests raging across the country.
According to affirm, in an interview with US Weekly Abroad Time Mohamed Morsi appears to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited power of attorney," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution is supposed to end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the constitutional assembly yesterday, the text adopted in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they have turned away, as they believe that they have not been able to put their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted similarly.
To achieve the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy Members added.
Some of the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... the time has come for prayer, as some members of the panel were of the opinion that the clock of the constitutional assembly was not exactly.
The text adopted yesterday evening consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, all that remains is identical to that of the constitution of 1971, and says that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement had hoped to replace the "principles" by the "rules", which would have a stronger application.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has not changed, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," say the liberals, who see it as propaganda.
For them, according to the Islamisation of the Constitution on other items.
They are particularly Article 220 in the eye of the Al-Azhar University, an advisory role, particularly in relation to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, because " the people who will be asked to comment on it, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals will also be fuelled by the fact that the next chancellor of this university is likely to be much less moderate than the current one.
" There is currently no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, " appeased Alexis Blouet writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that " in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity, because the terms of the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh," [Islamic jurisprudence terminal Red.].
And in the future could be raised the question of civilian judges are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday strongly criticized the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they are significantly reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defense budget will not be submitted to the parliament, but a national NDC.
There will also be a ban on civil cases in military courts, as requested by the associations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears in the text, which they see as threatening freedom.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious implications for the right to freedom of expression, freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Furthermore, no article refers to the protection of women, underscores Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
They think the only positive thing is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While Egyptian President last night on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the Head of State Saturday.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants can save money on language
While MPs and civil rights activist, discussing the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for immigrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
13 million guest workers to come to Moscow, St. Peters Castle and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the upkeep of the remaining in the family home.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which each migrant labor, a test of the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local economy, housing and retail.
However, the tests of time, according to the Federal Migration Authority should in future be mandatory for all guest workers.
We must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for the preservation and extension of the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
There are also exempt from this law, people who have received their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense and protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the exam will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of international friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Peters Burger State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can pass the tests in all cities; now have already opened more than 160 corresponding centers in Russia.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
However, civil rights activist, said before the entry into force of the law several times in the press, the following question: what makes the whole thing?
What changes the rule of language, both for the Russians as well as for guest workers?
In particular, say spokesmen migration authority it seeks to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of the rights of migrant labor," says the head of the Federal Migration Agency representative in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
An organized recruitment is only 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrants without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, which is under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stayed with dozens of his same months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a great many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home will promise you one thing, and on arrival, you will have cheated on their passports and do not receive the promised reward," the head of the central administration for labor migration of Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
No ranting, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, too, that not only do they not speak the language of the country, but also in their own language to express in writing.
Of course, that is not their fault, but rather the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only afford a sound basic education.
Because in their families, there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes and clothes.
As a teenager, these children, then take the first opportunity to earn money.
"It is difficult without language skills," she.
"You feel humiliated and degraded."
Civil rights activist stress on the following important aspect of the law.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there is no investigation and, consequently, no official work.
While the majority of the guest workers continue to illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "forbidden access to unauthorized individuals"
Many migrants to confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason, bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, the legalisation of costs money: 12-16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our falsified documents and we are not registered, and then cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Spare no expense" for false papers
On the day when the Act came into force, it turned out that not only the registration of the migrants ' documents can be forged.
Some counterfeit certificates certifying the completion of tests have already been hijacked by members of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
Of course, the new owners were not in vain: every migrant, hoped to avoid such tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
That is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: the costs of a labor migrants three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, not simply the certificates can be bought, both officials and civil rights activist, agreed.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers covered by the test for the first time, that time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
In addition, new arrivals are offered without language posts in areas where no active communication with people.

Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
An extremely small percentage of legal weapons in crimes
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms law for private gun owners.
The authorities respond to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police wants to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in the public and the age for owning firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee on security and combating corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will shortly be submitted to the Duma.
Not all are happy that the Russian authorities to combat the problems with "attraction of the screws."
The Internet was published an open letter, the author, representatives of various weapons associations - by the authorities of "senseless improvements".
The percentage of crimes registered weapons is very low, the Strafrechtler, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior 142 crimes were committed with the use of the registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while 1.168 thousand offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals to serve on the black market.
Nowadays you can, according to the authors of every possible weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to officers
The weapons on the black market through multiple channels.
There are five main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website, the arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from both the Russian military officers, as well as Caucasians," says Baranez.
On the second channel illegal weapons, the regulatory guardians are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explained that include weapons, both stolen from armouries police directly by members of the criminal persecution.
Other illegally sold arms from military arsenals.
In many military camps often led to explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases, arson was to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
Contribute to the black market, according to Baranez the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories which do not stand up to international competition and therefore the weapons in the hands on the black market in Moscow," says the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production and a mafia, organized the smuggling," says the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels to supply the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report has been compiled by the Center for problem analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the Federal Service for National Statistics, forensic literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of arms.
The vast majority of illegal weapons from the army and the right protection authorities, according to investigators.
Half of all weapons on the black market are channelled through the fault of the people responsible for their work with weapons, " the report says.
The data, according to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% of thefts of weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A sales adviser of a weapons store, which does not want to be named, assured that weapons found in illegal excavations, nobody buys anymore, because they are out of date.
According to him, it is more that traders get supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A Ensign bought a weapon, a pistol type TT.
The weapon will be issued and delivered through the fence.
"The dealers brings the weapon in the city and sold it for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know about everything and, therefore, if they do not comply with the plan for the detection of crime, periodically checks by purchases from distributors who offer illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As the luxury stores"
Buyers and sellers find each other on the most famous.
I had seen Web sites and blogs, as someone who has been attentive to me, and I suggested to the station, "Begowaja" where a person would wait for me, I would be in a place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I learned first
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to get a gun, I need a friend, who has contacts," says the sales consultants. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go and arrange with a code as "Ivan Iwanowitsch, that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am currently even some shot rings on a friend whom I trust.
It gives me the blow rings just because he knows that I do not verpfeife.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez dabbled in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on this subject.
The scheme has not changed him.
He got a photo album, "everything".
"I felt like the luxury store," recalls the military personnel.
The buyer gets, according to Baranez not a pig in a poke, but you can try everything.
I buy a potential customer, not simply, but with the seller in the forest, and we are on target.
"I can shoot, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we will negotiate with each other," the expert describes the action.
Shop from your couch
Internet search engines to show search results to websites and groups in "Vkontakte, where weapons are available for different purposes."
It does not require any papers, there is still a personal meeting.
"You only need buy the appropriate amount of money," it says in the advertisement on the Web site "war pistol or rifle."
There, users enter your orders and inquiries.
Will also be sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," user "Ivan" (direct quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service recently shut countless ticket websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons, the service abound.
People like hungry fish feeding and then end up in Siberia and coal must stop pouring money
Military commentator and former military Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following way: the site is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The leaders are the orders.
The buyer pays the money via an automated teller machines (ATMs).
"In response, he received a photo and a description of the hideouts of the weapon," the spokesman told the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stressed that we can finally go away empty-handed and behind bars when placing a request on a Web page.
The Federal Security Service recently shut countless ticket websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons, the service abound.
"People like hungry fish feeding and then landing in the Siberian labor camps and stop pouring money into charcoal," he says.
A Makarow for US $100
The purchase of illegal firearms, according to the experts, is to be expected with prices ranging from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislow ' Pravo na oryzhie " you can buy a gun type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is used in military arsenals of overseers middle-rank.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes of illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 per thousand, while the number of cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.

In the US strike fast-food and supermarket workers
One in four American adolescents when behind the box office of McDonald ' s
In the past few days across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to grow, or whether they again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-profit organizations.
In addition to the increase of modest wages of simple Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests following the goal to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanks Giving the so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States, sales of the four million customers, which sometimes led to fray.
On this day, a number of Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million for their work and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists halted branches of the chain, which targets individuals in low- and middle-income.
Walmart sells all products from diapers on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in Walmart stores is, on average, between 8 and 27% lower than in large supermarkets.
The reason that many of the minor Walmart workers paid only on their own work.
The prices and the assortment of goods at Wal-Mart, one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Wal-Mart, the goods are often only sell so cheaply, because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain of severe labor conditions, including lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "black Friday" demanded wage increases, and they expressed their anger that the contribution to the company's own health insurance has risen from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, the 9.5 US dollar an hour, could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that if the company's average wage increases to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost Wal-Mart, 3.2 billion dollars.
That is about 1.1% more than they now pay.
Walmart would fully pay increases to the customers, each purchase only 46 cents more in the future.
This year they would be compared to this additional spending of just 12.39 dollars.
Supporters of Walmart satisfied that there were protests in only nine states and the company has no losses.
The Black Friday in his shop from 8 o 'clock in the evening on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this period, Wal-Mart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart-Banks on "black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington Post that "less than five" Walmart employees who work and "the protest is just another PR stunt," the union, which organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests this week in New York, where it does not, however, Walmart stores (which are not in this progressive city, and that is why they exist so far), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and ye shall not paid for honest work.
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is 7.25 dollars an hour.
In fast-food restaurants to raise the minimum wage, but not too strong, and, on average, their simple employees in New York, 8.90 US dollars an hour.
Less than they deserve, no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's, stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw this as the main source of income, or planned to stay there longer.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's, people who complain that they have to live with this wage and sometimes even their children.
On the other hand, there is in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper in a commentary, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children when you didn't know how to eat it.
The participants in the protests that began on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks from fast-food restaurants, a minimum wage of $15 per hour, which equates to more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The US-American law that prohibits the company leadership to admonish or dismiss the goal to stand in the way and union members.
On the other hand, the company leadership does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry, but it is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
The loud protests, there were also on this day, many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax of the protests was a meeting at noon before the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats said, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, said: "McDonald's says it should sell billions of chickens, and yet you granted no sick days, and ye shall not paid for honest work."
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, the mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should all support the fast-food employees so that they can reach a fair wage and economic prosperity of every New Yorker!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the US-American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the ground, which are far from everyone in the fast-food industry to work in New York, tens of thousands.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of this whole mass protest.

"The brain is only moderately fool"
The issue of enhanced reality, popular among supporters of modern technology is perceived in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first showcased in the summer, a working model at its annual conference in November, then became aware that Microsoft had filed a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technology in Microsoft's laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only a staging post.
It irritates the opportunity to manipulate virtual objects with their bare hands in the air and virtual space to create.
- Describe please, which conducts research for your group.
- We are concerned with the interaction between man and machine, want to extend the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, mankind has remained largely in the stage, which works with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes affected.
However, we want to see 5-10 years ahead, and the radical changes of this interaction.
Example of the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and today is no Xbox sold without Kinect, since all the interested in motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect interaction on a physical level, much is still on the flat-screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, and the issue has not yet decisive.
We are trying to change the work on the basis of various technologies, including projections of real three-dimensional presentation systems.
We have to dismiss the computer world in our physical world and make it more tangible.
But it is important that not only the user but also recognizes its surroundings.
Then we could be much easier to add to the real world of virtual objects.
First and foremost, we should these silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It is popular, but it will not be overrated?
- She is certainly not the solution which can solve all the problems, because it raises questions about privacy, because people do not want to inform all others on his actions and intentions.
Is any kind of interaction with computers, but their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of the management of objects in public places on a project in which we experimented with short and tight, with sprawling gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but from a bracelet registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still quite big, but it could in theory be shrunk to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future is mixed control types, example, gestures and language.
- How do it?
- We would like to ask, for example, this Sprudeldose?
They say it and interpret it.
- Normally, I will say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
- hot, you want the user adapt to what can be a machine at the time and what is not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we need to work in the near future, especially in the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to collect the reactions of people.
This could be a laser sensors, for example, in the depths of a good resolution, which is very important.
- Which claims you based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional.
Of course, an 8 megapixel would not be bad at a speed of 1000 fps.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the Matrix and depth.
So all current technologies are not good enough, because the developers of the algorithms have more work for us.
It is not only the dissolution of the X and Y, but also along the Z-axis.
The speed and the number of frames per second are important.
The movements of the people are very dynamic, and frankly, the current 30 fps, particularly for gestures are not enough.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor adjustable processing delay between 1-100 milliseconds, whereas the current commercial sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not all understand how much influence the interaction between man and machine.
I, for my work as a device, only without the light touch controls and more frames per second.
- must not increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect is currently working with three cameras, one of them is actually an infrared transmitter, and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a RGB camera.
They are not used to calculate the object.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or the problem as more calculations.
Would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera tendencies to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life, the lens has the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant, always on the road to a smartphone in the hand, but I think: the best option would be a "temporary" enhanced reality, we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone,
The lens is a personal gadget, and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but at the same time its weakness to prevent a broader reality through glasses, you can work together with others in virtual objects.
- Imagine us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air, not just Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortal.
There is a problem that critics often point out this idea: there is no tangible response.
The hands feel nothing at all!
The answers to these objections, give your group?
- In my lectures, I often talk of the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is the use of second-hand unusual projection surface.
It is perfectly true pressure!
But there are also technologies, which are designed to give the pictures in the air, something tangible, " for example, the interference of some targeted ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger, a feeling that at the moment but there is still so weak as someone spitting on the palm.
There are also bands for the wrist on the Nervenendungen in your fingers, it is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outflank the brain?
We think that it can feel what it should, if it is just something?
- This is a good idea, so we have not yet been tried.
Here is another challenge, we will still have to fight a man physically located in a closed room to believe that he is, instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; we have been working on concepts with treadmills (other than in the gym), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can only fool, and we still have many years of working.
The work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: on many issues, we are only at the beginning.

Our own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt, the project, "Peters Burger avant-garde", which is dedicated to city dwellers, who are the avant-garde art and culture.
On the list of already high-ranking representatives of the Peters burger scene that go beyond the boundaries of the city and often find recognition in Europe without having to be known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad Bärtigen, the Russian Museum, in the summer garden, scene-meeting or exhibitions.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller also attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Peters Burger social philosophical artists to create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining personality of Peters Burger avant-garde end of the 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and puts a smile to the faces of his presence on the street with his fellow citizens and provides them with good humour.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and was finally ready to Peters Burger Drehorgelspieler because it for this difficult role in terms of its artist existence, its philosophy and its image.
Kirill, why are you always in red, and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red, a fashion designer with the optics and image.
Red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society in the world.
In the company of everything, which differs from the norm, aggression and bad behavior.
But I want my provocations with the people.
Each of my last provocation was an invitation to talk.
- When you knew that you have to become a painter?
- In an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Newskij were exhibited in my work.
I realized that I have to go down this path.
Then I went to the time of the old-free, but not officially recognized as a painter at the time, and new and free painters were incomprehensible.
I befriended the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; hence, "Pushkinskaya 10", and then once was.
For me, theater, fashion, music, actually everything, except the literature.
- And all the united in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to be at the heart of the Peters burger culture, where the best creative artists.
In 1995, occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation of a musical and artistic club for bohemia, the house of Peters Burger Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz and I remember how string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
Wireless and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wore tight shirts and belonged to the now trendy composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, was removed from her "Leningrad".
Costumes mountain moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them costumes mountain and began his career, but he learned the basics.
Even the gallery "d 137" or the "Griboedov" club have their origin in the Art Clinic.
There, our employees and regulars.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there were in the press, a survey of the "people of our city."
"I won in the category of" artist of the year, and I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work under the old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
Your work - have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls, and clearly the timeliness and sharpness of the idea.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as a clown."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be socially, but now it hurts and fear.
In a clown blurs everything and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
Save the world by stipulating that any fully.
Now all the clothes and is based on the outside and not on the inside.
But perhaps we should not a people's hands, but he spit in the face.
The deception will disappear by the panel.
- Before we saw recently in the role of the urban Drehorgelspielers. - An urban culture should have a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can be commercial art?
- These days, commercial art must be cautious, respectful and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Previously, the large groups of people: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is hard to please everyone.
I am not a one-hundred-dollar note each.
Now you will have to consider, whom thou shalt.
Now every cult star has about 100 supporters.
- Among the appearances of Stas Michailow but several thousand!
- Among women abandoned him, the sexually-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, about 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money and everything.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted these pictures, even for a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
Today, there are many misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who were living in poverty and died in poverty and refused to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- Kirill what Peters Castle is missing?
- Good culture experts.
They say: servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real czar was different, because the Tsar might not seem like a lot of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In Peters Castle, we have what could be the experts, but they closed off the road, as it requires senior experts, the former properly evaluate them the way.
Now only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say that they do not accept all of the contemporary art and some painters, therefore, have to find other museums.
- What is Peters Castle for you?
- Peters Castle is not the Capital of Culture in Moscow, there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
Art is difficult to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural realm because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious to visit the exhibitions and concerts.
We are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants, the city of St. Peters Castle

Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of space vessels with people aboard on the search for a replacement planet.
In order to save the human race, the important question is, how we can reproduce microgravity or spare planet?
There are many choices, I do not believe it.
De facto, there are only two real planet we inhabit at least hypothetically.
"Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff of Sternberg Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are friendly way of life, on the surface of Venus is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The question of reproduction in space, the researchers first discussed in relation to the flora.
A half-century earlier experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of planted peas in orbit, not the least of the species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, tiny fruit fly (Drosophila) in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of the embryo.
It is a normal chicks.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chickens must stop; it must stand on its feet and start to move," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid surface, the wild chicks.
Ten hours later, the dull instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
Four days later she died.
"We have two chicks hatch and then the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them," says Vladimir Sychew the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding kennel with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the Biosatelliten "Bion" only homosexual species.
There was an experiment with rats, which have already been fertilized sent into space.
In principle, it was nothing special.
"That was the Biosatelliten, but it was only a single experiment, and the research should be continued," remarked Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the space rats.
The issue of reproduction in space could not solve.
The task is difficult.
The animals out of their natural life, cannot simply follow their reproduction.
Unlike animals, humans could in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
Ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
Yet women fly into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk in Tereshkova.
The most precious that humanity is one of the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on earth would be able to answer the following question: it survives the space flight?
After this flight, it will bring a child into the world?
"After all, no one answered the question," says space veteran guard Tang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, gave birth to the first female Soviet cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrija Nikolajew was astronaut.
In 1988, gave birth to the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja was twice in orbit, and even work done outside of the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, it remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut, a long flight, everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is for flights into orbit," concludes astronaut Valeryi Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The Hydro laboratory in preparation center of the Cosmonaut is an obligatory stop during the flight preparation.
Here in limbo, the cosmonauts routine for work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as pleasant, it is a strange surroundings, but babies water as a natural element.
It is the small Ichtyander bear witness to the fact that the life of the country rose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is approximately 9 months in the belly of the mother in the fruit, water, and that it is easier to get used to the water.
In principle, it is only logical, given birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While the weightlessness for a newborn child is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdomen and pelvic muscles rapidly, and thus the ability to extract the child.
Well, we deal with birth introductory tool.
The birth, for example, could also be held in a special chamber to squeeze the child.
"But then what happens?" Is the not insignificant matter of Valeryi Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the Erdanziehung feel the organism is not the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn baby can be put in orbit, not as an adult for training in a burden.
He is just missing what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which will bring together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to a disabled person, a completely inappropriate people to the world," says the head of the bioethics commission of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in the universe theory.
At some point, but it will become reality if the earth in their space ships to a distant planet, which is home to the All-born offspring.

NKÚ chief: control of the Black system failed due to a fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but in its application.
In the interview for Aktuálně.cz says that the Vice-President of the Highest Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied right - and I think that this is not the case," said Kala, the current situation.
A similar outcome seems a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As an example of bad practice, he leads the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "black" system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not disturb the entrepreneurs with controls, the system is prohibited or allowed?
"A law has to be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, it is not just the government, and chairman of the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint Czech-German project, in which the two countries ' laws on public contracts were compared with each other.
What did it mean?
It is a parallel examination, we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that the European legislature determines how to handle public contracts to build national legislations. And finally, there is the practical application.
All of this, we have compared with each other, and while the review is not yet complete, we could see extremely interesting differences, generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little " rigorous and perfect, but the actual application is better in some parameters in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to establish new and more detailed rules. We must also deal with the actual application of the law.
How can it help? What is for you from this project?
We are such a joint control could help stop a perfecting of laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds, if that is obviously not very good.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and illegal enrichment and criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
It may even be so that the system is only in this way with the "paperwork" and those who are looking for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold were higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
The authorities, as is the German equivalent of the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also has a college is just a little different. In principle, the two authorities, however, are similar.
The skills are similar to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, which means that there is this billing courtyards in the individual federal countries - the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only control of federal funds, which corresponds to our state.
Public funds are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the country's courts billing.
As regards the German legislation is easier than ours?
Generally, I would be without specific details are reluctant to compare. Nichtsdestoweniger Germany is often referred to as a model in some ways, but you cannot say that Germany in particular is better.
Perhaps that is because the auditors are better?
This, but as I said: I don't particularly like to such comparisons.
It should be noted that those countries that have a role model, also with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, right?
As regards the Czech legislation, the importance of your administration, the revision of the law granting you feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only a short time in power, it has so far our tests have not yet.
Because after our controls are in place, we should expect some delays.
We feel effects in the preparatory phase of future inspections, we have introduced the new control instrument "recognition of the risks of inefficiency," and with this nearly 14000 public contracts examined and analysed the impact of changes, of course, because the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of alerts were modified
You see the adoption of this law rather positive, or the system will be charged with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
It is the problem, however, that the rules are "harder" and cannot be met.
Under the previous rules are put to the test persons to the medium (example, in the event of an operational program of regional policy, the regional council) accountable for any non-compliance with the procurement law is a violation of the budgetary discipline.
However, it is worthwhile to make the law more stringent?
I do not think that way.
The system needs to exclude those who want to attack the system and abuse, and not to punish those who have committed a form of error does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
We say, first of all, what is not.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs do not bother with the controls of the so-called "black" - what does that mean exactly?
The system is prohibited or allowed?
A law has to be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, it is not just the government, and chairman of the Audit Office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, in his work.
He can say: "we change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we are acting as if nothing would.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain events - and this is also true for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, but it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid simply because of defects is excluded.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied right - and that is what is missing, in my opinion.

Šimon Ornest: our concerts, we want to gain positive energy
What do you think that the world will take place in less than a month?
This is one of those messages, which we are so happy people.
With our band The Tap Tap, but perhaps we are more fun and say that we are the only band in the world can collect enough positive energy to the world or prevent.
In December, you also have a unique project with three concerts in the world.
You can imagine our readers the project?
It is a country-wide fundraising event, which we plan to take two years.
We want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of the forecast for the December 21, at 11: 10 am.
The day before, on 20 December, from 9: 00.00 a.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which ends in a time zone at 12 hours ahead of the Mayan calendar.
By whom this idea?
Originally from me, then, we have developed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
We would like to not only collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the prophets of doom, but we also want to consider, together with the public about the state of this world for our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the prophets of doom, via www.e-tap.cz can also support the people.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, the so-called anthem against the world, with the title "doom".
Today is the national anthem on YouTube. It will resound to the charity concerts?
Of course, and, finally, provided that all is fine and the world will not...
The anthem should be sung by all the performers in all three concerts at the same time.
Furthermore, the anthems in a direct circuit broadcast live by Czech Television.
The text of the anthem of Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to the cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other leaders of the Czech cultural scene, that we realize many charity events and concerts....
We are trying to integrate these people in our projects.
It has shown that most people are interested in cooperating with us and enjoy it.
The purpose of the proceeds from the concerts against the prophets of doom?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, in which we are already six years with the club, T in the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by teachers to help them with various leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to the teachers, we want to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička Institute is a private building in which we do with this project.
At every concert, several groups and performers.
What criteria do you have chosen?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, example, Chinaski, support lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
"Big events" are planned for the future?
In May, we are preparing for the first time in the Prague Spring, and for this concert of an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to appear in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are already in the United States - would also like to associate with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not very small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistical and organisational?
It is not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users need wheelchairs are carried in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have many instruments suitcase and other luggage mitschleppen...
Nichtsdestotrotz has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I sometimes partly understood.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Your travel abroad, you have a settlement in the various countries with accessibility, as they deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnesses in Russia, in the East is still in its infancy.
To Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, alone in the city centre is on the way, it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair.
It is not obvious that a wheelchair user example, in the elevator vorlässt.
Fortunately, there are clubs try to point out the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things on which we are still lagging behind...
However, an improvement in the situation also depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people with severe disabilities themselves in public space, go to the museum, toilets etc.
But it is not usual for a larger group of disabled people actively involved in the public arena, with the band The Tap Tap the West a little.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only after significant athletes from our midst, artists, actors, politicians and law, lawyers, things really begin to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of strong personalities of goodwill.
The Tap Tap is very popular, but if we go back a few years, what has motivated in 1998 to form a band?
Then I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people, who were keen to deal with.
And since I am a musician and saxophone playing, I have founded, together with a colleague, a music-AG.
Oh, and, over time, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say anything to get out of hand. (laughs).
The band was known, but only in the last few years, I am wrong?
It is true that helped us cooperation with well-known singers; we have also begun to campaign actively for us.
We have realised that and it is not visible to the outside one's own performance in a certain sense, does not exist.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also provide good editors, high-tech equipment and the like.
It was your intention to bring it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the outset, I sensed the potential that we can approach things differently.
In the show business often copied today one of the other.
This is logical, because everything new is viewed with caution and take longer to accept.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap.
The first impression that most of the audience is, of course, compassion; it is only natural...
But that sympathy is entirely superfluous because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned nature, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop if they have the necessary funds.
I always say that if people with disabilities can not only for myself, it is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a strict boss, we hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you can make any compromises on many things, and also has a certain discipline.
I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and if they find that they have twice a week, test preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, that enthusiasm quickly extinguished.
It works everywhere, in every band that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of those were from the outset, since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group of people come and go, but you cannot prevent.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the predicted doom, Thursday 20 December 2012, around 9.00 p.m.
Events are places: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three towns event finally connected via a live broadcast, and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "doom" of the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multi-functional disability equitable education centre, under the name of STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague. The price: CZK 25 million
The entrance fee is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free maps are available at Bohemiaticket in advance.

Poland and the space.
Last week, Poland was taken at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA) as the 20th member of the Space Agency, Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (according to the Czech Republic, on 12 November 2008, ESA member).
Poland began in 1994, close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and took part in the following years several ESA projects.
Poland's path to space began much earlier, however.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos with space travel, not always met with understanding.
I remember the example of the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, the observatory at the idea of the author from his pioneering work "entrance to the Outer Space Exploration".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905), the audience, however, and after years remembered Šternfeld that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for entrance to the Outer Space Exploration " donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prix REP-Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space travel.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote several books on the scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis worldwide recognized contribution to the development of space was honored by the fact that one of the craters on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925, was built in Poland, a rail trolley for a rocket.
The author of the draft and the details of this project, unfortunately, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket will be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
The information comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered bullets.
The research work, the institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the documents that the research was up to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, appeared in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, the "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects related to the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for the military use of missile technology, coordinated by the person who was passing the scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, after two years of his work was the start of the war.
Published another article on space after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrt (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of the company in 1954 in the November edition of the journal Problemy, in the space of four long articles.
The article by Prof.M. Subotowicz proposes establishing a Raumfahrt society.
At that time, there would be the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the exploration of space.
In its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrt society PTA to accede to the International Federation for space travel was founded in 1951, and indeed the PTA was due in the autumn of 1956.
The following year became the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space flight.
He was president until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA instrumental in the development of highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM 1, was completed in 1957, the first starting on October 10, 1958.
The missile, with a maximum altitude of 1800 metres was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959 and began in the desert Blęd flight tests with the two-phased missile RM 2.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should be able to provide real scientific work, the rocket RM 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km, and for the observation of altitude winds.
However, in 1962, was set to further development.
Successor to the first missiles RM the meteor was developed in the years 1962-1965-1 rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two-phased missile, its overall length was 510 cm and weight was 32.5 kg.
This rocket have developed three types (Meteor-1A, 1B and 1c states), which are distinguished from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rocket had a transport space with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor-1B 0.34 liters and Meteor-1c states about 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude of all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, was developed in the aviation institute the meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg, at an altitude of about 60 km.
The versions of meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also worth noting is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, two years later, followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek was second astronaut.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court, the Law on charitable work.
This decision in the public a lively discussion.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a wider perspective.
The liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with one another.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages) price tensions.
Under this concept is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to pass through the importation of cheaper goods in economic competition, the "offer" competition, in order to grab a bigger share of the market and to increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their manufacturing abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Private capital because no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rise in unemployment caused, the state spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the men are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and to replace the overall social, economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital into the economies of a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is forcing its people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done by economic duress in long-term unemployment, by limiting the rights of workers.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there for several years, public Lebensmittel levy for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people who are already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy are cases in which workers get such low wages that the state to increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was uncovered in the case of the German Bundestag auxiliary staff employed.
The austerity of practically all EU-South will undoubtedly run into the same state where people are under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social levels forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century, it was the case), or for a pittance left to languish on the margins of society, and to hope that at some point, private investment capital is flowing into the country.
Nature here is the question of where the capital?
If it is from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains completely, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa, the employees are working for a fraction of the wages of Europe.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam that the State should not capital on its own people, economy, and that the economy will lead to economic disaster.
Private capital narrow insists on its position that the state is not allowed to directly intervene in the economy.
Then you have to wonder whether or not the private capital, the politics and the entire state in its own selfish sense or even.
Here is the unequivocal answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually all-powerful and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual unmistakably, legislation is practically everything, but nothing criminally punishable by law.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Department in the absence of private finance, dense with industry interrelated law firms charged with drafting legislation.
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
All the violence is not more popular as Western constitutions, but strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal democracies have been fast in a situation like the Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey ': " the state has long been in decay, and the offices occupied by force.
Against bribes, illegal Erschleichung of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown unchecked, and the people with already bought votes for the election, "... " people with character applied for posts, so that the state as a result of this decline for eight months had no consul "... " it began to really talk about it, that is the only medicine a rule in this difficult situation, and that should be a strong man "... Appian thinking at Pompey, but the strong man was Caesar, democracy permanently replaced by the one-man rule.
As it turns out, today's society is based, as in ancient times to the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, not paying attention to the overall interests of society.
Private capital is by its very nature, not in a position to see the advantage for the whole of society.
The result, now as then, is one of the decadence of the elites, not the slightest concern for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, therefore, we must look at the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current state of affairs, the downfall of this regime can be seen as a certain pause in favor of liberal democracies, in the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites to the possible future losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, which we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is no solution, at least not lasting.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition in the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to find ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
This trend is therefore system.
The only solution is a targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, increase the influence of the citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital into the company in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"... nothing from violence, or ever could," sings the Sting song Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons wanted no wars, no," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a host of reactions.
The stand behind Israel and argue with the right to self-defense, while they support the Palestinians as terrorists; on the other hand, the Palestinians argue with the racism of the State of Israel, with the genocide perpetrated in the Palestinian Arabs and the state of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point, I would not like to write about who these recurrent waves of killing guilty and who is the victim; in the end, today's residents of Israel, including the self-administrative areas were born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence have not even seen.
It is open to the readers of the behind-the-scenes look who is 95 years of tension (from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the Middle East, particularly in the small parcels of land.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and from my own understanding of who or what group of people, a great influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can consider Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether there were always these figures themselves, independently of their steps, or whether someone behind her throne, their actions drew to a predetermined destination.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is less in the hands of individuals, and that the concentration of money and the resulting power is not within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomical stands rich families, which could be described as head of the octopus (I do not know whether anyone on them, but I do not agree - the Rothschilds.
Much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was purchased by the Rothschilds in the 1890s, in order to prevent the combination of its name with high criminal acts in the background of the consolidation of its power, the propagation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the world's central banks and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they were wars, or are these (before the invasion of Afghanistan in 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were five countries after the fall of Ghaddafis remained only four, while Russia has in the meantime, its central bank of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to counter this family had to pay with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds, Bank of America as the central bank began during the civil war, their own (read: state) notes and was assassinated in 1865, in a theatre.
J.F. Kennedy began handing out their own notes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve, he was assassinated in 1963; the Member Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936, when he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global appetite for power led to the Rothschilds in 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, Freemasons in the 33 and the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at the big royalist European states to eliminate the second war, in particular, the British colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not consume so many resources), to create a universal religion (the Ökumenismus here is nothing more than the first) and eventually lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the head, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order) from chao - order out of chaos.
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like the one they created in 1907 not repeated).
It was by the murder of the Hapsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo managed to trigger the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire through the revolution, the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Czarist Russia, the war was not necessary), then the dissolution of the Austria-Hungary's Central European superpower.
The Second World War, easier to bankers by the policy of creating a latent conflict by Germany with huge war reparations, they created the precondition of impoverished masses, so they had to keep palming the Germans just a sufficiently strong leader who offered the culprits named and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should be the function of a fifth column and, in order to reignite the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds, initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state, as in the historic area of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital() return to Zion.
The aforementioned Balfour declaration laid the foundations for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it was the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler had the chain losriss, international bankers initially, or if all went according to plan, it is hard to assess, in any case, the plight of European Jews in the concentration camps, the precondition for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and was, as well as by the war reparations against Germany, preparing the ground for the Second World War, the creation of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people will like in World War II, the victims in the front line of battle, this time with the Arab and Muslim populations in the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply divided the people of supporters and opponents of Israel.
Who is the culprit, and who was the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where injustice only in an endless spiral of violence, while at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It is important to distinguish between the people of Israel and its leaders, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of fascism vulnerable to international bankers loyal dutiful politician is doing everything possible to start a war with Iran, which in the face of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...), could rapidly develop into a global conflict, and where, because of Iran's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In light of the fact that the words of David Rockefeller's 1994: "the only thing we need is a major crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation is the new world order, a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn in the birth of a chip implanted in order to subdue the essence of total control.

The film Argo: if it is the worst, Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating occupied Islamist students of the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the US, which had for decades, the patronage of his regime.
For the US government had no positive way out of this situation, it could not afford to throw the Shah, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution culminated in the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States and the subsequent failure of hostage-freeing the violent attempt made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages phoned home to a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
The debacle in Iran significantly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
Argo, the film by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode in the history of the United States a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six Botschafts employees.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran, helped them an extravagant story to cover its true identity - she travelled with Canadian passports, disguised as members of a Filmstabes allegedly visited the country locations for a science-fiction film.
The combination of genres
The plan, developed by the experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
The camouflage was credible, published articles about the film project in professional journals, held press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time a so-called "Caper movie", that is the story of a successful feat as example, the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the movie the mood levels, on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the film version of the same situations.
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and it is easy to exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA's headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table in the official gallery, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is a remarkable restarting his career with this film.
A spokesmen ridiculed actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the goal of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller No breeze (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film not in the native Boston by director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that the previous films, the director of the Hollywood standard.
Affleck, however, is also in Argo, where Tehran is played by Canada.
The best scenes of the film to play in the streets and the reconstruction of events that have really taken place - the sequence of the storming of the embassy is impressive in its simplicity, yet conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that comes when somewhere even history.
A similar effect, Affleck and his team also fictional scenes (the wrong film at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much in too many places
The director had to face the fact that the story is not a lot of exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
With a few works but quite successfully, reality sometimes nachhilft - which is not always so elegantly acts (the scenes of the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the persecution of hunting on the runway, artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad distribution, which is caused by the need to have too much to act in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their characters but deserved more space, and that they are in the film by no means alone.
Afflecks movie loses a little traction, it is a movie with some interest, and the design and reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s retro-style approve.
Enthusiasm, it is very difficult.
As a reminder of a living piece of history in some way, and as evidence of how the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is sufficient.

Guidelines for air jet of balloons, bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey about the oddest of bank charges, this year, has decided to hold the competition "most absurd regulation or idea of the EU's workshop."
"This idea that brought us the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organisation of this survey, the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities example is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women have enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are objectively for the insurance companies are less of a risk.
" More incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place by the end of February 2013, " said Nacher.
The controversial EU regulations including the mandatory blending of ethanol fuel, which is harmful to nature in its aftermath, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometer, just because this is a relatively small amount of the dangers of substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages for egg this year were much more expensive.
The comment drew criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "Butteraufstrich" or the ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 inches long
The EU machine, often under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in the rule of one or more member countries in Brussels (Czech Republic is currently trying example, including with veto threat to enforce the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests were also that bananas from the highest trade class in the EU must be at least 14 inches long, and not an "anomaly" curvature.
The European Commission defended with the argument that they only to harmonise the different national standards that would impede trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU against the resistance of some countries that the directives would lead to a loss of life.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, according to balloons in the sale must be equipped with warnings that children under eight years of the balloon puffed up without the supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study, according to the balloons are the leading cause of the drowned children.
A similar restriction applies to children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
It is quite absurd, a directive that concerns the European officials - everyone in the EU, an official function, because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece not to use the name Macedonia and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities of the EU regulation on the scope of life resources stocks on the territory of a member country.
The EU set the maximum volume of life resources stocks, on the day of our accession to the EU on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the specified volume of canned mushroom, for which threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive the money that they do not have the sea, or from the idea of funding for applications for funding.
These ideas came not from Brussels but from Prague.
" We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will be asking for a refund in the EU, " said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in the autumn of 2004.
As he argued that the grain harvest was very high and the crowded government camps as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
As the Czech Republic have another way to sea ports, should pay the Palas hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission, the Czech Republic was so well that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants to communities, the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically if it means for the establishment of conveying money requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations will easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, effectiveness and the development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, more recognition in the member countries.
In the opinion of a deeper problem, experts are more EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, together, but they have been forced by individual member countries in the budget negotiations.
Emotions in this country calls the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member countries in Brussels has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and not always wins this battle.
The Czech Republic could defend the designation " Olomoucké tvarůžky ' after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers to rename in " Tuzemák. "
The name of rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU, in the company of the world-famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola places of Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham now Charles Bader biscuits, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or the Žatec hops hops.
With an EU-brand can boast of Pardubice gingerbread or Hořicer roles.

"The people want me to save the republic, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
Mr Senator, how is the idea to run for president?
I am not trying to be a senator or president.
If everything would work without any problems in our country, I would be standing anywhere.
But I can't see the Republic plundered for 20 years, as thieves are free, while increasing people's taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And while I am over 40, independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, to run for senator or president.
In the Senate, you have done it, and then on the way to the castle.
You return to your constituents?
I said to myself the whole time that I will fight for the castle by the outcome of Senate elections.
Later, I have this and said that I shall be a candidate for the office of President, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function of the function is an instrument with which I realized my vision.
I need as much influence and a strong mandate.
But the problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but the change.
The media, the one who want to steal the honor and confuse the freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
About me example said that I would impress journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek.
We are talking about your vision.
The battle for the castle you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and retrospective assets declarations about 20 million crowns.
You have to change the laws.
As President, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole will have the law.
How do you solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have argued that the guide remains a free trader, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal is rejected, this intentionally, and that keeps the population.
As an independent party-less, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the political parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I think without drawers and party dogma of each party can take what is best for our country.
You see a man in politics to the right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
This right-left thinking, but it is completely irrelevant to me.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
It is not a question of whether someone on the left or the right, I would like to connect people.
I am always publicly any good solution approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or ODS, and I will oppose bad ideas.
It bothers you when someone described as populists.
But you have not, what you just said?
If you are in a company set up a business plan, then you have an ideal destination and a vision.
And you would like this.
This may well be described as populism, but all the proposals, of which I have spoken to function in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you just keywords.
And in the long-term policy.
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk with the people will be able to enforce the material and criminal liability example?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public, and to try to bring them to our side to enforce these goals.
As president, there would be no problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to anchor the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and state attorneys.
And the Angesprochenen would possibly say why they oppose it.
A strong personality to abuses can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, who was a credit to the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur, I am neither a genius nor a intellectuals.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I just started with the policy and try to find the majority of the support for my program.
I always try to assess the things themselves, and if it doesn't work, then I go back six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little as if Okamura, should be saved.
I am not a savior.
I know that I do nothing; that is why I have spoken with several well-known personalities, whether they want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with, for example, Radim Jančura but congestion because of work.
I have also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová fraud on trade, with light heating oil.
My candidacy, I started with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the eligible voters went to the elections, and those who are generally elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about it, because I don't have time to review the past any potential party member, and don't have the money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only 20000 CZK.
They have no money?
They speak of wealth statements, what would your?
I value my private assets to about 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million art collection, which is about 10 million is worth, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu superb, approximately one million worth, and then I have a few million in the bank account.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond I liked, like he was in the car, galant on women and fighting against evil.
You are driving an Aston Martin, has a capacity of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money.
This is not very convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I have 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program probably not too much interest.
And I am not committed to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are in fact covered by my salary as a senator.
But the senators salary, I could not live alone; for example, my son, I could not finance the English school, which costs 30000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I would stand for nothing at all.
So, you as an entrepreneur, to have your livelihood?
You said that you drive back these activities?
But that is not dependent on the level of salary.
As promised, I have reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy in the spring of business leaders of the travel agencies.
People want to see me as a Samaritan, saving the republic.
But I have to live on.
In which month income were used as an entrepreneur?
Some 200000 to 400000, and continue to do so.
As President, I would set my adventures, however.

The MVRDV architects to prove that the true adventures are not only in the head, the example of Spijkenisse, and the mountain of books recently built - 2 photos
"I think the building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there is to see something interesting," said Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians at a nearby wholesale company, says: "it is nice to the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is still today voluntarily in one of those old-style libraries?
Spijkenisse, a little sightseeing sleep deprived town just outside of Rotterdam, outlandish world record holder.
The 80000-resident community on the lowest Bildungsrate throughout the Netherlands.
To counteract this silly circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to the general education and seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro seem pretty brush Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the offensive was education.
And so the city fathers realized that there is only one way, the statistics: a library.
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of great daring bar graphs and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared on the competition hearing in 2003, with five books under the arm and a big smile on his face.
And while the jury looked intrigued and shrugged his shoulders, stacking the cheeky Maas, the size of its fine jewelry into a pyramid and finished his actionist founded speech with the words: "love town!"
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million is expensive.
It is part of a revitalization project, belong to the underground garage, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 flats.
At the beginning of November, the books mountain was awarded the second prize of "best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
It is the small town of facial retort, which until now had more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, the white facades, one could be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all has Spijkenisse's first public culture in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: books paradise under glass case.
There is a lift, through the hills, but the real area of reading pleasure at the nearby climbing the topography.
The all-around glazed interior is bright and clear, burned Klinkerboden and elegant street lamps, unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
We are already looking for park bench, dog and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and is located in the middle of a large, dark space, which is both uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic room configuration on its head and reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the books Bergs is sent in the middle of offices, Internet library, chess club, Environment Centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure is the black bookshelves, wall panels, parapet, stairways are railing.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard shake architects and civil engineers the unknown building offs.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen farm one day came across a waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a milli-meter thin plastic fleece as the root surface.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, then it is ready for the bulky.
The library was pressed the fleece - for the first time in these quantities to four centimetres thick plates.
Discolored under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material, which was a little for new cars and a little reeks of sports shoes.
We arrived at the summit after 105 stages.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre-long tour, you will be rewarded in the Literary Cafe, not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in literature Mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces, a flagship project in terms of ecology," said Trouborst.
Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the books mountain under a glass of fall, the sun shines briefly on sunny days, the interior.
The broad Holzleimbinder standing across the glass facade, shading and captured a large part of the Sonneneinstrahlung.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Do the rest fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics ventured out of the IT industry, the path to the new library.
Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul."
The reason: the opening a few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection.
This is to be filled for the optical gaps in the not-yet-fully-stocked library - currently 70000 pieces.
The concept is.
The shelves are filled up above.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
" I think our invitation has now all residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
If only.
This makes MVRDV who succeeded King discipline called in the jargon of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
As young and uneducated.
This is a starting point for identity.

Szabo: " Germany must play a greater role '
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations in Berlin, balanced on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now Germany because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a flight ban.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
It is difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it was precisely his foreign policy, away from a policy that were managed by the United States, a German foreign policy.
Worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are between the fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think they fumble their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have in France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy in concrete terms, from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy of the exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from those of the other great powers, to a certain degree, and that is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
That is why we must be careful not to alienate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
It plays a role.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining in important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe, and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic collapse in the Libyan issue.
Maybe Germany will even some respect.
It signaled that it should be considered as an international player to be taken seriously and its interests.
There are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States have called for a veto.
There are differences of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These differences have always existed because of American domestic politics.
I believe that the Obama administration has secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation, the government will not publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they seem.
If the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so upbeat about Netanyahu's policies.
It is hard to reconcile Germany's close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU, on the other side?
I believe that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they can be part of a wider line and instead have their own position.
They are currently using the euro.
I believe in the future, Germany will play a leading role to push Europe into a European position.
Of course, that is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I think that the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player, Germany's desire to play a major role?
Germany, or the leadership role it still?
Germany is not accustomed to that is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a greater role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because each time Germany assumes a greater role in various anti-German feelings.
It is not just the Germans.
This is the old problem: you want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in European politics, the EU is currently not filled the vacuum, but who is?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like it is inconvenient for them, and they are much less popular, c 'est la vie!
Stephen Szabo is deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together to explore the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Brand protection" in China: Puma and Armani suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani polo?
Behind this lies a name officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the origin of companies.
However, it has long protection, not the actual name donors.
And even then, it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Patt hole, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing, specialised in protection law violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The copying a few additional letters, so that they can register their brands.
So from Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada, instead leaving Prada-Kny.
German companies are legally copied in this way, such as the Sportartikel manufacturer Puma.
Patt hole opens a folder with entries of the Trademarks Bureau in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art names, the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese are the world champions in the copying and the injured, intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there is a storied department stores, which sell almost exclusively to counterfeiting.
Patt hole, though, there are different: on behalf of its clients, it is the fact that Chinese companies officially by the Trademark Office granted the right to use a term which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is based on "bang Dakuan."
This refers to women, rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"It is damaging to business, we must combat it," says Patt hole.
"The brand will disappear, the unique position of image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and litigation costs of the affected industries in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the third largest market for luxury items, and the fastest growing.
But deletions dubious entries in the register trademarks are hard to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years in the process, with uncertain results.
Patt hole reported cases in which the court's actions, because of the long duration of the name, "complained of the" reality of the market.
If the plaintiffs have bad luck, he had to pay the Plagiator even money because it violated its trademark in China, says Patt hole.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases involving graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over the German Betonpumpenbauer plaster masters.
The Chinese must use an emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely used originally a blue and white logo to BMW, the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits that there was due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
Last year, but from the "emergency employment expiration returned to normal life."
The stock is raw appeal procedures declined by 22 percent.
Nearly 57000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office still 81500 appeals to completion.
Address that costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and meant that China for the 10th time in succession, the list of Neuanmeldungen go around the world, with the authority.
This also applies to the inventory of all the valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
In 2011, were 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
Simplified, it means that any application costs, on average, 1280 yen or euro.
To address costs many times, as the case of the German company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
The Germans were able to ensure that mimic the illegal manufacture of motor vehicle parts was mined.
But the terrorists remain the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg.
You have failed, because families in Germany could not be protected, said Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the business leadership of Freudenberg Chemical available in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two instances rather Freudenberg, but the process opponents fighting continues to this day.
We need to watch
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the process is extremely time-consuming, and it costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs barely quantify the company's archive, even through a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg, the other side, in vain, "a high six-digit euro sum" to the settlement.
"You can see how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to Europe zurückzuschwappen.
Then if adopters too vulnerable brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
This business field has long since abandoned the group, but he could turn the registration.
"We need to watch," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Patt hole German companies to be very cautious in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, the foreigners "everything is somehow worth protecting, including in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his trademark filing drama, then you would have to pay the other side of licence fees for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the segment in question.

World AIDS Day: help assuage sing
In Heidelberg rehearse in the chorus Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are glad about it.
The story of a relationship more than 8733 kilometers.
First the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies ' pumps and Herrenslipper on the parquet floor the beat him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Then, as it shrinks the voices of the singers - slowly - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano harass and captivate.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost from its cloth shoes when he brings together with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday night in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg rehearse in the chorus Imbongi a new song.
The 50 singers, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Human Genetics, to the house.
' Om ' Obani ' is not a simple piece of every choir has a different text and even in a foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide there are about 34 million people infected with HIV, the estimates Unaids, the United Nations Programme on Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
Living in Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni has found the association Voices for Africa godfather in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a sponsorship.
It assures the child school fees, uniforms and a hot meal every day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu storytellers or worship.
The Bantu language fluently speak nobody in this room, but sing.
Nearly ten years since the choir performs songs in this strange soft language and brings them to where they originally come from: in the South Africa.
Because 8733 kilometers away as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they are one of the HI virus.
In Esitjeni is small, quite Swaziland suffers highest HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Restrictions of the male foreskin, the risk of contagion proven to reduce by half of the population.
More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland the immunodeficiency virus to die in the middle of thirty is not uncommon.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis many children on the streets, not only a lack of parental care, but simply of everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school in a poor country, certainly no chance.
Initially, it was more private involvement of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to allow him a hot meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa," since almost professionally the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections.
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI HIV, human Pappilomaviren, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and itch are parasitic STI.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and Tripper primarily in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all syphilis cases in Germany, reported to be transmitted by sexual contact between men.
Among the heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, Candido (mushroom), Tripper and human Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country low comparison, however, about 20 percent of HIV infections in this group.
Among the young chlamydia infections occur far more frequently than other demographic groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25 years.
In this country are also often human Pappilomaviren among young people.
As the number of infections has developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis infections has more than doubled, according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 illnesses in 2011.
The number of HIV infections since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
Symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints when I urinated, flow, lower abdomen pain and blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms, and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
As part of the agent of sexually transmitted diseases can also be infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend especially for frequently changing Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Diagnosed early, most of the STI cured and delayed effects can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and last but not least, the fee, which the choir in Germany ersingt, comes together.
"Overall, we have about 200000 euros Esitjeni sent," says Annette Lennartz has, the chairman of the association.
In the village of self-administered Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and strong woman enforcement money from Germany.
She also takes care of the orphans staying well, one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as it is called the old women on Zulu are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have added up to 14 orphans, giving them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children in their uniforms every day just in time for the school.
Anyone who has not come into the house of protection to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, "voices for Africa" a Nähschule launched two chicken houses and organised in conjunction with the American health organization PSI, that many in the village of an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because obviously the disease around the country, it is silent, preferably dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz has, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, who is known for his excessive life style.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also owed to the state-sanctioned life form, the HI-virus spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
While there are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz has, " but rarely used.
The culture is different, flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange, something the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years, together with the South Africa and sings songs of longing, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern tip of the black continent, even in times of apartheid.
A bus full of albacore, singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only mood and joy, but also has some fierce border guards, a few tears abgetrotzt.
The journey continues even after Esitjeni, where the singer to visit her foster children.
Even though the small village of little on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River is more than aware of.
"After Esitjeni because the light is saying" the people there.
And if the 8733 miles as the crow flies to Heidelberg is returning to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room at the Bergheimer Strasse, then you see it.

Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has found evidence that the planet Mercury.
The ice might be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is the sun in the next, there are also frozen water from three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger spacecraft have found evidence that there is an ice in the permanently in the shadow of region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 cm and perhaps even up to 20 metres thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that are on the Mercury.
No one put the discovery of ice, but with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings could help to resolve such as water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth citizens as Phoenix probe, telescopes and a small robot to explore the depths of the universe.

Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope will be invented by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei began a year later to star.
Since then, the mirror of the optical telescopes ever greater, and the insight they provide.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Teles Cope.
It looks into space on two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Teles Cope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, a diameter of 11 metres.
Disadvantage of cheap construction: the telescope is laid down in its elevation angle - and limited in his mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is fixed in the altitude angle.
Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is enough, despite the settlement, a small mirror diameter - the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers All for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the " search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help every computer owner by computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Teles Cope - that makes its name.
With its four mirrors the telescope can also be adjusted to the medium-sized infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean Observatory (ESO's European Extremely Large Teles Cope is planned.
Its main mirror is a whopping 42 yards - and nearly 1000 mirrors elements.
With photos but is expected until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea, as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea--observatory, with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF into the sky alongside them.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is intended to create a new giant telescope with a mirror-average of 30 meters.
Here is an illustration.
However, the main impressions from space, the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it provides images of faraway worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler for extrasolar planets - mainly those that are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 was determined by the Nasa announced that 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture are the last launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Teles Cope (JWST) until 2018 aboard a Ariane5-spacecraft.
The primary mirror of the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the south pole of the Mercury ice exists.
However, there is no reliable data because the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolves around the planet.
Radar measurements have for decades, hingedeutet that there is ice on Mercury.
The 2004 launched Messenger probe - the first revolves around the Mercury, the scientists now have certainty.

Daily drink butter - 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97-year-old young comparison.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country in the 97-year-old young comparison.
The trip by the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The mini-bus rumbling through the winding road, past densely wooded hills and rushing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan's border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
The Caucasian population group of Talyschen, not much is known, except that it is perfect Farsi and Azeri and very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town of flaunts to impressively terrible architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists from Europe come here is too onerous, the directions from Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
The 323 miles you need eight hours because the street is not high enough.
The fabulous wealth of the country's oil in the Caspian Sea, has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the potential to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, the only one in the world.
The Vita is documented in the area of about eight dozen Talyschen older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years fathered a child
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
A birth certificate, but there is not.
And given the oldest documented person was 122 years old, seems to Müslümovs age very doubtful.
"In 1805, he was born in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 years he fathered a daughter.
Has Şirali Müslümov at his age for a couple of decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the very elderly in Central Asia.
"A striking number of hochaltrige people is also available in some parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "live in Sardinia, huge numbers of very old men."
Due to a lack of documentation, however, there was no scientific proof of age, because in my opinion.
Every day, cup melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often, a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many high elderly?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the particular genes of Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that it is in the eating.
But the calorie-rich diet of Talyschen should be healthy meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love, and many of those daily drink a glass of melted butter, appears from a scientific point of view of food is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people in Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years for this popular young comparison.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel they tirelessly and creates.
Eight people live under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents.
Also, two small children.
In the kitchen, the guests tea is served in the characteristic, belly-shaped Armadu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect and link, hidden under her headscarf, long, dark blonde braids, her son proudly unveiled in front of us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, they never went out and retained their color.
I have never used, "" shampoo, says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
It has only ever eaten what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in the supermarket life.
She tells of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the " beloved father Heydar Aliyew took power.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which the Father of the Nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power, his son Ilham took the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva per month as a pension, an amount which can live for local conditions.
And, perhaps, has Mirzayevas long gray son: "the elderly in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved and cared for, are happy.
If that is no reason for as long as possible to stay alive

The word ' lack of human rights in the Constitution "
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution of sharia as the basis is hotly disputed.
Egyptian President not sparing with pathos.
We must create the transition.
"And that he will succeed is my responsibility before the people and before God," he said in the State Fernsehen.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular fuels.
Because they all have, so far, hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of a state of the Nile, God of Grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, almost apologized, Mohammed Morsi, temporarily curtailed the powers of the constitutional court and expanding its competences, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD in the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
In fact, Article 234 of Islamis table dominated the 100-member constitutional assembly in a nightly 15-hour Parforceritt pushed through, in part, worrying.
As in previous constitutions in the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
That was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is feared that the Islamists, the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At least, that a new article: guided in all matters affecting the Sharia should consult the Al-Azhar University, the country's main Islamic institution with great clout in the whole of Sunni Islam.
This does not, but it may mean that the clergy supervised the legislation, which would be the de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
The Verfassunsgsentwurf is a matter of interpretation
Also problematic: the civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained.
These dishes served to the repression of opponents during Mubarak's rule.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11000 civilians in military custody.
The state should protect, as stated in the draft, " the true nature of the Egyptian family " and promote its morals and values. "
This is legally so unclear that state institutions, with the help of this article could even control the content of the film, art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no articles explicitly stipulates equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits insulting the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys or to slander.
But what is an insult, and how they should be punished, remains unclear.
Equally questionable is the wording of the "insult to the people" is prohibited.
Here is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a law scholars?
Sizing thing, like so much in the design, Morsi to sign, and in his words, "very soon" the Egyptians will be presented to the people to vote.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition formed for weeks against the excessive power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and praised the Charter, before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of presidential elections.
Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, "the constitutional draft belong on the scrapheap of history."
Via text messaging service Twitter, he accused the Morsi supporters, "a" coup against democracy.
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and unseat him," said the opposition persuade Yasser Said.
"We are not yet tired of the blood of our brothers is not punished," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they would not supervise the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood blew themselves on the counter-demonstration, to take precautions, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer from Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafis took part, shouting "the people calling for the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi, "cleansing the country!" And protested: "the Koran is our constitution."
A battle for control of the emblematic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have led to civil war-like situation.
It did not want to risk of Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood, both opponents of the constitutional draft and supporters have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is considered safe.
"The word human rights, not even"
Hafez Abu Saeda, is furious about this forced constitutional process, which would have until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their beliefs, but because for him, human rights are indivisible.
He was sentenced, beaten, imprisoned.
" And now is not the word of human rights in the new constitution, " he complained in the interview with the Welt am Sonntag ".
Morsi power extension to all three powers in the state of the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of the game, and Egypt will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president it de facto," laments Saeda.
A democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned by the international community, which considers the ideological direction of struggle on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could backfire.
A protestor in Tahrir warns: "you gebährt a monster that you can't control."

Rakfisk from Norway: this is the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Could the secret to the success of the country have something to do with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese.
They place in the middle of a pile of dirty, humid sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
So imagine the nasal stunning smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
I am in the tiny town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and this persistent smell in the air, just won't go away.
Rakfisk is fermented with salt sprinkled trout, which, depending on how you stink of fish would like - up to a year in water.
When the darkness of the country in Norway and the weather gets colder Norwegians flock to a festival in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very impressive speciality.
"You eat it raw and then washed it with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General," the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people more than the Rakfisk" aquavit, says Harvard.
The alcoholic beverage can replace the smell.
I eat a few bites.
If it avoids the Rakfisk in near the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling capabilities and fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In deepest winter, he was taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt - with the help of alcohol consumed subdued senses.
A generation ago forced thousands of Norwegians in search of work, to leave their country, mainly in the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming labor market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, who not so long ago was much richer than Norway, flows of immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, if strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive dishes, you can buy here.
But here is all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs impressive 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the press of the world, and most people do not seem to care.
Here you hate it still, Anders Breivik to those racist right extremists last year shot 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in its peace-loving country.
It is responsible for today's wealth in Norway since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why it is so good," says Anna, our waitress, the circular trays with seasoned Rakfisk and the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as it prudent people.
Her English is just as most of the people here.
We are not very tinhorn, we may not boasting.
Norway is very careful with its oil wealth - a large proportion of industry revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years up to the world economic crisis all threw money around, that they had not, Norway closed its wallet.
"As long as we can in the winter skiing and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk eat," she adds with easy laughter.
I am standing in the snow and on another court, I have had enough of Rakfisk.
I am a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat.
But in the evening, the Stinkefisch on the menu.
The hotel where I stayed, is one of a number of event locations, which can organise a Rakfisk Dinner, where guests for the best - or, perhaps, the sense of smell the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV broadcast a show master dressed with fly by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Our priorities are," Harvard.
Applause and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But it is perhaps the severe haze of the whole fish.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico's incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepared for his inauguration, Will Grant analysed by the BBC, the challenges and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even in better days, this is a congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, seal of several important transport routes in the capital and on the streets of chaos.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will tie the president and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon's Mexico can prove economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60000 lives over the past six years.
"My government is fully committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office of the U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy to achieve this goal.
Before he went to the US president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large parts of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo remembered example of him.
Residents of the holiday village him write the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on the highways, the Pena Nieto built and a major improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads here.
Plaques associated with his name outside of a modern sports centre and an impression full interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change," his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a Congressman for the party, Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, as regards the security and the economy, we hope to have an interesting and real change in our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI has been replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he declined.
He is a very direct guy, very committed and have great plans for the country.
He is an excellent State man, above all, he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view on their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo, could not be greater.
The town lies hidden under motorway transfers and is in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems are in the village of critical urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military has been switched to the drug gangs operating in the districts and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a patch of fallow land in the vicinity of a large landfill were left alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women in the last two years.
During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the state of Mexico, more than 1000 women - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the killings of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is the problem of the murders of women during his term of office, at least not adequately addressed.
But in the worst case, his government had closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete, typical of the decrepit quarters, Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at her, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten and corpses had already begun.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana us. It is next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, the family has refused until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, whiner.
They want us to accept their verdict simply and the mouth.
"But it is not possible when there were so many flaws and omissions," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the president bandage, he takes a big responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were promised in the past six years of violence, and the new president, particularly during his time in office to take care of this problem.
"I hope that as president he is when he was governor," said PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But fear of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza.

The prosecution alleges: Bradley Manning was not complaining about mistreatment
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Mannings accusations that he was mistreated in prison
The hearing dealt with Mannings time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense is seeking a rejection of the charges due to harsh prison conditions
The Corporal of the US army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor has tried on Friday, the army accused release of Corporal Bradley Manning - the biggest disclosure of confidential information to the US-American history, missed several opportunities to complain about the alleged abuse suffered in military custody.
In a cross-examination Mannings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents on weekly visits by prison officials while Mannings nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, had no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request from the defense to reject the charges, Manning is the hard prison time had already been punished enough, Manning testified he considered in prison, the suicide.
The intelligence analyst in the US Army, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was released by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks, Manning was the source of the information was never verified.
At the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning in the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico military prison, where he completed by July 2010 to April 2011, enhanced conditions entered.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As Feinstein quizzed him on Friday to the forms, Manning admitted that he had the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment of a "very professional".
The forms, so fine, no complaints about ill-treatment, although the officials Manning had directly consulted on his treatment.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressing his concerns and the officials have discussed this with him, and to deal with them, but they have not been logged.
"They (the concerns) meeting," no problems ", and this is not necessarily that I said nothing at all," Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he complained about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011, the mentioned suicide thoughts of him a few months earlier on a form.
Manning answered his intention during the meeting, to be his observation status to "prevention of injury".
The military said, he was assigned to the restrictive status - one step below the suicide threat - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to get rid of employees that it went well, and the observation status on the prevention of injury (...) at a higher quality of life, from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning said his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained nearly two months before he was transferred in July 2010 in the prison of the naval base Quantico in Virginia.
He said he had contemplated suicide in Kuwait and even unconscious because of the heat.
Not knowing what was happening with him, or in the outside world, was wearing.
"My world fell on Camp Arafjon, this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell at least 21 hours - and often - more than 23 hours and society.
He allowed only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving, because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even.
He always had to sleep with the light in his cell.
If he had turned up at night and guards could not see his face, had woken him, so he is back.
In January 2011 rose Mannings lawyer formally objected to the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011, Manning in the military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also inquired of a charge that he had made in his statement on Thursday, he had a night to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, naked and face guards and other prisoners in the census.
Manning had testified he had never had the opportunity during this census, with its ceiling.
At the hearing on Friday, Manning, he concluded from a command to his guards that he would be able to cover the ceiling, with which he should. " He admitted, however, that no one had asked.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was in the previous night, forced to sleep naked. He had tried to show an officer that he poses no risk to himself.
Manning told the officer that he would use the federal his underwear or his flip-flops to injure themselves, but not done so.
On this night, Manning said his underwear, flip-flops and glasses have been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take into account his detention and his Haftmaß drastically reduce, he should be condemned before the military court at his trial, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will be less offense to plead guilty, while others face charges that are considered too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecutor is expected to be a justification of the conditions.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all the prisoners in the highest security in Quantico custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful release of intelligence on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
He is found guilty on all counts, he faces a life sentence.

My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced, because of the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times in memory, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport control as disturbing to me.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("aliens").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of which I should go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life has been called "Mexicans".
An ethnic shortcuts - just as my friends in Boston, "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I opted for the "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens in the home of my grandfather.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, or at least good enough to compete in this language on both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and my American accent, I will not go ahead.
So I took my American passport and asked me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues that are expected if the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy is one reason that Mexicans today, as likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc after the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even though he had no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with distrust.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single idea that the United States in Mexico in 1848 and the leadership of the country under the barrel of a gun, forced to leave them with more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries, not in minutes, not to overlook the memories of this event.
Therefore, once a U.S. government official even mildest criticism in Mexico - in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans, the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children of Monte Zuma's pass on the war path.
And yet the greatest challenge in Mexico is in fact in the relationship with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point, a person in our family tree, perhaps one of the parents or grandparents - a chance in Mexico and emigrated to the north.
And in most cases, this person is a profile, dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may have to live the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred, sometimes perhaps, but our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial to a humiliating defeat and look at us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
They think that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If not, our families in Mexico had failed, they would not.
And then we would not now be caught behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child, immigrated legally in the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take them.
While the US State is a citizen, it sees itself as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican-Americans, I know the feeling of belonging, neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but there is not one of them.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican command people and parts of the education bourgeoisie to resume ties with the Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great is a visit to the country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And, given the unequal income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid you alone, amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico, a century and a half ago, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a grudge for their family members were just not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove an unexpected cornerstone for peace
There will never be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to have a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual recriminations were killed, countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis - and, for the first time rockets from Gaza are in the vicinity of the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to suspect that the deadly standoff could finally end.
A war neither lost nor won
At first glance seems optimistic given the current situation were inappropriate.
Even if the cease-fire agreed on 21 November the this week's battles have strengthened the Hartgesottenen on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, although his group even large losses.
Although a number of Hamas leaders killed and 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in a bleak and packed densely populated corners of the planet, it is not managed until now, Hamas to destroy Israel.
Indeed, Hamas wins in the Westjordanland, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders might come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have grown in influence in the Arab world, Hamas has powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a revival of regional power, once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the Hamas party - as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels have an increasingly Islamist-style, before Bashar Assad falls could be up to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of President Muhammad Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, the most by far the inhabitants, and most important Arab country on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 for 30 years, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas verschwägert and their leaders are more dependent on people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove as a player, even by Israel and the United States cannot be excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer dangerous.
The Israeli missile defense system, the "iron Dome", and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep.
In diplomatic terms, unwavering, the United States and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although the rockets from the Gaza Strip killed 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least because of the security wall has gone into the Westjordanland and thus in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state. This to protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared for international law, but always be developed further.
Netanyahu. His Likud Party in the run-up to the elections on January 22, Avigdor Lieberman affiliated with a militant group.
Why this nanny cunning Palestinians and left to their own state?
If they really had control of the Westjordanland, they would not like their colleagues in Gaza also fire missiles?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish you should dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners. But the Arab spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists in Egypt and other countries are in power, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the problems in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower is hardly new Arab governments to help repair its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi, working with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a cease-fire, could be a sign of promise - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians are still deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt will explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as this week blew up a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is undermining the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate the situation.
Bloody missions to curb Hamas in the Gaza Strip are increasingly over the years, its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a nudge from outside
The answer is that the more sensible people on both sides, the bulk of the rest of the world, and is represented by this newspaper: two states, Israel's security purposes areas.
The small, for the near future, hope that the cease-fire outside grants more power to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now work together with Turkey and Qatar to stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas by the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by area of exchange and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders, Arab nations should also encourage Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would be done more for the creation of a Palestinian state with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama also needs to do its bit to push Israel to negotiate.
He failed the vision of his own peace plan during his first term.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also unwilling to participate in it.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australian laws for single cigarette packaging in force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia, entered into force, brands, logos and colors will be replaced by a neutral, olive cap, moreover, are printed with sharp images, which show sick body parts and cigarette smoke sick infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images from next Saturday, the only difference between the packs in the brand names that are identical, small letters.
Australia to lead the world's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of smoking.
The government of studies have shown that people who have not yet started to smoke, 26, with 99% probability, not more.
"You can already see in children younger age, that they understand the message we are trying to apply for the tobacco companies with their brand image," federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. It cited studies that example, have shown that children's crown logo associated with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking quotas in the world and the changes are only slightly affect the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was said, with the laws of the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more readily accessible.
"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd., a small family business, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and silicone to cover the unbearable packaging has grown enormously since the corporations, British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed with their appeal against the law in the Supreme Court in Australia two months ago.
Zico had up to 6000 units sold to wholesale stores and waiting for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook is the popularity of social media in precisely the demographic group, to which the plan.
A number of Australian law has banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, which is a sports sponsors, and most traders forced cigarettes in shops no longer. Now the tobacco advertising on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned by local companies and online advertising pages, but it has no influence on the international pages.
"He who sells tobacco and has only a small area to advertise its products can't do without the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in the nature of health at the University of Sydney.
On social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman noted an increase in reports of experience to brands that have been written by "ordinary people".
We must ask the question: is this just a private person who is so much fun with Marlboro cigarettes that even a video or a marketing agency has to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of focusing on marketing to deal with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules, those countries complain to the World Trade Organization over unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries more trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
Plibersek, according to the government has held talks with other countries are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, the photographic warnings.
Now they have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers defiantly.
The images do not affect me.
I ignore.
"It is just a touch away, and the box," says Victor El Hage when buying a pack of cigarettes is printed on a photo with a mouth tumour.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I should stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, operators of the "King of the Pack" tobacco trade in the city of Sydney, says the single packing the filling its shelves.
"I needed an hour to classify a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have been easy to completely ban cigarettes - then we would have said okay, that's it, we are close," he adds, visibly angry.

In a world constantly electrifying, it is nice to be bored
I spent this Thanks Giving unexpectedly five hours in the airport, as our plane because of mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom.
I will not lie.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is quite annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping).
But more and more academics and child development expert boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us and our children - okay, sometimes bored.
The brain is forced to lose in interesting thoughts, which promotes creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly on a screen, rigid, the benefits of boredom, not more.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back to this point.
How many people I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, which has developed, with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: a Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
"In fact, the boredom has a very long history," he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom in many ways been defined and discussed.
After a long reading of the research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that the experience, "to a satisfactory job boredom, but this does not define".
Boredom is different from apathy, therefore, that the person is not, but it would be.
The apathy, however, there is no desire to do something.
The key to the experience of boredom, he says, is in a "disruption to the attention of process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can listen to almost like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be linked to see bored people, the problem in their area or the world, while depressed people, the problem in itself.
Sometimes, we believe that it is boring, even if we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study, "the Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention" - roughly translated: "the inert mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which was published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues in an earlier experiment, in which participants listen to a band, in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud TV program from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content of other heard it on low volume, so it was hardly perceptible, while the third group not heard these noises.
The people who heard the barely audible television said to feel more boredom than the other two groups, they have had problems to focus on these could find no reason for their difficulties and wrote the boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate Professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
But if you put a monotonous work, "as the search for defective products at a factory conveyor belt, music can help and not get bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people physically attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who herumhampeln must learn more and more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually get bored - my delayed flight, a booming loudspeakers, a particularly shun dull, tedious film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s, a range of Langeweile vulnerability. "
On the scale are statements such as "many things that I have to do to repeat themselves and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers have found that boys will be more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly on the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are a bunch of pretty slack.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and Gemeinwesens development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and perform the tasks, while 23% said to be bored when they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said that they are bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he did not know whether the percentages have risen about the boredom or dropped.
He was sure, however, that "the youth is regarded as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have a big impact on their daily lives.
So, back to my origin question: boredom is healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it means that people take extreme physical risks and all the happiness or drugs to relieve them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is Professor Vodanovich, researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom, the brain will say that we should do something else," Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what we should do.
If it is boring and you use that energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
But the television in the short term for happiness, these feelings evaporate but in the long term.
Anyone who goes to his bored child an iPad, so it can distract from the boredom, but has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "self-control is transferred from one situation to another."
The child learns not only to entertain, but also in other areas, more self-control.
I do not believe that we should be celebrating boredom.
We should also not critical.
Instead, our aim should be to feel at home, away from the ongoing activities and drip irrigation technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people in truth only looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is hard to look if the noise is muted."

There are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law in Colorado.
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in the south-east of Colorado for a crime in court, which will soon be legal in this state: the possession of a few chunk of marijuana and a pipe he smoked.
Orozco says he and some friends in a car days in Lamar, near the Kansas border, when they were stopped.
After the police found marijuana in the car, Orozco was for possession of drugs and Drogenutensilien subpoenaed - Kavaliers offenses, each with a fine of US $100 - and received a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," Orozco.
But it is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of smaller, less drug-related crimes from the law than the location.
Hundreds of regulatory obstacles, which revolve around marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, the approved similar measures have already dropped.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years for possession of small-scale. This is permitted by law, once the new laws in the next few weeks to come into force.
But state lawyers in more conservative districts Colorados have announced to follow existing marijuana offenses, people are still in court.
At the same time, several cities, the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains, to prevent a new, state-licensed marijuana stores in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so quickly that I didn't know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which is located east of Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the federal state of Washington, scratch their heads at a loss.
They are waiting for an orientation aid to set up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is of the opinion that, in any case, most states of Colorado is the regulation of marijuana was legalized the drug only for medical purposes and for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, the state is so good for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and the end of a grey area in which the state license system does not yet exist, but it is legalized the possession.
And the unpleasant practice issues that need to be addressed at this time, for example, as the government target of a "reasonable access" to license marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within a radius of 300 metres at schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities.
" No, it will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the agglomeration of Seattle, " says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal cannabis ", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent his employees in an e-mail, he said, the state attorney would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years, and that the police would "immediately" no prosecutions for such offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to urban standards to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue.
In Weld County in northern Colorado represents District State attorney Ken Buck a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to the withdrawal.
Currently must answer 119 people for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, though many have been charged for other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations, which point to the time of the offence to crime," saying in a statement.
The reactions are in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, shows adults no longer for the possession of small amounts of it.
State district attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but not all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I don't think I wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes," he says.
While 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal use of marijuana with the complexities of government and justice system.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the country promoted a profound dilemma among local officials, the big green experiment.
In state district attorneys a cultural barrier, " said Sean McAllister, a law attorney in Denver, the defendants standing trial for marijuana crimes and acts locally as spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent a large part of their lives to prosecute people that they can still do not accept the legalization," he believes.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as a national pattern of cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to prepare for an era of legal sales, they also are waiting nervously on orders of the federal government, which the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level will continue to be treated as a crime.
Advocates of legalization movement hope will give the Ministry of Justice.
Despite several great deal of attention when arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government, the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration believes that investigators probably will not close any doors to confiscate small quantities of drugs, but it will probably be reluctant to condone under the new legislation, legal, government-regulated marijuana shops.
Wait several cities in Colorado, not the federal authorities.
Even before the polling day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although this could open in a year.
Last week decided to Montrose, a city in the West, a six-month ban, which will probably be adopted next week.
"We do not want to get into a position in which we license and then somebody at the federal level is a big issue," Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community has voted against this law change.
We have done this for the community, not for what was decided by the state.
There are still many questions unanswered.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am a Tory
Not only university students today attacked for her views
It has always been my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my elder brother had visited the university, which I thought was once the largest knowledge stamp in the world - for a modern Greek symposium, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival at Worscester College in the late 1980s, I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase and the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I would have had a problem with fellow students in the adjacent room sex.
The author of A N Wilson impish explained, I would have to leave the university because I was forced to drink from a damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was bullied for one reason only - a cause that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment: my late father now Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser of Margaret Thatcher and supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to latest reports, a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar prosecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week, the same Equal Treatment Directive, the protection of gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, they are often actively isolated because of their political views, "personally attacked and declared undesirable."
They call for a place in the equal rights committee of college, to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation worsened by a recent documentary that radiates political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It was among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student union of the University of Oxford, who drove a Rolls-Royce and flaunts silver suit and silver occupied walking stick.
Other universities, conservative students say they are considered as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative Students Association of the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: " there is a growing trend of links to universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, believes such a climate is "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, President-elect of the conservative student association of Oxford says she watched with JCR, members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of its members," she says.
I was such a minority in my first weeks in Oxford.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old was reached in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university had voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student, as a result of cuts in higher education to any title.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester-week to get to know the new students and tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors mocking of Tory students not only tolerated, but even with joy took part.
Political issues such as the miners ' strike, privatisation and the rejection of the Government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa had found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In the first of these events I French texts into English from the 18th century. What should I was not taken.
"Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate" the first paragraph.
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like pie dough, and rather be horrendous.
"Refuse Thatcher loyalists to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students giggled.
Wall tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a couple of French hours in your free time, so if you are not too preoccupied with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned with hanging heads in my room.
That evening, I sat alone in the college at the dinner when someone had typed lightly on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is the way it is.
Anyone who is suspected to be a Tory.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father, Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first semester, to be a supporter of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried later to distract me.
I insisted that I was not entirely with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A university entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, as a conservative force had attended Eton College, said to me: "you are the daughter of a fascist pig".
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How Tories have sex?" One asked me.
The beating each other?
I felt so how homosexuals have felt the more liberal legislation in the United States.
I think it would ever be able to lead a normal life at the University of Oxford?
I would be able to meet only after nightfall?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me, extended song to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who was openly as a Tory, Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
It was not only hated to be a conservative, but also because he advised Thatcher in matters of foreign policy speeches and written for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and turned him down for his Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated, Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties of all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
It is something she would never do in my city of dreaming tower.
Even my communist friends presented impeccable manners.
Tarnished his moist eyes.
Give a chance.
I am sure you only teasing.
It would break my heart if you were walking.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had bowed to pressure to renounce his beliefs.
During a Tutoriums the following week, with a further serious history tutor had claimed I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly ashamed zerging, I admitted that my parents to undergo "brainwashing" and called them "old sucker."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who was the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my persecutors.
As they went, I was packing a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a whiny wimp.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was an Oxford University, which not only 14 Tory, but until now hidden behind an unearned reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

" Valentino elegance of the celebrity '
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - master of couture," which opened this week in London, speaks with ABC Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of Italian fashion.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is hosting an exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - master of couture," a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 dresses of haute couture, which were created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says, with its distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist of "il signore" Garavani but is not without its exclusive clientele could be written.
Valentino had always been a fascination for the sticky and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will continue until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the choicest aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from humble fashion-maker in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international Jetsets.
To be in love with the nobility, need not be a disadvantage.
"At least they are not tilting at your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from pop music," says Fiona, Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two in the Alps, and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"We were happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the Exfrau "Heini" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza, not forgetting the charisma of the fashion.
Many years ago, we went for a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decor, the food and the music and felt its influence.
"All the guests feel important and loved," recalls the "top Model," which began her career in the week of haute couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she says finally.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of verse, more mutual liaisons.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long catwalk, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model, and along the catwalk to admire a beautiful "audience," the masterpieces of Valentino, as the dress, Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, chose the costumes, Monica Vitti in "la Notte", or a coat made of wool and leather, the Empress Farah Diba was one example.
In the audience of fashion dolls radiate names such as Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion-maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like first love, "unforgettable."
I can remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to any other because of his great love for women, and because it highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he used; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and expression of fashion Patricia Della Giovampaola d of Arenberg can not forget when she wore a Valentino for the first time.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed to age and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in the castle of my Vetters, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying rock and draped bodice with a neck, his name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d of Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explained the Italian aristocrats, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D of Arenberg retained their evening dresses of the fashion Machers "with the utmost care" because "a dress is not just a dress, but also the memories associated with them."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion-maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to the Ivory Seidenkleid with pearls, 12 different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-metre-long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture "at the end of the 20th century," the return to the customers of the top of society.
For years, tempered with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), the highest award, Cavaliere del Lavoro Commandeur de l 'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, cumulative Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of his customers.
"I have noticed refinement, his calmness, his well-groomed and perfect exterior" D of Arenberg.
I have seen him the last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And that says a princess...

The most difficult profession in the world: human labor animals of Kawah Ijen
Four euros for the winner of the Indonesian volcano of their lives and their health at risk, if they carry a 70 kilogram of sulphur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work is hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers, who earn their living by sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano to the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It is a day to climb down on the floor of the crater, where the from the earth ausströmende sulphurous gas in contact with the air.
He has great sulphur broken stones, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths made of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 386 yards, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, and they need to keep the balance and careful steps to ensure that they do not slip and crash.
They know that each step can cost their lives as a French tourist, which crashed on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
The Kawah Ijen mine workers earn 5 cents for each kilogram of sulphur, dismantle them.
On top of the hill, they pave the path between the tourists and walk like circus monkeys with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, which has a mining company, a little below at an altitude of 1850 metres set
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (rather) is exploiting its workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for 10000 rupees (83 euro cents) in the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life, and is used for the manufacture of prank woods, fireworks articles, cosmetics, dynamite and even the bleaching of sugar.
"As we normally receive 70 kg, for every way around 46000 rupees (3.8 euros)," explains us Anto, usually three lines a day.
He needs three hours, according to which he is completely done, at the end of the day, however 138000 rupees (11.5 euros) for each track.
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wage of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day, and the average income this month of two million rupees (167), is very high," explains the winner, who had previously worked as a builder on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a village nearby, and for a reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto for three years of his life on the Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur in him the first mark, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty coughing frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here two years, because I would like to open a shop or Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This friendly and intelligent, but given the life of a young man as a tourist guide, waiters or working at the reception desk of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wood shack with other carriers, and every morning at 2.00 a.m. because of the sulphur applying at night, where his distinctive yellow color bluish shines in the darkness.
The shadow of challenging it in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money into the crater.
About 400 winners are the baskets on the crater floor with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has mechanized the sulphur reduction in order to save costs, and the agencies that work on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment.
They also receive a share of 30000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the custodians of this nature parks, together with the entry of 15000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come for the shooting of the volcano and human Tragesel.
"This work is for the animals and does not work for the people" protesting Madrusin, a sturdy, 42-year-old winner of three decades since leaving the school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to accommodate up to 110 kg and assured that he is doing, "as long as it is," because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18 years of age.
I am not going to retire, I will die here because of the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and eyes itch, when the wind suddenly and can become trapped mine workers in the thick pillars rising from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious illnesses... except, of course, the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back is Unainik with its 53 years nurmehr 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are carried by three trucks on a goat path between the bushes on the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I am not going to retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been all my life," explains Unainik, where he opens his mouth, in which some teeth are missing.
Working from his five children, the oldest man in his 30 years as a sulphur-makers.
Time passes, but the poverty keeps generation upon generation in one of the toughest jobs in the world: those who work as human load donkey on Kawah Ijen.

Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singapore to blame for the fact that they have no children, the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and the education of children.
"The population of Singapore."
I am a patriotic husband, You are my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our duty to the people and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons yet, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore, a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper's songs, the local slogans such as " is a " bao " (loaf in the oven, in order to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
Büttner Held, the advertising company that filmed the video has achieved, preserves the hope that the advert in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their national duty. "
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
The Fort plants, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that it is an issue that we had to take care of it.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with Pheromone or the organization of speed-dating evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they do not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not make something as creative as possible in order to address this problem, for example, to compose a rap?
1.2 children
This issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore.
Every year they are 1300 US dollars for political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government grants for married couples and parents up to $15000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax benefits.
But so far had little success.
Singapore is a wealthy, highly technological city-state in Southeast Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national civil authority, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was about 2 - what is known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the Singapore more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the national population, marriage and family policy authority, says that this was a "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to marry and have a family to have many more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she says.
These changes in the social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single parents and delaying marriage and births, the result is to reduce the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that led to a sharp rise in immigration to counter the reduction of the population, resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the little flowers laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese, who are criticized for low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is regarded as one of the reasons for the government party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes on foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate, the well-known impact on economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, the example shows Singapore unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments to be built.
It has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, which are known as the "shoe boxes" and are built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the life style of the single, and that they discourage construction companies to build large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the real estate firm EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes to sell" much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to make too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if the new rules could pave the way to an increase in the national birth rate is the discussions with the Singapore working in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, so it is pushed by many," says a young manager.
The kids can get.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old man.
Men and women of their career, the stress and the cost of the property and education as the reasons for this is that they have no children.

"These are very confidential secrets, my mother, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I invite beautiful images or pictures of games.
I am also distributes my time with friends.
"I would share a photo is not of me, or someone who makes a fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked, from crime to write or abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assured 35 friends in FB and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts.
I gave in to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if someone answers for me, I invite you only," he added.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak with relatives in the distance, or with friends," he states.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone suggest to a stranger he would ignore it.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager accounts into Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, Ask, he admits, 20 of the people, not to know that he has his friend list.
"It scares me because we have something in common, such as music," he admits.
After giving the boy has no hints or asked for his address or phone number.
"If someone afflicted me or asked me, I just remove it from my account," he admits.
José reported at Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation.
The boys are not unknown experience as cyber-bullying.
The friend of a friend of mine was in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim's account was not closed.
"He has made it personal."
He then explained a number of steps to configure a user account.
In contrast to this boy Jorge would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do if he is very nice to me, or I can get one over on him.
"But I know that this is cyber-bullying," he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet as a medium for the search for information, with the release of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, owner of a Masters title in education at Yale University and author of the novel "digital natives and Immigrants" these words to explain the phenomenon.
The Digital Natives are children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants are to teach them when we learn," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue, "because we want them to have a defined criteria about what should be made public or, and this is not enough in an age where the maturity."
"They should also be fussy when it is most important to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which is privacy, to ask them questions they thought.
"To tell you, they should not do not work," he says.
Porras is called after some possibilities: there are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would you, if you publish a photo of you, that you have posted by a friend?
You know what the others about you?
You have other people asked for permission, if you have pictures of celebrations labelled?
And another question: all need to know what you are doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone who is outside of the Internet with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is vital that the parents of the directives of social networks to read carefully.
If you understand all of them have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"Example, age, or what you can publish and share," he explains.
According to the Guardia the children of the lesson, "thou shalt not talk to strangers".

"South America has to learn in the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the establishment of a common state citizenship is a goal, "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans, "in the Second World War and other conflicts were killing" and "today is a country."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American state citizenship, the members countries of the Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as it is in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and to take into account those who have signed the Agreement of San Jose on human rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return we will sign the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said as a reference to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa asserted that he does not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it was time to "reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and procedures."
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which requires him to submit it to an interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence on his State territory, while the Swedish law allows this via a video conference on the Ecuadorian Embassy in London could be executed. "
Correa said that there was a danger that the health and mental condition of Assange.
"Since it is in our message, I have not spoken to him, the ambassador, however, has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not serious," said the head of Ecuador's state.
There is a danger, though, that he was mindful of physical and mental harm because he was caught in a tight space and carried no physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of every human being," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since the month of June, the granting of an open letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe. It underscored that it was in talks with London, to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, we do not apply in this case, however, there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European institutions," he said.
And "if Britain morning granted the licence, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Sweden Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogated over Skype, as allowed under Swedish law, and in other cases, the problem is.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad faith and deceit, the free expression of opinion."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom is not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists seeking profits and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself for Ecuador, no more of those journalists, "and not dominated by the bankers or hegemonic and spit bourgeois countries", and that he had "a re-election will deepen the revolution to continue on the path in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur, at least until the next elections, arguing that the body must remain "firm and no opportunism and no legal trick-State must take place," because it "destroys the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The President of Ecuador also holds the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague before the maritime State sovereignty of Nicaragua, the seerechtlichen borders with Nicaragua to negotiate between the two countries, "absolutely."
Currently, this verdict will not be implemented.
It is a problem between the South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they need to be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with comprehensively, so that we can overcome them and look to the future.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the dispute over the maritime border between Peru and Chile before the same court and said that "it is true for Latin America, call for international bodies, if both countries agree to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he, as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to achieve his third term in succession, he stated that he sees this possibility, "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa promised that if he could lose the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
I am personally has never been interested, but under certain circumstances, such as unfair in Ecuador can be corrected this socio-economic poverty of political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was the probable victory guaranteed, so I must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, then I am withdrawing from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"It has been decided," he said.
Correa also took to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had visited for a scheduled, routine treatment, and that would be expected that he could go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"In any case, it means a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
The Ecuadorian state chief in Lima on the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure a sustainable progress, equality and security.

Cause of death due to AIDS, is today a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment he received the diagnosis, the doctor tried without visible success "to weaken."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his own illness and began to inform and with such dedication that he celebrated his 43 birthday.
He is Zweifels without one of the oldest patients of HIV unit of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), in which he came after several clashes in 1994.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to conceive of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time it avoided even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt, "because it led to a dead end."
At the time AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
But still many people in the clinic, who know nothing about their illness and the virus has already caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, after the first reported cases, "the big success has come to mean that the survival of patients, the treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he said that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since 2008 concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and the life quality of the degree of impairment of the immune system of people depended on the start of treatment, and that those with more chances, which are not dependent on drugs: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years on a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above mean, who at the age of 25, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in that sense, "easily 75 years of age can be as long as it is under control," said the expert.
In order to correct this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans live an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico has reduced the number of people dying of AIDS, 6678 cases in 2007 to 4862 in 2011 (year report ONUSIDA)), it is true that since the release of the 60 percent of AIDS patients have died in the national database.
In Jalisco killed 255 people in 2011, and by the end of the month of May this year, there are 187 death cases, but assured that since 2005, universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- Why so people are still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of the drugs, the problem is that the people in an advanced state of affairs because they do not know of their infection status in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a compelling statement: "nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnoses are necessary, and all the people, where this is massive detector tests must be offered."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco state (Coesida) (Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and patients such as Fabrizio, who carried his test at a private lab for the sole reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS stage, and even the Kaposi-Sarko(), a cancer-like tumor, which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then it is better to burst three times," says, in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, sport and take the medication.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I am working a lot, I have an active, but good Sexleben, I listen to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, agreed to share their intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, to encourage those with his testimony today in the context of the global AIDS day scared.
They should make the test if they belong to the group at risk, the sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they know the diagnosis, they learn how to live as all the people of responsibility.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
"In certain places, the distribution of condoms was actually increased; previously, they were individually, now they give us to packages with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risk of people for new infections are young people.
"What do you need?" Is a widespread derision question by social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, the young people do not want to expose the correspondent.
He proposed to this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but output devices in public toilet facilities are often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether he would be distributed condoms.
"Sexuality is not enough; it is best to bring condoms to those that already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13435 cumulative cases (12158 AIDS and HIV 1317).
The nation state is in fourth place and a new cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% above the blood and peri-natal 2%.
It is estimated that 50000 people living with HIV, because there are 4 or 5 persons for every registered cases don't know it.

After the nomination court in the United States has confirmed a ruling that does not recognise the restructuring of the debt of the group of Vitro, which was a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a sinister precedent will be created for each national company with offices in the neighbouring country of payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of the company's Mexican laws in the country of the Stars and Stripes in contradiction to international agreements are not valid.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment handed down on June 15, the judge Harlin Hale on the court in Bancarrotas for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican company the confiscation of their property, helpless in the face of the other side of the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, the door to call for three inconsistencies of the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judges of the matter, indicating that the creditors are subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, says the nomination of the Fifth Circuit Court in New Orleans, first, that the main proceedings for the trade in Mexico is bankrupt.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in the procedures for payment incapacity of companies with countries outside the profile is not known.
In fact, was created for that purpose, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, the American Law Institute, was used as a mediator.
Secondly, the ruling states that without the votes of the companies after the recognition of liabilities in the bankruptcy of mass, the branches of Vitro, with its parent company, not the majority needed for the restructuring of the debt.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case was admitted to the scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by a company of the group from the Instituto Federal de National Mercantiles (Federal Institute for commercial bankruptcies).
It is also true that after the withdrawal of the voices of the branches of the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained the courts of the United States is in vitro, i.e. the vulture funds such as Capital, Aurelio Aurelio Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would have a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the court nomination.
On the other hand, there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation in 2008 in the context of the economic crisis in the United States, the blows to the country.
For this reason, puts the Gonzalez Sada family conflict before the same court nomination, so that the vote in plenary session, by all the judges, because only three of them.
Is not the Cerciorare-appeal calling for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious in this case is that the court had a document that was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura an amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the described by vitro procedure within the framework of the law on trade, bankruptcies, and noted that it is strictly to the agreement signed by both countries to meet the Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
It will also pointed out that the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade has been subject to the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border payment inability to guarantee the equal treatment of debtors and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.

Héctor " Hetin " Reyes: " basketball was my life '
The globetrotter of Basketballs, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, who was sporting a basket for more than 60 years and has traveled the world as a whole.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large collection of intellectual history of Basketballs country Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, was Rexes 6 years for part of this sport, be it as a lower-tier players, players of the first National League, an agent and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketball Association.
"My whole life I have had many hats in basketball, even more at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, main business leaders of the national team and president of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora in his own home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not with this statement.
The walls of his house are decorated with photos and memories of his long career, almost all of them.
Bayamón in heart
The emotional recollections are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros of the mid-1950s as a player in 1982, where he celebrated its 15th anniversary as Mitgeschäftsführer or business leader of the club.
" These were my best years I have enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967 as a business leader, Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer.
There were many rewarding years, including successive five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy with BSN.
From then, " Cuco " Ortiz, who was a very good manager, " said Reyes.
I know that I am Gene Bartow, who was here as a coach and worked at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: " I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
You want it? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
Bartow, recommended that the Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gauss, creep, and was one of our best shooter.
I remember he said that if Mincy a championship for Bayamon, Gauss further.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gauss was granted to him, but even from a distance, because he was already at the top of the Union in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy its executions and Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, in the fourth documented what bronze should have been, if not the Canadian referee would have been a repeat of the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
This group was the 1990 World Cup, the best national team you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those that won against the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite is the crew of the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, where we won gold and the team of the United States offered a fight as they were when they won against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps in terms of personalities, not the best, but we won a gold medal and was a great pleasure, the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won against all forecast the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this without taking account of his career in different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The boy, I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best of what you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What remains to be done to you?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower classes.
The guys in Ponce, for example, playing in only their territory and only in the national Play offs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today, the children of many unnecessary trips and games.
At least I can see the result of the required training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I like to listen to music, videos, music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." In the TV series "Dallas," where he played a ruthless, shrewd and manipulative business man.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the Ölmagnat J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" became a symbol of the greed of the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to complications of cancer, according to a press release of the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his birth city of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he loved most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Erntedankfestes.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series in Hagman when he died in hospital in Dallas, said her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him greatly.
"He was a unique person and lived life to the fullest," said Gray, in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman on television as a nice guy with the sitcom in 1965-1970 "charming Jeannie" of the NBC television channel.
There, he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden, who live in his own home.
He was also the protagonist of two comedies that were broadcast only a short time, such as The Good Life " (NBC, 1971-72) and " here We Go Again " (ABC, 1973).
To his movies were rated by the criticism of the roles in "the Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchanting despicable J.R., made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television network CBS about the Ewing clan and other figures in the surrounding area was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "who scored on J.R.?", the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure killed by Hagmann almost led to an international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
Thus the series reached an audience record in that period.
When the answer was in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, the "Dallas" in the second most popular entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, J.R.'s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had been shot.
Carter had made and threatened to portray them as prostitutes, if they are not relying upon the city, but also had other reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, greedy man with a charismatic smile: a devious business man and unfaithful husband sought to familiarise its alcohol sick wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to put on the tombstone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should read "here lies the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business that he has not won.
Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin of the original series, recalled on Friday to Hagman as an "enormous personality in and outside of the screen."
It is a memorable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers around the world and we have had the good fortune to know him and to love in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success in the television channel TNT.
The inclusion of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter has just been informed of the channel.
From Warner or TNT, there was no immediate explanation of how the loss of Hagmann in the series.
He was born in Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, the classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was a young people as they got Larry during her marriage to justice lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater in New York in the early 1950s, he served from 1952 to 1956 in the air forces in England.
There, he met the young designer Maj Axelsson, and they married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their place of residence.
2001-titled his memoir "hello by Darlin: tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I have written anything, I thought that it could harm anyone or any wise," said the Associated Press of his time.
After the liver transplant for liver donations and worked as a volunteer at a hospital, anxious patient.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them if their operations before and after that," he declared in 1996.
I would like to give them solace, such as "don't worry, it is a bit uncomfortable for the first time, but it will go well."
As he stood smoking and took part in several campaigns.

The start of the course of studying the "end of the world"
Every week, students investigate apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when the religion professor, decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long reverse counting" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not seen that this will be apocalyptic semesters, ever," said Charmé this week, students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
If someone is analysed what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he recalled that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor of this semester, which is supposed to be the last in history courses through the end of the world.
In Temple, the beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students investigate apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We will analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that hypothetical scenarios that lead to a specific human behavior.
If nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists, example, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and how they compare in comparison with real life.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," says Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history, Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara Solari, a beisitzende professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the name "the end of the world."
"We are not in 2012, so that we retain the option to re-hold the course, in the event that the world does not disappear," said Restall.
Despite the "impending doom" must create the students study projects and take part in exams.
In Penn State's final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other option but to continue working "until the night of the world supposedly comes to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no seats," said Restall of its course for students with a high average, filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of term we received e-mails from students who were asked whether still seats available.
For its part, the students that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religion mentality is just a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and health care to all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a classroom, where it will be informed," he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of the surveyed students - and even less a professor - said to believe in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Maya and discredit in a particular way," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from Westchester.
The Maya never said the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that in the Western society is an apocalyptic fear back many centuries, when the people on changes in their environment, responded with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased speculation.
"Other places, not the people," he says.
This is particularly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doug Herty, a religion professor at the University of La Salle, which this year in the Philippines, responded quickly to the question of whether he would be a course on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines is not at the end of the world," he wrote as an allusion to an exception to a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years, many days, was the last court, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people immediately think of a new date" or speculating about the December 21, the start of a seven-year period, which would be the end of the world.
Students and professors this date.
Several said that they want to go to "celebrate" the end of the world.
"Maybe I will call a few friends, so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
