The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies need to struggle against spin in the elections.
However, in the heart of бреннана believe the myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike.
The same lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for 10 years.
One can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American states are responsible for organizing the federal election in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws, insiders enjoy the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new scale after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new places in 26 states.
As a result, only for one year 2011 was taken 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 state.
New laws on elections require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyaut right voter registration in the day and take away the right to vote of citizens who have previous conviction.
Before the election, 2006, no one American state does not oblige voters to present photo identification.
Indiana became the first state, who introduced a similar requirement.
The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states.
During the last two years they initiated bills, forcing voters to produce identification with a photo, in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens do not have such universal ID, as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people, have reached the required for voting age, do not have identity cards with a photograph, issued by the government of the state of their authority.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012, do not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low income.
In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years did not have the required ID card with a photo.
But that is not all.
Students - voters, which, as it is considered, vote for candidates from the Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use photo identification issued by their academic institution.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs, who mostly vote for Republicans, the use of the voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no one state not demanded proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Starting with the 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures, apparently aimed to restrict voting immigrants from Latin America.
It is believed that two-thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, laws, uprazdnyajošiem voter registration in the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register.
This restriction was not without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped to make the lists of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall by 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.
In addition to the Republican lawmakers took in five other states, the laws aimed at reducing early voting period.
So, during the 2008 general election in Florida 33% of voters, those who voted early were -- although recent accounted for only 13 percent of the total number of voters of the state.
The same thing happened with come from Latin America.
Presenting only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24 percent of citizens who voted early.
In contrast to the White, who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters to actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws was vetirovano governors Democrats.
The most ambiguous laws was suspended in the intervention of the General Prosecutor of the United States.
This has partly to limit the negative effects.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring identification with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules, players in action, of course, the implementation of the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the 2012 election results in key states.
The report of the Center бреннана from 2011, shows that states, these laws are 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
Still too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.

Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results, lzhenegative, sometimes and lzhepositive, which lead to the sacrament medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to undergoing clinical examination, there is something hesitate even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked two experts.
The research, conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, and therefore difficult to interpret the data obtained and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, found different mortality rate among those patients who underwent screening, and those who have not passed.
The study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of metastasis at 30-40% higher than those who did not pass screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test since 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men African origin also are at an increased risk.
The key is the right decision, as the cancer was detected.
Cancer can be as aggressive, and anaemic.
Patients need to clarify the extent of his cancer risk, offering him options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many of the men, who have detected cancer, will not pass the course of treatment, as they are not aggressive cancer and poses no threat to life.
We will offer active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly we define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not be the course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still to pass the test.
But it is important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not you need to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons passing the test on the dog.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe, to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all the people were fed and quite moving, 30% of cases del RACO could have been prevented.
"if nobody smoked, this figure would be increased by at least 50%," - emphasizes Andre Beaulieu, press secretary of the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10 percent of the cases of cancer caused by its heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.
For the Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains the priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking linked to 85% of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is doing immense harm people.
"even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," says Press Secretary Andre Beaulieu.
Promising fact: ten years after refraining from smoking the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to Carr, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"research shows that regular physical activity during the entire life protects against colon cancer," - add in the association.
Nutrition
The association also recommends that limit consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities of it increases the risk of colon cancer.
It should also avoid meat products.
Conservation by smoked meat, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"the past can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," - explained in the association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists were studying the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies is not clear.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed reduced the risk of developing prostate cancer, then another gave the opposite result.
In assessing influence on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not complete clarity.
However, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor.
"the analysis does not lead to cancer."

Boson seems slightly in detail
Last summer a message about the fact that scientists may be able to discover boson seems slightly, caused a real boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains a lot of all particles in the universe, much.
In addition, is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model - our best, or, at least, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, "but that had not been able to detect experimentally.
But physics still not completely sure that it is precisely about bozone seems slightly.
We know, without a shadow of doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles boson seems slightly, predicted the standard model.
In addition, the new data, presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, although for the full confidence of some data still lacks.
Imagine all the same, that it is about bozone seems slightly, as the chances seem minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world of one law absolutely inevitable, that the two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule no opportunities, even don't try too hard, otherwise навредите themselves.
But although particle physics is quite strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which suggests that the two particles can't occupy the same space in one and the same time, if they are in one and the same "also" is a "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists share particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermionami, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
Into what a may human are else "not to as well in scurrying around at бозоны least, to date meanwhile a stark the also, and an being're safe could these place they the principle of the the that, or same thing what does it mean) times's and
Like requirements are classified bosonы says, these website, in laboratory particle Timothy, of its besides foremost], that very at the Rays, the and that will not be say there again whose, two powers teams "box. Seems slightly that. Boson are some ways a which a nature strength extend through which
Such have had could way that essences like regulations and not, very to consider emphasize to бозоны and.
In fact, if you can read this, it's thanks to one incredibly banal bozone: photonu, or "light," which is "courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle, with electrical charge, accelerates or changing direction, it "violates" electromagnetic field in this particular place, about how the stone in the pond.
From this "violations" born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing but, as photonom - and, therefore, one of бозонов "vectors force."
A more stable field
It order to that, as that what to make occurs this differences in just the or boson and is seems slightly with the bosonом and the pitch. Seems slightly, indoor rights other ") should,
However, the field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to rouse him, you need to achieve very, very high energy, as if it was a frozen pond, whose surface could move only a very large stone.
That is why a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated at CERN, the Large Hadron Collider, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies.
; weighing and бозоном explained seems slightly among of the as losses or damages good the an analogy to be and
Indeed, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others are not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all the particles interact with the field seems slightly: those that interact, have mass, while others (like a photon, by the way) don't have it.
So, what can bring "all these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon?
In the science they are used to validate the Standard Model (cm), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of the observations and forecasts.
Moreover, some of them passionately crave to such divergence found, because the slightest discrepancy may open the door for a "New Physics" and plug some holes model.
The latter, we need to say, still has significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for the gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the universe (TH-th!).
But while at CERN such disagreements have not found.
Consequences
Benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person it is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research at Bell Laboratories could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen more as a "laboratory" gadget.
Imagine...
And besides, the application can be for instruments, accompanying the study.
For example, the same williard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it does not have its original purpose, now serves as "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the LHC will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... | "debt"
The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed sensitive issue the end of life.
The debate should soon resume, and at this time is preparing a bill.
Nevertheless, in this crucial area much remains to be done.
"debt" attempted to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in monteregi.
Prostate cancer, his razrushavshii inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he said, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter palliative care Victor-gadboua in beløy, where arrived the day before.
"but it is always shock, it is impossible to prepare for," he says.
The disease does its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat on their own.
Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that helped him to eat.
He bodritsya, even manages to smile, to talk with strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, his lead in the bath.
Courage before death.
"my greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this sickness.
"in the course of life we are taught that a man must pee standing up," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the orphanage Victor-gadboua.
Regress to the child's condition - for some an unbearable humiliation.
"everything depends on the ability of a person" to accept the decline, "he says.
As, in the opinion of many people, engaged in palliative care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who arrive in palliative shelter Victor-gadboua, all suffering from cancer.
Forecasts for a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."
Ms.., 89 years old, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to learn their children.
"I have good children," she added.
"I want nothing more in life," she says, before the resolve to put her mask, developing and implementing breath.
She still awaits in the coming days last visit his son, recruited from Italy.
In the orphanage Victor-gadboua with the help of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food.
This is palliative care, which remains, when nothing more cannot be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one place in palliative care institutions.
This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.
Life goes on here in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian an - one of the doctors.
Whether comfort physical, emotional or soul.
Dying we agree to provide rotovye mouthwash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks.
We don't force more diabetics control blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we brought beer Mr. X, who died today at night.
On the morning of his son swilled down this beer in the legs of late.
"we help relatives, as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of care.
In the orphanage Victor-gadboua no one day is not similar to the previous one.
Next to the 93-year-old man, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and pereprobovasij everything to survive.
"in the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years of looking," says Dr. Christian an.
53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-gadboua, come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. to care, which is available to ease the suffering of patients, included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the orphanage.
And some institutions, such as the shelter Victor-gadboua and society palliative care at home of Montreal, are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
This is the big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors - specialist palliative care to fear the law, legalizingyuschego NGO and assistance in suicide.
Since October circulates the manifesto, signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. balfur mount and Dr. Bernard lyapuant and endorsing the their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr. Christian an, Quebec health system is effective enough to secure the right to high-quality palliative care before will be allowed the transition to euthanasia.
Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, which has spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid that patients are willing to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already were minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said to me that regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.
It is said to me that my days are numbered!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. an believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thanking nurses, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the team palliative care eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain.
According to элси Monroe, director of the palliative care in society palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to обезболиванию in 8 percent of cases.
At the end of life doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, or from time to time, or are constantly.
You cannot pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say one and the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I wish that I had assistance," it means "I want that I became easier."
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to the journalistic research grant from the Institute of Health Canada.

Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, collectors of political parties and experts on the Italian mafia day tell what they know about the colossal "system," oputyvayuschey construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
"industry," which is very expensive cost taxpayers Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"it's curious how this system breaks down after both were put in the case all the funds, joked Jacques ducheno, MP and former police chief Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011 scandal as a result of the investigation officials crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean balloon, very reluctantly agreed.
"the report ducheno" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"from the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, only one Ministry of Transport would be kept billion dollars in contracts," if some of the withheld their instincts to take share.
The commission sharboni "has already shifted its two mayors," he added, hoping that it will "open the scheme behind individuals."
The constant anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The case was created in 2011, a permanent anti-corruption unit, which entered a state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, moreover, members of the special unit "hammer" that after the 2009 forced "stochny cartel" Montreal, stop siphoning off the cost of contracts.

In addition, he admitted that illegally collected funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts, in which the victors
In Montreal "system" of corruption has worked well.
Gilles surprenan, a former engineer for civil construction, described in detail her before the commission: in the ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on the matches on hockey and bribes in a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the value of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that received the paw, zavyshaya account for 30-40% using fake add-ons.

This process she characteresaet as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and the Observer, to avoid the return of questionable practices.

Jacques ducheno notes with his hand, that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but it is especially concerned about the role of the "elected officials, who knew about this scheme," but is not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money to finance the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of the reality."
The government of Quebec offers to limit to $100 donations parties, but, he said, it does not change the situation: "while we will not strictly limit elective spending, in politics will be dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing parties: "we can't sink below; boldly true to the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."
If this story and casts a shadow over international image Quebec City and Montreal, Mr ducheno calls on those who laughs, look in their own backyard.

"PSG - FC Barcelona!"
In this season you in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary breadth.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual conscience, but it can - and a new dimension of Paris St Germain.
Great players arrived.
Beside them I m every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot of things.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I am not raspaliaius.
From the very beginning in the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF in clerfontain and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always strode forward.
Thus, you benefit from competition, Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer is not a novelty to play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training session is very important.
This leads to the fact that such a player, as I am, eager to be on the level and demand to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my position.
His deputy, such as Claude makelel, who played in the same position that I have.
Ancelotti is the master of?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect all the technical staff.
Today in the first league he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January I had with him was the conversation.
Then I wandered away from a series of injuries.
The trust, which he has me, also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season Paris St Germain?
In the first league leader Lyon took place.
But we are still at the ready.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we are trained in one eighth finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to pass as possible.
Now all can be.
We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to have the opportunity to take a return match in one-eighth finals.
Whether Paris St Germain to become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win titles and consolidate positions on the long-term perspective.
Today it is not so.
PSG have the financial means to make the project viable.
Not to take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year, we want to win this title.
Last season we were close to this.
In May, it was frustrating, because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points title suggests.
But another team, Montpellier, played more fantastic season.
This year, I think, everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that in the fight for the title became such a strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.
Don't you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troyes and we still find that totally impossible to criticize a, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what in the first place people expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with the score 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed with time.
We have proved in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has two season fails to pass a one-eighth finals, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead of the winter.
It would be a dereliction of our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new PSG.
This shows how is the first league.
I hope that in May, we can smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, and as a result we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, is completely dependent on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
And that, if they say that there is a "zlatanozavisimost."
It only means that Ibrahimovic very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to this and he proves that he is a star of the first league.
Everywhere, where he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star on a global scale.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
That he did, it is really only.
It stimulates and others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all to move forward.
As you have experienced Euro-2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I earnestly wished to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.
I have seen many things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I can play good qualifier matches.
This is something that I hoped since my baptism in blue.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well.
What do you think about the first months Didier deshama led by blue?
They advance for him.
He has a good position in the group to the World Cup.
He was a coach, he is close with the players and inspires the victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified us in euros.
I hope that Didier desham lead Blue in Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain - is a fundamental match?
This match has given us confidence in themselves.
Each fought for all.
Prior to this shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.

Bitcoin as banks "without a sell price, and
The complete opposite the current monetary exchange, based on to their central banks, numbered transactions between the parties receiving C commission fees on their treatment.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
Virtual on currencies is), Skype pseudonym very of indeed however Bitcoin and for convertible and invented by the, the, накамото Satoshi to allow BitTorrent which, exchanges type by protocol safe, and USD files EUR among,... actors) of. Levels exchange
About 200 000 operations has already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take bitkoyny for the implementation of the donations or as a payment.
The course bitkoyna, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before to return today to about ten dollars (courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing in comparison with the world of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes bitcoyne as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, as "credits" used to advance in a video game, which are made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchange).
The social network Facebook also has developed such a system.
But always exchange controls and processes of any central authority.
In bitcoyne all network nodes are simultaneously holders accounting books, auditors, securities exchange, poccupatelymi and sellers.
How is this network?
Each deal between two users actually occurs between two electronic addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction, signed by the electron, using encryption system with a double key.
The network also can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, perhaps check that bitkoyny, used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounts book, razoslanary across the network.
The stage is a new transaction in this book.
She passes through the mathematical tasks, razoslanary computers, decided that, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege add this new line.
It is about hashing phase of the file, you have a large file in the digital signature, a short and unique.
Machines favour хэшировать "all the 'have along". That as the to her rooms, is autoactivity, the new
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros in the early).
Once this number found, other sites easily check that it properly.
Transaction thus turns nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user with the aim of deception very quickly (less than ten minutes) would be willing to pay twice as one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other remained unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, who had begun the task, receives 50 bitkoinov.
To avoid inflation, the award is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitkoinov in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one stomillional that leaves another reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The network has already experienced ups and downs.
Provisions's was stolen bitkoyny attack, were Bitcoin services, spells that pages

The ECB also said about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also have the disadvantage.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their permit.
Recently Adi Shamir and дорит Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed Ledger book and found that nearly 80% bitkoinov are not in circulation.

We have gone from Afghanistan.
What next?
Etc. Surobi - каписа of Afghanistan a responsibility their the have the
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only on us.
The US suffered mainly Afghan farmers, which we regard as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and pokalechennymi.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but also often of peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by the jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They fail, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer, as only the West will behave more delicately.
Withdrawal of French troops from bases Nijrab, which I watched from a Hill plantation almond trees thanks to the French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, not being attacked by.
With the end of 2014, the invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood from the struggle between the various factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women paid for bigotry of these peasants, in which surpassed their al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved, and in our days.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in dependence position.
The main characters anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants who returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontracts.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, not even fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that would not consisted of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed the American generosity: capital outflow is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the general population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who don't want to go back to the old mrakobesion parties, no to corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap opera, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment the army is there.
The government, which will be to her commander, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders overland ways anti-Soviet struggle, is already taking measures to restore the provincial guards who would not abide by central authorities.
Afghanistan, mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be up to a certain extent decentralizovan, modeled on the western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai wants foreign control, particularly before the elections, scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, starting with the 50-s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
Industrial system has some fees ирригационная функціонує is the dam has no is neither has renovated, has. Toes on
All imported; produced nothing, except vegetables and fruits.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control over infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
This only heightened the feeling that Western countries were there, only to grab them.
Without energy for iron ore processing or copper on the spot, without means of transport to their export through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese already almost left the field of copper months айнак, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig into a huge Buddhist complex and remain the major employers province.
Also, you need to one day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: vocational school for girls, for boys, the faculty of the French language in the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in striving to "win the hearts and minds" and meet the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, "civil-military activities" under the Ministry of Defense (cimic), this ATR company was abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive involvement of local labor, could help to contain the uprising: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, restoring forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and increase the area of arable land.
We leave that to the memory of themselves, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget has promoted would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2 000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy of provinces it local community of the has acquired каписа dozen. Which arises operations agricultural performing smallholder to writings by
To get rid of uprisings, governed by foreign groups, which want farmers, as they talked to me, you need to give them a small involved support, which would be controlled by a well and came to him directly.

Heavy deliveries of the constitution in Egypt
It is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play Va-Bank.
Surprising everyone by surprise, he announced Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on a final text on the next day.
Exactly one week ago, the head of the state Assembly has provided two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to the legal conflicts.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic" delirium, continuing to violate the word "and" violated the right. "
In his camp followers believe that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon the intention to explain to Egyptians text, the article after article.
For the president it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians vote positively, as he said in an interview the U.S. time.
The more that call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "or you are voting for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers," which, as it is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling is not in a position to convey his opinion.
Representatives of the human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare, participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the brothers-Muslims.
It is no wonder that in most cases of articles were progolosovana unanimously.
Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements arose around... the time for prayer, because some members of the committee decided that the constituent assembly were improperly configured.
The text, which yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object spotlight, Article 2 eventually remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, quibble with that, "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would give the possibility of their more strict application.
For Islamists to the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect to other members of the Egyptian society.
"the hypocrisy," - meet the liberals, who see in this only PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the constitution is through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar advisory role, in particular, that comes to verify compliance with sharia laws.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pomi, it is alarming to. "people to take decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of a theocracy. "
Many liberals, moreover, excited the fact that the next rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.
"at the moment there are no particular religious interventions.
With this constitution we remain under civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on the text, is not Ulema, and people with a university education, some were in the French system "- calms Alexis blo, which is preparing thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around Article 220 may arise ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, - Ed.].
And in the future may be the question of how civilian judges are competent, to pass judgment on this. "
Apart from its religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the Republic.
Muslim Brotherhood argue that they have decreased compared to those which have been under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.
Also not be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern over the text, which they believe detrimental for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth prohibited insult that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are no longer talking about protecting women, emphasizes chaeba moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in the article 36.
The word, which does not appear in the constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to play yesterday evening on television, protests are planned today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will come out on to the streets on Saturday.

"the Great and Powerful" to Moscow over: migrants will save money on language
While the deputies and human rights activists argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing in the country have already emerged fraudsters, "fake" certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million migrant workers.
For the most part it's citizens in Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families, remaining at home.
From December 1, the law came into force, according to which each migrant labor will be obliged to take an exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
As long as this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, life and retail trade.
Over time, however, the promise in the Federal Migration Service, "the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
To have not only the language, but the Russian history, and the basic law.
Knowledge of the language will confirm and to see, and to extend work permits.
The exception is valid only for the citizens of the countries where English is the official language.
Do not fall under the law and the people who have worked to get certificates and diplomas on education before the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, downfall and the protection of the rights of the
The network will work under the auspices of the Institute of Russian language Pushkin, the peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; now in Russia have opened more than 160 such centres.
The initiative supported testing and the deputies of the State Duma, and the Federal Migration Service.
And here's human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times had to ask the question: what it is, in fact, give?
That will change that knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the visitors?
First and foremost, "meet the representatives of the migration service," it will reduce the number of people suffering from "labor slavery."
Very many say now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of Russia's Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan Victor sebelev.
Protection of their rights should start before their departure.
Only the system set up to 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems appear migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, I am sure sebelev, - the future migrant is doomed to face unfair people who under the guise of helping vsunut him "putyovka" in a spooky close Barak, where he and dozens of him will be months without food and documents, induced by 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"at home they promise one thing, but on arrival they deceive, select passport, do not pay salaries promised," - the head of the main labor migration management Ms Tajikistan толиб Sharipov.
Not rugaisha, nasyalnika!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, recognised that not only do not know the language of the country in which seek, but on their own they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much of their wine, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even primary education.
Because their families had nothing to feed children, not to mention that got them to wear, shoes and computer simply by transferring to the school.
Dorastaya to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if poorly with knowledge of the language, "they admit.
"you feel humiliated and incomplete."
However, in respect of the law on the language of human rights defenders say one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status - will not be exam, no further official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of workers still live in Russia illegally.
"welcome, or no entrance"
Many of the newcomers say that to get an official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is the bureaucratic препонах and all those same language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization is money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here's false registration can be done quickly and all for one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, and hence the cases of extortion.
"asking for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," - shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan oumed hushkadamov.
"налетай, do not grudge dispensing appropriate, buy painting"
In the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it emerged that false are not only the documents for registration.
Several "sham" certificates of the language tests have already seized by the FMS.
Fake paper printed on a color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, надеявшихся thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than two times more expensive procedures testing official: it will cost Labour lotion in three thousand.
The fact that the main challenge in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, to "brown" cannot be simply buy, and representatives of the authorities, and human rights defenders.
So far, the authorities can promise guest workers, not managed successfully testing the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with the people.

The Interior Ministry does not take the turnover of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons extremely small
Russia's Interior Ministry offers to tighten the law in respect of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities on the recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when without victims, and Slaughter, a Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, in which seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the wearing traumatics in public places and to raise the age from which you can get a license for the weapon - from 18 to 21 years.
An idea supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and counter-corruption Irina Yarovaya, and promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons will contribute to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
In an open letter, which the authors - representatives of various public organizations - require to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of muggings with the registered weapons minimal, told BBC Russian Service lawyer-Forensic Suite Vasily forest rangers.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Interior, for six months of 2012 142 crimes committed with firearms, registered in the bodies of internal affairs, while just over the same period recorded Poland thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter are sure that tightening legislation in the field of civil weapons not puts offender to go on "black" market.
Now, they say, in Moscow can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry said that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to military officers
"the black market weapons on several channels.
Five major such channels, said the retired Colonel Victor Baranets, ten years who worked in the Ministry of Education and the joint.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is "an army or military footprint," i.e. weapons that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"arms pulled and Russian officers, and Caucasians themselves," says Baranets.
The next type of "black" weapons stolen criminals from representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that includes and gone from police warehouses, and stolen from law enforcement officers directly.
Illegal "barrels" go on sale from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often there were explosions.
"there are proven version of that part of the arson attacks were made specifically to cover shortage," says a former military.
Their contribution, according to Baranec, making weapons manufacturers.
"now get divorced private arms factories, which do not maintain competition in the international market and throw away the weapons from under the floors on the black market, including in Moscow," - the expert says.
Another source of "black" market - smuggling.
Especially many pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"there are its production, sometimes primitive, and the mafia, which organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where weapons?
Experts thought, what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market. "
The report about this in 2011, has prepared the troubled analysis and public-managerial design.
Experts analyzed reporting the Interior Ministry and the Rosstat, criminologicheskaya literature and open data portals on the Armory.
The overwhelming majority of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "to the fault of officials, whose work is connected with the weapon," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases weapons come from places of armed conflicts, 14% of the cases occur theft on the stage production of weapons, 5% to "black archaeology."
The seller-consultant of one gun shops, who asked not to give his surname, assures that the weapons, found black copateliais, long ago nobody buys is too old.
More often than not, as he says, for the new party sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through the Ensign man buys unit, for example.
He discharged her, pass through the fence.
"he carries it in the city and sells here for 900 euros apiece with two shops," he says
"the truth is, the police in the course of all cases, so periodically when burning plan for solving crimes, control purchases from merchants illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"as in the luxurious shop"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through acquaintances.
I did a column on the Web sites, blogs, until comrade, who offered to come to the platform "racing," where is the person who top me in the corner, "where we will bargain.
The price of the trunk I learned only there
Military observer Viktor Baranets
To get the barrel I need a familiar, in which there is a way out, "says the seller-consultant." I have a friend there, but I'm not in it.
The sellers in the markets, but there is also need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter tooth out."
I am now even a couple of subjects took out through the man, in which I am sure.
He also their supplies only to me, because he knows that I don't rent it.
Newcomers are looking for different ways.
A former military Victor Baranets tried himself in the role of buyer's illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
Scheme, he said, have not changed.
He gave the album with photographs, where it was "anything."
"I felt like in the luxurious" store, "recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranec, do not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not simply buy - we went with the seller in the forest, it set the target.
"give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am assured that weapons beats well, begin to bargain," - the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
The search engines in the Internet sites and groups in VKontakte, which offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
It does not need any documents and personal meetings.
"it is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising cap on the site "to buy a gun or machine."
It users leave their applications and asking questions.
But minors sell?
"without a license," of course, "asks the user" Ivan "(sic).
"buy tt.moskva" - tersely formulates the request "fedorenkov."
Federal security service now razbrosila a huge network of sites and willing to buy the weapons is rowing by a shovel.
People go hungry fish on prykormku, and then coal mined in Siberia
Military observer and a former military Victor Baranets
I heard about such schemes: usually the site registered outside the Russian laws.
People accept orders.
The buyer through the ATM produces payment.
"in response to send a photo and instruction, where hidden weapons," said Press Secretary of the public organization "right on weapons" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets argues that leaving the application on the site, you can remain without weapons and to get behind bars.
Federal security service now razbrosila a huge network of sites and willing to buy the weapons is rowing by a shovel.
"people go, like a hungry fish on prykormku, then mined coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, can meet the $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry kislova of the "right to weapons," the pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Wait a month and a half.
He is shipped from warehouses long-term storage of these warehouses middle managers.
According to the official stastistice agencies, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia fell by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousands, and the number of identified facts of theft and extortion weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell 7.8%.

In the US on fast-food outlets and supermarkets
Through the work at the box office "McDonald's" goes up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages in department stores Corporation Walmart and restaurants popular fast-food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, "" Wendys "and" Kentucky Fraid chicken. "
So far, no one is predicting whether this wave in the ninth shaft or her destined to expire in the early stages.
The shares trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
In addition to a modest wage increase, which receive ordinary workers Walmart and fast-food system, the aim of the protests is the creation of the trade union organizations.
Until this sector of the economy almost no trade union movement.
46 cents in the year?
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America has fallen orgy of cheap sales, annexed millions of citizens and sometimes accompanied by Mina Zayed port authority.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, in which around the world work 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and пикетировали along with trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is counted on modest and middle-class people.
Walmart has everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores in an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage workers Walmart come only at work.
The availability and variety of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods cheap partly because that little pays its workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, for example, the shortage of workers or hand-held scanners.
The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Average employee Walmart, supress 9.5 dollars per hour, this is not too expensive for consumption, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart среднуюю salary will increase to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost corporations in 3.2 billion dollars.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart scandalously high number wage growth entirely on the shoulders buyers, every visit to the shop will do them all at 46 cents more expensive.
For the year they will spend on something 12.2 dollars more than now.
Supporters of the Walmart quite noted that protests have occurred in nine states and caused no damage maleyshchego Corporation.
"black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of its cash machines produced in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
A representative of the corporation Deng Fogelman argued in an interview with the left the site Huffington Post that jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was just a "another intact gimmick" slaughtering its trade union.
"free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and therefore there is no), and "McDonald'ses" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even gives you the hospital and not paying you for a job fair!
Jumein Williams, a member of the New York City Council
At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is dollars per hour.
Fast-food restaurants with time it improves, but not much, and in the middle of their rank-and-file workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
Less them in this expensive city not earns no one.
How can exist in New York on such money, for me it is inconceivable.
When something through "McDonald'ses" was almost a quarter of American teens who podrabatyvali for their mysteriously after school, living with the parents.
Few who saw the main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I'm constantly on interviews with workers "macdonaldsov," who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children.
On the other hand, on the forum Wall Street Journal newspaper hangs a comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to get children, if you don't know what you are going to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and restarant fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, then there is more than doubled their current minimum salary.
They also demanded that the fast-food industry were established trade union organizations.
American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement was harassed and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life.
But to reach Union fast food and difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main - unusual turnover.
Holdouts
Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the Day rally at the McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council jumein Williams, insisted: "McDonald's," says that he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even gives you the hospital and not paying you for an honest job!. "
Demonstrators have supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for the post of mayor Bill de Blasio, insisted that "we must all join in support of fast-food workers with the fact that they have achieved fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every new-yorkets!."
As the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But it took only a few hundred people, though not all of them were quick catering workers, in which New York employs tens of thousands of people.
While it is unclear whether this will spark the flames mass movement.

"as long as the fool the brain"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality lately taken to perceive mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, in the summer, at its annual conference the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that the application for a patent filed and Microsoft.
However, from the conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D technology in cambridzhsk laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi should be that for scientists this company points - passed the stage.
Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
"tell me, please, in general terms, what does your research group?
"we are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While you're at the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes please finger in them.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no one today without the Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because all the interesting vestovoe management.
- what else awaits us ahead?
"despite the fact that Kinect suffered interaction at the physical level, things are still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information has improved the system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.
We're trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective.
You need to release computer world in our physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality!
"what do you think about voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate whether her?
"it is definitely not a panacea - comes the question of privacy, because they don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
Actually all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places have been the project, in which we thought of gestures, but not over, and over such stingy, short.
The gestures were not camera devices, and naręcznym bracelet, which registered the movement of the bones and muscles.
While he is great, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of the wrist watches.
But the future of the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.
"it's like?
- for example, as you ask me to give you this bank for the pizza?
You say, and at the same time show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- that is, you want to make users adapt to the fact that may or may not at the moment the machine?
"absolutely not necessarily, but it is the mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more accurately determine human reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give permission for depth, it is very important.
"if we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you have claims to modern cameras?
Lacks depth, or something else?
"in principle, the current generation is something from which you can start in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels speed of 1,000 to / from.
But it's not in the megapixelons themselves, and as the matrix and depth.
With the latest point of view all current technologies for us good enough - it adds designers algorithms.
That is, we must remember not only about the resolution on axes X and Y, and z.
It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen betishes from our redmondsk laboratory made sensor touch with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, and modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.
Not all understand how it affects the interaction between people and machines.
I would in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, not only requires kasanions to frames per second was more.
"and the number of cameras to increase does not need?
- the Kinect now have three cameras, one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second is reflected signal receiver.
And here is already the third luggage is, in fact, the usual sensor visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or aggravate it, increasing the amount of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible similar to Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the provisions.
"as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public their glasses.
You don't think that from the point of view of everyday use technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
"of course, the slob around all the time, holding a smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the steep option would have been" synchronization "reality when, on the basis of the cloud platform you could switch from points on your smartphone, projection display and then everywhere.
Points are very personal device, in this their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time, the weakness is the reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects together with other people.
"imagine for a minute that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark of" Iron Man, "but the mere mortal.
There is one problem, which often show critics such an idea: no tactile feedback!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers your group prepares to this challenge?
- in his lectures I often say that the reality is the seventh of a breakthrough in the cooperation between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be additive tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a substrate for image.
She registers clicking!
But there is technology, which is aimed at giving this "images in the air" Hafner - for example, several of the Rays in a certain point where the finger, gives a sense of, but until it is very weak - as if you blew on the pads.
And there are bracelets on the wrist, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction.
"and you are trying to trick the brain?
To make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something?
"this is a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.
Here is another task, which is to fight for a long time - how to make human, physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - and we are working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not, such as in the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While the brain is secondary, work is still very for many years.
That's what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive for researcher - many things in its infancy.

Вкусовщина instead of culture - rosbalt.r
"Rosbalt" continues the project "avant-garde" dedicated to the townspeople, who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
In the top-list have already entered the bright figures of art-scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national fame.
The new hero "rosbalta" - GORGOROTH artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man dressed in red, which meets the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the fashionable parties and vernissages.
Cyril Miller's paintings always gather crowds, where they would not exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the only St. Petersburg socio-philosophical сказочников, the creators of the new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, the appearance of their smile on the streets calling for citizens, with the mood.
Complex in grain ripened as a, so sharmanshchikom his the role of Petersburg to the шарманку and is he took arms image. Philosophy of, and богемным to his
- Cyril, and why do you still go through the city in the red, but not in the yellow or turquoise, for example?
"I chose the red color as a designer who view and image.
In this world of red color is a compromise between the artist, image-maker for and society.
Although all in society, that a little bit not grey, causes aggression and excitement malign properties.
But my provocations aimed at ensuring that started the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative shares - an invitation to debate.
"and when you realized that there should be an artist?
"the exhibition at the Hermitage, where were exhibited my work.
I realized that this is my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists, and the new, free like me were unintelligible.
I became a friendship with a new wave of artists, with postgaznevschina, which led to the "Pushkin-10," and more waves was not.
Throws me in the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except for the words.
"and it all has to come together in your art-clinic... - for me it was important to find yourself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative force.
In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there was not yet repair, there was a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, House of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: nomy, tequila-jazz, I remember, as cord led with the project "ear Van Gogh."
Cord and his friends sang under the veneer light songs, they were in obtyagivayuschem tights, among them was fashionable now composer Igor vdovin.
When the group alive, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was leading many programs to Hale-galivskikh times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went his great career, and basic education and upbringing he received from us.
The gallery "D 137," club "грибоедов is echoes from the art-clinic.
Our employees and habitués are gone.
I hero yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "the people of our city."
In the nomination "artist of the year" was named, I ended my climaxes.
In the new times on the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"your work is recognizable manner.
"many of my paintings are hits, they expressed the urgency and sharpness.
I will be software exhibition, "the Russian Museum in clownah."
Clowns - timeless category.
I once was, now to be so it is painful and scary.
But in clownah all spread, tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have гротесковые ideas.
) the procedure приказном opulent by the totalitarianism save of the world like
Now on clothes, based on foreign mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand and with a spit.
And deception will be removed with the help of dressing.
And recently we saw you in the role of the city at the organ-grinder. - the cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, like me, they are not to be.
- may well and commercial art can be beautiful?
"now commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet.
Disintegration cultures.
Different that простаки loved a and and of the pack into pressed in people past
Now all crashed on microsoobshchestva, now difficult to enjoy it all.
I'm not one hundred dollar paper, to all the time.
Now need to think, who will be pleased.
Now each cult hero for 100 fans.
"but the Stas Namin Mikhailova comes to a few thousand!
- on him come brochenki, there sexo-social sphere.
And on cultural grounds of 300 people will come, and 10 thousand not come, and ultimately less management, money, all languishes.
I have fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil unfair.
I wrote in his youth such paintings that one collector they on the wall next to the Falc and Larionov hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confuse.
They say: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, is from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew by examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing paintings.
I'm for such a culture.
Kirill is that not enough?
"good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: an official from the culture.
But not every one of them can do culture.
When the right tsars, Kings, can't really understood the culture, but they understand that you need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg there, which could be experts, but they are pushed, as need higher experts who correctly appreciate these experts and give them the road.
Now thrives vkusovshchinka.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art, we accept there are artists who should look for other museums.
- what is for you - St. Petersburg?
"St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital of culture in Moscow, much more, there is the soil.
And on our stones art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, and we have writers now more than readers, it is wrong.
Here in Europe very many people lyubopytstvujuchyh. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer subtle.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.

Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with an asteroid collision-killer.
Caravans ships with землянами aboard go looking for spare the planet.
To save humanity, the question arises, how to continue their race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact, only two of these planets, which can develop at least hypothetically.
"it's Venus and Mars," said senior researcher at the state Astronomical Institute Sternberg (гаиш) Vladimir surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live at a high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
Even a half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations grown in orbit peas are no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - in orbit insects, tiny fruit flies-humbled.
In conditions develop in of an embryo, as перепелок check cosmos egg was a 1979 year's gravity
We get on the output is absolutely normal shape.
And here's the problem begins.
"the problem associated with the fact that this nestling must find support, he should get back on their feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical-biological problems (imbp) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir sychev.
Not finding support, chicks randomly rolled around.
And after 10 hours of the newborn was full of atrophy instincts.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that through four days they just died.
"and the two times we vyluplyali chicks, after it refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them," - the failure of an experiment with Birds in Space Vladimir sychev.
With animals last biological "minikovcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However, at biosputnik "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
Was an experiment with mice that were sent into space since the fruit.
In principle, there is not found nothing supernatural.
"it's just been on biosputnikah, but again, it is an experiment, and such research should hold," said Vladimir sychev.
After landing at the space rats appeared offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space until it turns out.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing habitat, simply can't realize their sexual instinct.
The same man, in contrast to the work load, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create opportune emotional background.
On ethical grounds such experiments are not carried out.
But women in space travel 50 years already.
The biggest risk was Valentina Tereshkova.
And the most precious, that have the humanity, is a woman's body.
Our Seagull flew, and no one on earth could not say whether he after a flight into space.
Whether she will be able to give birth to a child after the flight.
"on this question no one answered," says veteran rocket-space industry Vakhtang vachnadz.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child andriyan Nikolayev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana savitsk, twice in orbit and even elaboration in outer space, son was born.
But the risk remains.
We have little, there are cosmonauts units, which have after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation.
"and if more, then it is dangerous even when the orbital flights," - summarizes the pilot-astronaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity is necessary to look for something new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity.
Named as chief RD department) CPC is mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in the conditions of zero buoyancy astronauts are honed skills in outer space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults, let the water and comfortable, but still alien environment, for infants - native element.
Small ichthyandra confirm - life on land out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months mother in okoplodnaya fluid, it is easier to get used to the then водичке.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, is only 2 weeks.
"this is very little to forget something," says the instructor grudnichkovogo diving Marina Aksyonov.
In short, if a child born to weightlessness more natural state, it is necessary for women - gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness dryachleyut the abdomen, pelvis, falls to the ability to expel the fetus.
Okay, skip it, relying on stimulants generic activities.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, chasing it.
"and then what?" asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.
Not feeling of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscular system.
Newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special Schenck costume for training.
He simply will be deprived of the fact that he will be vital.
"and this experiment, to which we are with you go, assuming the birth of a child in the alien environment, will lead to the fact that we bring to the ground with a disability, fully disadaptirovannogo man," "forecasts, the head of the Committee on bioethics imbp Ras Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space - the question of theory.
However, after the time it will be a reality, when earthlings on their ships will go on a faraway planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.

The head of the department of management: Schwartz-checking system failed on the fault of politicians.
In the field of government procurement Czech Republic has good control and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the supreme security department of management, of the interview for the site aktualně.cz.
"the law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough," - commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices lead Peter nechasa approach to the so-called Schwartz-system.
Recently, the prime minister said that the GFC (Civic Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs checks - it is prohibited or allowed?
"the law should be somehow, and if it is something prohibits, the Prime Minister could not resist the institutions, which are required to verify and to seek commitments," - stated Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies you talked about the joint project between the Czech and German parties, within which correspond to the legislation on procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
A parallel check, which we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, the question that European law argues, how should be public procurement, the national legislation and then also the use of the practice.
All the information was collected and, even when the still unfinished, revealed the interesting differences - simply put, the legislation we can be "accurate and unmistakable," but in practice we on certain parameters behind Germany.
It follows from this that is not enough to create more and more detailed rules, should focus on the application of the law.
And as this project can help you, that he means to you?
Such joint control can contribute in efforts to stop the law, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve this, reducing restriction orders.
Perhaps this system переполнится "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if not limit declined.
You talk about internal problems practical application of legislation on procurement.
As a control system in Germany?
Is there a organization such as our KRU (security-revisional management) or it works differently?
As an in our which bundesrechnungshof, has our as an A in in are one facilities well as and as are both organizations largely are., however a little differently board that is
In addition, the authority to a certain extent are similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of audit and on the level of federal lands - in this system somewhat different from our own.
Brh can manage only federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal chambers.
As for local legislation, there is easier than we have?
In general, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but you can't definitely say that it is better in all.
It is so, because they are better cope with control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But I must say that even the main countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected on the establishment of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it is not in our control.
As we have control of the fact, you need to consider some of the delay.
Take it into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we started to use our new tool "risk detection uneconomnosti," through which we beg almost 14,000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope he is.
The problem, which may arise, is that the rules "uzhestochatsya" and it will be impossible to observe.
Under the previous rules controlled enterprises intertwined with the supplier (for example, Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in this case to harden the law in this way?
I think that is not in this way.
The system should exclude those who wants to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit formal mistake, not influencing the decision.
Such a system only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path will lead nowhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that it will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called Schwartz-system. What does it mean?
"Schwartz-system" is prohibited or permitted?
The law should be somehow, and if it is something prohibits, the Prime Minister could not resist the authorities, who are required to verify and to seek commitments.
You can say: "we're going this law and solve it," but you cannot say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains fairly strict rules, how and what should be done, and it is right. This protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only due to the formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough.

Shimon ornest: at the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than one month should come the end of the world?
This is just one of the many disturbing news, on which we, the people, so easily popadaemsya.
Together with a group of the tap tap we constantly kidding on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy, to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concert against the end of the world.
Could you tell us about the readers?
It is about national fundraising event, which we are now within two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, which declared an end on December 21 at 11: 10.
The day before the event, on December 20-21: 00 parallel start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They are exhausted, roughly speaking, the moment when, on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific time zone, which for 12 hours earlier than we have completed may calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all think up together with our artist gonz аугустой.
In addition, that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want the public to reflect on the state of the world once we send our children.
By, these air ports irrevocably years of, that Mark original the end of the ключиков footwear may against your calendar late the subjects collection a, we into to give the, and over the world we: options tap.cz these. Www.e as site buy a is a stuff
The group tap tap tap, together with other musicians also sang the national anthem against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
Whether it will already fancied by listeners YouTube anthem on these living proof of his virtuosity concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything and the end of the world will not come.
All the performers on all the concerts at the same time.
Hymns simultaneously ring also broadcast live by Czech television.
The words to the song he wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomas ганак, participates in the performance of also xindl X...
As you started to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other persons Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.
Actively try to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, it is interesting.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
The purchase of equipment for bezbarriernogo educational center studeo, already the sixth year so we are working with the civil association tap in edlichki Institute.
Teachers regularly attend school students of the Institute of edlichki and spend with them funny and interesting events.
The students have no money to go to the teachers, and thus we try to give them the opportunity.
The project of building additional edlichki Institute in the future will be a separate building, in which we переедем with this project.
At every concert will perform several musical groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We tried to make the program, which will all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Barth, the Tap Tap, Marjan банго and Jiri Sukhi.
About all the details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "grandiose events" in the future?
In May, will be the first to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group tap tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their strollers should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
But international airlines ČSA Britain, discussed an airline company license no problem with that nonetheless British from the other hand airlines enquiring for and I always feel surprise how many time I have say, splendid we can be always
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to participate in such races abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes towards disabled people, and so on.
With what you have to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London, and other countries, where all the works better than we have in Russia, we have witnessed that the East is still on a basic level.
Compared with the Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and here is still in the new independent human movement on the electric wheelchair in the heart of the city.
There are also not in the course of the banal things, such as give way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there are already public organizations, who are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, we must constantly to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance which far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation is always depends on the efforts of those people, whom it regards.
In London and Madrid quite normal that people with severe form of disability independently moving on the streets, can go to the toilet, the museum, yes anywhere...
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, and in this we tap tap a little ahead!
Public respect or bezbarriereness is one thing, but at the moment, when we will be among the well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really start to change.
As long as this isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The group tap tap tap currently is very popular, but let's get back to two years ago, that in 1998 you made her to organize?
I entered the institute edlichki as teacher, around me was a lot of young people who wanted something to do.
And since I am a musician and play the saxophone, together with a colleague has organized an interesting music circle.
Well, and with time, says our leading Ladia angelovich, it is a little bit out of control (laughs).
Popularity came only in the last few years, I or something?
It is true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the group's propaganda.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, essentially as if there is no.
Thanks to the European Union, we can afford to qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Whether the goal stood before you so well turn the tap tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, podrazhayuschey one another.
This is logical, all new accepted with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, sorry, it is naturally...
But this pity izlishnya completely, because people with disabilities are not affected and all abandoned individuals, whom we should pity.
They are people who can live full lives and develop, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if the people with disabilities, it turns out, this shift not only for them, but for the whole of society.
Whether the success of the fact that you are a strong leader, you see how many?
If we want to do the work, we should be in many things hardcore and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that this is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when learning that twice a week they should go to rehearsals, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently in the group of the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them was in the beginning in 1998?
Only one Ladia angelovich.
We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and the will power, our doors are always open.
He held the day before the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague Incheba at the stadium, in Brno and Ostrava fléda - in the centre of plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
, "carpark the tap teams of time for телемостом after of are woven everything City's live is countered 3" of
The goal of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for purchasing multifunctional bezbarriernogo equipment for educational center studeo edlichki Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert is worth 400 kroner, for children up to 12 years of free entrance tickets can be bought in advance in bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full-fledged member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA in 1994, and within the next years took an active part in a number of projects agency.
But the path to the space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it's not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, and lectures. Sternfeldâ, which on December 6, 1933 represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "introduction to космонавтику."
Ideas of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934, France Sternfeld won the prize Robert esno-peltrated and Andre Luis hirsca for "introduction to космонавтику."
Dr. Jan gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, and later became a great promoter of astronomy and space.
He has published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books, devoted to the scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became known worldwide promoter of space, and his contribution was assessed in including the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway drezina, equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear, even to disperse or to pull carts had to be used by a rocket.
Information about this drezina known only from the newspapers of the era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about missile missiles.
The research section of weapons in cooperation with professors mieczyslav wolfk and Gustav mokzhitsky.
Of the remaining material shows that studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the advent of German troops were interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press had the idea of missile-fighter, which offered rogozinsky engineer, and next year work "air-missile torpedo and missile-bomb" author Leliv-kzhivoblotskogo.
Both projects were developed for military use missile engines.
Before the war all projects military use missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of its activity ended work from the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954, the magazine "problems" in which published four articles on Astronautical.
In one of them professor m. Subotovich offered to organize society, which will be cosmonauticals.
At the time, already gaining momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (поа) attempted to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and already in autumn поа became its full member.
And in the next year, the first chairman of the поа Kazimierz zarankevich (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this position he remained until his death, which happened in 1959.
Since 1956 поа contributed to the development of the highly successful meteorological rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, vpolnivshei scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently was built the enhanced version of RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on bledovsk survive tests were conducted two-stage rockets RM-2.
This was a rocket at length about 1.4 M, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the rise in the wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
Heiress first missiles RM became a meteor-1 rocket, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.
The rocket was conceived as stage, its total length was 51 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
The three were developed type (marked as a meteor-1A, -1v and -1s), which were the size of cameras for scientific equipment.
The rocket meteor-1A had space of 0.4 L, meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and meteor-1C - 0,62l.
The maximum range of flight from all three types of was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 years in the Aviation Institute of development of missile meteor-2, and her first flight tests began in October 1970.
The rocket meteor-2 with the initial weight 380 kg was able to bring valuable cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then there were built version of the meteor-2n and meteor-3.
It should also mention the accession of Poland in коспар (Committee on Space Research) in 1960, and establishing a national committee коспар two years later.
In addition, in the framework of the intercosmos, Poland participated in the research space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav germashevsky became the second intercosmonautom after Vladimir Kiev.

Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decision provoked lively debate in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issues with the broader point of view.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that separate economic units, national economic system, are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation.
As a result, a significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) price tension arises.
Under this concept you need to understand the state, when the producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to survive in the economic competition that the "misleading" cost competitor to pick up a large part of the market and, thus, to increase their own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where the cost of labor, compared with other high.
Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including for unemployment, the rising costs of the state on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of employers to pay taxes, and thereby to compensate for the economic and social damage, the harm them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that does not need to be specific statistical data.
Besceremona methods of private capital are at the level of the economies of individual states situation, when governments are forced to engage in competition with each other to artificially reduce social level of its population to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the government's own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected in the changes in the legislation.
The goal is to get its people diktat of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor law.
As a result of the rising level of poverty, and together with the and the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there is public distribution of food to the poor who are not in a position to feed themselves their own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching one million.
In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occurring cases, when employed people get a salary that the state should resort to them, so they got subsistence.
A similar scandal became known to the public, and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same state, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic fall of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist for instance salary on the margins of society, in the hope that someday in the country come private investment capital.
But asked where he will undertake?
If the capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the European share of wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not management actions to interfere in the economy.
Then you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now practically managing policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?
A definitive answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of the Almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, poised in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that public ministry due to lack of funds require bills private law firms, which are tightly linked to the industry.
Then these bills argues the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution, and from the financial-powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a situation, as described in Appian work "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "the state has long been disintegrating, and agencies involved in violence.
Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the elections with pre-sold voice... "" decent people are not at all of them to the position of the ruler, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul ".." seriously started to talk about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic man ".. Appian thought that it will be Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy on autocracy.
As in antiquity, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without public interests.
Private capital has already essentially not intended for use in the public purposes.
The result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.
The cause of the fascist and communist regimes, we must look for reckless economic systems liberalization in the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of the type of liberal democracy can be seen as a pause, after which is expected to be the next tour.
First of all, it is a tragedy that the current elite ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and the new history.
Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
Thus this trend is systemic in nature.
The solution are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share participation of the state in the economy, and strengthen the role of citizens in the management of state and weaken monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory chaos.
"nothing will come out of the violence, and never can go" - the sting, the song "fragile," where the main verse рефрена are the words: "don't forget what we fragile."
"if my sons did not want war, they would not have been" moribund La goutelle Schnaper, wife Meer amshela Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused a lot of responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, genocide, perfect over the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of killings - the offender and the victim, who, in the end, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, to see who primarily serve going 95 years already tension (from signing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning supported by historical facts, some of them on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people take their own steps, or for their throne was someone who has guided their actions to the pre-set goals.
We should admit that we live in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and power out of them could not happen for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be considered as head octopus (I don't know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
Many of them do not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 90-s 19th century, to stop rumors linking their name with criminal actions in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and who have always led to strengthen their power, improving wealth or both, and to another.
They are large stakes in almost all of the world's central banks, and against the countries, in whose central banks they do not have their share, they lead or prepare war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government has committed his country's central bank in their hands.)
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for rothschildowski Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (ponymay - government money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to cancel Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after both wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 year led to the development of the plan three world wars, the great Mason 33-level Albert Pike.
The task of the first war has been the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and the third should lead to the reduction of the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism may not be nothing, except as a prerequisite for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power.
Method, in which the working group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (AB Chao - order out of chaos.)
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war by killing Habsburg heir to Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended a sudden, grounded in the warrior and economically surrender of Germany (already had no need of the war for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the launching of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations, rather than a precondition to radicalization impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans a strong enough, oblicayuschego guilty and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played function fifth column, fueling the fire of war.
In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration has created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, began to be the first clash with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, it is hard to evaluate whether Hitler pulled from the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or all that he did, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish state the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as Germany was triggered by the military reparations on the 2nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a third war.
If international bankers will unleash the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will become a victim of fighting on the front lines, now, together with the Arab or, simply put, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp divide people on the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections only their own candidates.

In light of the manifest words now, said David Rockefeller in 1994: "all we need is the general crisis, and people will take the new world order."
The new world order in their view is the World Masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy, naslajdayuscheisha comfort.
World, where everyone born body at birth implanting chip, with whom he becomes a under a total control.

The film "operation" Argo ": when worse than nowhere, draw Hollywood
In November 1979, demonstrators crowd of Islamist students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza's shrine Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which were patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration the positive outcome of the situation was not - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence allies in other countries.
However, the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of theocratic regime, she was not in the state.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was intensified by the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate has caused a wave of solidarity and antiiranski sentiment.
The defeat in Iran largely contributed to defeat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election ended, Ronald Reagan's election.
The film, srezhessirovanny actor Ben Affleck "operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.
After they finished their way into the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, and this has helped an extravagant legend cover, according to which they went to Canadian 2002 as members of the crew, podyskivavshie in the country a place for filming science-fiction epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented expert "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation in Hollywood.
To the legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film аффлека is a particular combination of several genres.
Since, history, kinoopus one to be a called 'so by of,, and a realistic Kill Bill: a political оушена and the movie case a set of you may accused of is
In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from Tehran (in the caption shown significant historical events and the way the same situation were demonstrated in the film - big differences in this no).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, the overlapping with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then the scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables in the stairways institutions, on the phone...
Рестарт career expectation is Affleck chestworks yet
From vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"operation" Argo "his third feature film, after dark detective" bye, baby, Goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" The Town "(2010).
At the same time, this is the first movie аффлека, who remains in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of atmosphere in this refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.
And this is Affleck in "Argo," where Tehran "plays Canada."
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and непредвиденности, which arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.
Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes fictional (fake headquarters on the Tehran Bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a variety of exciting scenes cinematic values.
He it there -- додумывает quite a goes well't operates as something with a are tastefully this (rather, and sometimes toward Tehran and the an airport to the stage the precursor by, the impending, the in the meeting of which-the phone landing the call remove it immediately in America]. Farfetched looks quite
The lack of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, but they are not the only ones in the film.
Film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this film, which you can watch with the moderate interest, evaluating and retro-style, recreating 1970s thrillers.
But with difficulty.
However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence, as exaggerated notions about Almighty and vseznayuchyh intelligence.

The rules of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, conducts an annual survey of the most absurd bank fees, now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd decision or the project from EU workshop."
"we made it to the last event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of major European companies," said "law" organizer questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among the already nominated the nomination absurdities - the recent decision by the European court on the insurance contribution rates for men and women.
Until now, women had privileges on life insurance, because insurance companies they are less prone to risk.
"further incredible ideas from the EU's workshop people can advance the competition until the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.
The controversial EU directives include, for example, and the obligatory adding Centrum Konferencji i Rekreacji Sp in fuel, that as a result of the harmful nature, as well as a ban on the use of mercury gradusnikov only because they contain relatively small amounts of Hazardous Substances Directive, or about the size of cages for chickens, which this year significantly tightened eggs.
Also criticized was de facto ban on the use of the term "buterbrodnoye butter" or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.
Pan-European apparatus often makes the decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose position in Brussels is usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under the threat of veto defends the requirements of its banks).
The lobby interests are: for example, the highest quality bananas in the EU were supposed to reach 14 cm in length and did not dare to show "unusual curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the that only harmonizes existing piecemeal national rules that trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, all same softened standards concerning the fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive will lead to rastochenia products.
Candidate to win in the survey can be, and last year's resolution of the EU, according to which sold balloons should be warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU appealed to American research, in accordance with which the balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation.
That restriction now applies to children up to 14 years, which prohibited to blow in the trade fair dudelki.
Fun ideas are born and at home
Enough is absurd and rule regarding the European officials: everyone who has the EU any official position, can not, given the sensitivity themes for Greece, to use the name Macedonia, and should instead talk "FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of non-interference" (laissez-faire), offered to vote, in addition to the above mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU's rule about the amount of food supplies on the territory of the membership of the state.
The EU set the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
The Czech Republic has exceeded, for example, established by the volume of canned mushrooms, for what she faced a big fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in the idea of pay and some countries for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to statement about getting subsidies.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, and not in Brussels.
"we are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.
The European Union will ask for compensation, "- said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument he pointed out that the country was high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying the state was full of warehouses, that it was necessary to remove.
In he would паласу, according to the things pay, us, what hundreds of the Czech Republic mln located the euro on means.
In the end, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, arranging a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages the Ministry of Regional Development, India minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: bizarre orders are the exception
Although the resolution in the member states can easily become the object of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as more effective operation and Development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is cherpanie EU subsidies for projects that are not even hint at something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved when discussing the budget.
Emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians have retained the name "olomoucki cheeses," but "tuzemsky rum," which tradition in our country roots in the 19th century, our producers should have been to rename the "thusemak."
Rum can be called only products from cane distillate, not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with famous cheeses "feta" and "gorgondzola," marcipanom from German Luebeck or пармской Ham, has already proved, for example, the Karlovy Vary breadcrumbs, pogorzelitsky and teresebonsky carp and jatetsky hops.
The trademark of the EU can be proud of pardubitsky carrot and gorrzyckie tubes.

People want to I guarded Republic, but I am an amateur, "says окамура.
Mr. senator, as a person comes in the head to run for president?
I don't think about how to become a senator or president.
If we have everything in the country function without problems, then I would not anywhere was running.
But I can no longer look like for the last 20 years the country разворовывается, as here by thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I have not had ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then trying to find a solution, as it is to change.
And because I have already turned forty years and I am an independent man, not related to any party, I have no other way to influence things, except to run for the post of senator or president.
In the Senate, but soon went to the presidential palace.
Do you turn in such a way back to the people who you choose?
I told all the time that vklyuchus in the struggle for the presidential Castle, depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.
Later I said that if I selected the senator, it will run for the presidency.
My goal is not the post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
So I have the greatest influence and vast powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation ropschem himself in a bar or TV, but willing to trample on everyone who tries to change something.
Added to this media, which human ochernyayut, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, I was told that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri paroubeka.
Move on to your views.
The fight for the presidential Castle you started with a thesis about material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the property declarations on the amount above twenty million.
In order to do it, we need to change the law.
You have as a president such authority, and only the Senate can offer laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied to conducting excursions became free enterprise, it managed to advance.
It, Sprava and the a supply from the lies to come on djukella someone once, политиканстве громадян "restrains is, against a, barriers
As an independent bespartisanogo person I have far greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party raskladyvaniya Heymans has, without looking at the tenets can take each party that is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left?
With the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to the left.
For me it is not important at all - a bit to the left or a little to the right.
For me it is important that we go forward.
It is not about the fact that someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I always support any good for society, the decision whether to offer his hrcm or GDP, and I will be the same against bad ideas.
You are angry when someone says that you populist.
But do not prove whether you is the fact that you say?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have the ideal goals and views.
And you are trying to get closer to it.
You can call it populism, but all proposals, of which I am already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.
But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics you don't hold for long.
Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk with them, then you will be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other options.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them on their side, that we have achieved their.
If I was elected president, there would be problems to organize direct TV broadcasting, in which I will appeal to the chairmen parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to inform, why don't want this.
If there is a strong personality, which outline abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of public pressure.
I say directly that I am an amateur, and not a genius, and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I'm just a beginner in politics, and for his program will try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, after six years of close and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as if окамура should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that one I didn't do, so I visited a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to radzim yanchur, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
I also at least supported the leading investigative journalist Jan lorentsov, which opened fraud with light fuel oil.
I put forward his candidacy because that people really are dissatisfied with, but now I feel myself on the street.
Sixty percent of the people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose representatives of the establishment.
Us independent in the Senate only two.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, direct elections for mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of their own party?
I haven't thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I have no money on it.
There is no money and in the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You have no money?
You're talking about the property declarations, but how is your own affairs with this?
Personal property estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth approximately 25 million apartment on a 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, the collection of works of art by approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Skoda has a million, and even a few million on the account.
Aston-Martin I have appeared, because it was my malchishechya dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove the car, was a charmer of women and at the same time have fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive at Aston-Martin, own property on 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money to invest in this do not want.
It is not very convincing.
I have no 15-million on the campaign.
I must get into debt?
In the campaign I already invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, suggests that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
Spending on the campaign I essentially cover senatorskaya salary.
But for the money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English School, which is 30 thousand a month.
If I wanted only to earn money, so they would not ran.
That means you'll continue doing business, to be live?
Do you not said that reduce this activity?
But this does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I reduced its activities in part.
For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like, that I was bessrebrennikom, which will keep the Republic.
But I also need something to live.
How, as an entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting a month?
From 200 to four hundred thousand that receive and further.
And if I became president, his business would be finished.
The full interview, you will find in the issue of the newspaper "right."

Szabo: "the Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the U.S. position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical towards Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on a forbidden zone for flights.
In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is.
The thing is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, by the U.S., to the German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans agreed there is no common policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.
I believe that as long as they only with its role, but are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain.
What specific means "normal" foreign policy with the German point of view?
This willingness to borrow in their national interests, not from the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, i.e. from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests largely differ from the interests of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend their interests.
Whether these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf states.
So it should be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not give it too much importance, it is not completely one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Навредила voting solution, such as a concerning decision if from refraining, the Germany Palestinian their own relationships.
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of the German position.
So I don't think that this was the same dramatic nadlom, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will thus a certain respect.
It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., by contrast, clearly voted for a veto.
Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
The force of the American domestic politics such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation, of course, the government can't openly to hold such a position.
I believe that significant differences in opinion is not so significant, as it always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama not delighted from Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the most important partner in the EU with another?
I think it makes such a difficult situation for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not so.
So they can't play in the broader approach and forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
This is the way they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will assume a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that it would not be easy for Germany, though because of ties with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not whether she will take on a major role?
Or a leading role still difficult given Germany?
Germany is not used to this, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still is always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany assumes the role, are the most various German feelings.
The Germans are not just deal with it.
Actually, it is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view of Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account the different neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the U.S. influence in European politics is weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is?
The Germans will have to play a more significant role.
Even if you don't like or dislike to you - that's life!

"the protection of trademarks in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is the world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what the Armani polo?
This is officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names would be charged a lawsuit.
But then, and it is unclear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"it is increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas pattloh, the company's lawyer Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights violations in the trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new kind of case.
Imitators enough add a couple of letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada instead you can register a Prada-kny.
The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma.
Pattloh opens the folder with records of the agency's trademark registration in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered trade mark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, in which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the world champions copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is known.
In large cities have multi-storey department stores, selling almost exclusively of forgery.
However, no such pattloha on behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from the agency's trademark right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban minpay," Mark-passenger.
It is associated with the word "ban dakuan."
So called women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
"this is detrimental to the business, with the need to fight," - convinced pattloh.
"trade mark collars, a unique position is lost, the image is very much suffering."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third largest and the fastest growing market for luxury goods.
But to achieve removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court rejected the claims, as at the end of a long time oprotestovannoe name became "a reality of the market."
If the complainant not lucky, he will have to pay even plugiator, as the damaged the its sales in China, says pattloh.
Sometimes it is ruled by the law of jungle.
There is also the famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009, the company Daimler lost a court dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer SANY, Enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired Goker manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star.
Afilias Limited announced Volvo company Geely originally used blue-and-white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste lost in China imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.
Chinese authorities did not consider himself guilty.
The registration of trademarks ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010, due to a lack of personnel and equipment there had been difficulties.
But in the last year, "the return of the emergency situation in the working process to normal."
So, the amount of untreated cases objections decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed almost properties already completed such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in the office.
To deal with this is expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million complaints about protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record, and means that China in the tenth consecutive headed the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the agency.
The same goes for the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011, was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees.
If not, it means that each registration costs an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Her appeal is worth many times more, as the case of the German family company plant.
For more than seven years of struggle against Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to achieve that illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been defeated.
However, the simulator has cemented a Chinese rights to trade mark plant.
It was their own omission, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, "says Leta wentzler, chairman of the board of the plant chemical hillside in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks ctmo rejected the claim münchentsev.
However, in both instances plant won, but adverse party continues to struggle so far.
You need to be alert
The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good finish and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be accounting firms archive had to view even acts of a century ago, to lead the evidence.
Five years ago, plant in vain proposed adverse side of the "great shestiznachnaya amount in Euro" for the settlement.
"it is clear how expensive it is to us," says wentzler.
Danger of Far East threaten to spread even in Europe.
And just in case, if imitation register there for an unprotected trademarks.
So, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name of the plant for footwear and leather.
The company has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration.
"you need to be alert," says wentzler.
As he and a lawyer pattloh recommend German enterprises be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather than foreigners should be "all that somehow is worth defending, also in China," says wentzler.
Otherwise it can do much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed: if the plant loses in the last act of his drama about a sign, it will have to pay any adverse side of the licensing fees for its own name, explains wentzler.
Otherwise we will push the market in the dark segment.

World AIDS Day: prithoptyvat, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg rehearsing choir imbonga - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans.
The history of relations, overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers.
First, stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' pumps and men's slippers select tact on parqueting floor and quickly find it.
Once-two-three-four.
Only after that slowly develop voice singers - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano - they occur, enchant and follow each other.
And fit Hopf, 29-year-old conductor, almost stumbled out of their shoes, when their flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, the Music Hall of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg imbonga choir rehearsing a new song.
The rehearsal came Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from specialisti on human genetics to Porter.
"om" obani "is not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, the same on a prima facie alien language: zulusskoye, on which they say eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of the Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on AIDS in the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected people.
23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa.
In Swaziland has 245 000 AIDS orphans.
The more than 40 percent of the population of HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of eSitjeni Association voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend school, gotovyaschaya to further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in the Gogo-center.
Imbonga on zulusskoye language means the narrator or voskhvalitel.
In this room don't speak fluently on Bantu, but know how to sing.
About brings even lower from time to time and languages ten their a it years back for the there разучивает. African - South first appeared it, where
At a distance of 8733 kilometers from the summer, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland is eSitjeni village, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent of infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus.
In eSitjeni in miniature reflected the disease only Swaziland: the highest levels of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which proved reduces the risk of infection, almost half the population is not accepted.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's population are the human immunodeficiency virus, the death in the middle of the fourth a dozen is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants imbogni saw many children in the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but just: food, clothing, education.
School without a man in a poor country there is no chance at all.
At first it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send your child to school and give him an opportunity once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later, the choir founded the Association "voices for Africa," which has since almost professional care for AIDS orphans in eSitjeni.
The facts about sexually transmitted infections,
What are the most important, sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STDs syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (гонорею).
Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human spreading papillomas-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Lobkovy pediculosis and scabies belong to the Labour STIs.
What are the main porajaemye group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between the men.
The heterosexual adults often seen sexually transmitted diseases, are chlamydial infection, trichomoniaz, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human virus spreading papillomas.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among the youth chlamydial infection are significantly more often than among other groups.
According to the data, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people also often meets human spreading papillomas-virus.
As the number of cases of infection?
Not all, sexually transmitted diseases, subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms indicate has a sexually transmitted disease?
When infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, with complaints мочеиспускании, selection, the pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as the bubbles or sealing.
But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
As part of the bacteria, sexually transmitted diseases, can also spread through contact infection and in close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners.
With early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote consequences.
Patronage, donations and not the least fees for choir throughout Germany allow something to gather.
"we just sent in eSitjeni already about 200 000 euros," says Annet Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany manages tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She also cares about how to orphans were well-arranged, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as called on zulusskoye old women, it is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to yourself up to 14 orphans, give them shelter and care about the children in the form of every day time appeared on the lessons.
Those who do not have relatives, go to the shelter to haniysil, lonely woman, who receive salaries from the association, as well as two поварихи, which each day preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association "voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built two henhouse and jointly with the American Health Organization PSI organized surrender analysis for HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is evident throughout the country, prefer to keep silent.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," - says Annet Lennartz, "because it is connected with sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the King has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch black Africa, King мсвати III, known for his love for the excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such an unauthorized state life-style also lays blame for the fact that the virus has spread so quickly in the past years.
But it is also the stray workers, which carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, Annet Lennartz says, "but they almost do not use.
Another culture - the flesh to flesh. "
A little bit to support cultural exchange, the choir ibmogni every two to three years, making a trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the black continent know since the apartheid era.
The bus, full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened, provoked tears in the eyes of the border guards.
The trip also always leads in eSitjeni, where singers visit sponsored children.
Despite the fact that the little village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the Valley of the river etsulveni it more than known.
"go to eSitjeni, light there," - say the people here.
And after 8733-km-long flight back in Heidelberg, when topajošiem singers returned in a room on the street bergheimer, you can see that this light burns also here.

Messenger: NASA opens up the ice on Mercury
"the probe messenger" found evidence that the planet Mercury is the ice.
The ice sheet can have the thickness of up to 20 meters.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located close to the sun, there is also the frozen water, as is evident from the three studies, published Thursday in the journal Science.
"the probe messenger" found evidence that constantly located in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes with a comet or asteroid collision with.
Nobody connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, "said Supervisor Sean Solomon of the probe.
The temperature on the mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other building elements of life in other places in the solar system.
For the inhabitants of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they sent to Earth images: small windows in the endless gave.
The image comes from the camera, which developed the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which turns around the sun for Neptune, Ceres, on a new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment infrared Spitzer telescope is "family Portrait" countless generations of stars: the old stars in the form of a blue points, it is more difficult to identify in a star circle of pink "newborn" stars.

This iridescent fever dying star photographed NASA's Spitzer telescope. "
Similar to the doughnut ring consists of material, which the star threw in the process of dying.
The giant nebula Trifid, remote on the 5400 light-years from Earth, from gas and dust are the new stars.
NASA's Spitzer telescope made this photo galactic maternity Hall.
Star in the constellation, also called the "Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope colors are better.
As the red eye winks observer nebula snail on this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
The similarity with the continent has brought this nebula nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides eloquent color rendition.
This new star in the whole beauty managed to photograph only with the help of infrared sensors Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they have is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps this pieces of the moon Saturn, which disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: Galaxy maelstrom
Depending on the color images spiral galaxies turn into real art works.
Published by the European Southern Observatory photo shows the remote to a few thousand light years Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius horoscope.
Trifid name comes from the Latin word trifidus (trechdolny, trekhrazdeling), as the dark dust is divided into three parts of the heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation of змееносца astronomers photographed a harbinger of cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth kernel two merging galaxies towards each other and will inevitably face.
This is the birth of stars of the Hubble telescope took off in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical reduction, may call it nicknamed "southern tsevocally wheel."
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the nebula in the constellation of Iris cepey.
Nebula, remote 1,400 light-years, is composed of particles of dust, the size of which from ten to 100 times less than that of the regular home dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote at 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called ARP 273 photographed for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
A spiral galaxy scientists call was UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the brightest new stars of our Milky Way.
Stellar cradle of constantly creates new stars.
This starry cloud, coupled with nebulas socket, also creates new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly illuminated galaxy with a small black hole there is no dust, gas only.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans lipperosgeem - before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the Mirror optical telescopes became more - and their view of space available deeper.

The mirror, shown here, has a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, a "big binocularising telescope."
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Grand Prix telescopio Canarias" has a giant inner workings - diameter mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The Mirror "big South African telescope" in South Africa segmentirovano - for the sake of reducing the cost of.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches approximately eleven meters.
The lack of affordable constructive performance: the Telescope tightly seal under vertical angle - it limits his mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-eberli" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His feature: high svetosobirayushchaya ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror - parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.

In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to install the European "very large telescope."
Its main mirror should raskynutsya by as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should be expected until 2018.

February 2, 2011, NASA reported that i.e. 1,235 candidate planets have been detected since the start of the mission.
The photos feature the latest cooking space telescope Kepler. "
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space before 2018 aboard rocket Ariane 5. "
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of a telescope: he must in light of the first stars and galaxies to seek a big explosion.
The scientists suggest that at the South Pole Mercury is the ice.
But there is no reliable data on this, so as a "messenger" moves closer to the north pole of planet.
Radar measurements over the decades pointed out that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to running in 2004 zondu "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists now sure.

The search in the country where 97-year old seem still relatively young.
In the Southern Azerbaijan many residents are biblically respectable age.
Even here, there is the museum of longevity.
The search in the country where 97-year old seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talish Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
Minibus with tearing rumbling rolls on the winding road past overgrown dense forests of hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
All around the green and bright, that you might think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak in Farsi and azerbaizhdanskom and longevity.
The end point is leric.
A small town flaunts too heavy Soviet-era architecture, which does not guarantee with beautiful mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost don't come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too utomitelna.
On 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one lane.
Dynamically without is, a province in fact, wealth добралось in. This, of oil Caspian is it that
But Pilate фатулаева (48) is convinced that there is interest in leric than tourists.
"in May, Baku famous festival Eurovision song contest - and the next year, we will be the oldest people in the world," says фатулаева.
She is director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here documented biography about eight dozen-speaking Talyshs from these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to the black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
In the age of 136 years he had another child was born
But disputed the star of the museum is the Chaban shirali mueslyumov, which allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificate, however, no.
And given the fact that the oldest man, whose age is confirmed by documents, was 122 years, age mueslyumov is extremely doubtful.
"he was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," - explains фатулаева.
The man was married three times, and he was 23 of the child, in the age of 136 years he allegedly was born the daughter.
So whether added Chaban mueslyumov a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt solc, researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about dolgozhitels in Central Asia.
"a lot of elderly people can be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Valley in Pakistan," says, "solc in Sardinia also lives a lot of very old people."
However, due to the lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no civil status registers.
Every day the glass baked butter
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the district lerica shockingly often reach biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years.
Why here in the South, so many livers?
Azerbaijani guide Farid mugimzad explains this special-speaking Talyshs genes.
The director of the museum фатулаева, on the contrary, believes that the case in nutrition.
Talysh like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them drink on stakanu baked oil every day, but it is unlikely that such высококалорийная diet can be healthy with dietologicaskaya point of view.
Or in primitive lifestyle, which keeps people youth in chengamiran, tiny village near the town of leric, lives rubaba Mirzoev.
In the 97 years she still relatively young for these latitudes.
, which claims that it had 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly talks back and forth.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Mirzayev, which have long been already have their grandchildren.
Also near the two children.
Guests in the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in the typical pot-bellied armudu.
The Mirzayev perfectly aligned and sturdy white teeth, under the handkerchief she hides long dark-blond one spit that her son proudly opens before us.
I always my hair milk, so that they never slip and saved the color.
"and I never used shampoo," says.
Monthly pensions enough for life
She always ate only that grew in the yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I have never bought products in the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the Army.
It was only after the second world war.
But it has become better, when the "father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of the old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, which rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son, Ilham.
Nevertheless, among Azerbaijani old no poverty.
230 manats (roughly the same amount of euros) receives a monthly pension for local conditions is the amount on which you can live well.
And, perhaps, long grew up the son of Mirzayev rights, too: "old people in our culture are deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by the care and are happy.
No reason to stay alive as long as possible

The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo suggest a deep rift in the country.
The future of the Constitution, based on sharia, met fierce resistance.
Egyptian president had the pathos.
We must create a transition.
"and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was requested to all the people, but the first to Christian coptm, liberals, enlightened Muslims and irreligious Egyptians.
After all, they are all still hopelessly fragmented opposition in November, are experiencing fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer, has a doctorate at the University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and around the world.
Will force the judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles managed to smuggle in a 15-hour jump with obstacles on the Islamic Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly concerns.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the judiciary is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But that means "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and fear that Islamists will use blurred the formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for more strict Sharia law.
At least, it hints at one novovvedyonnaya article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, should attract for the Council of the University of al-Ashar, critical of the country's Islamist institution, great authority in Sunni Islam.
It should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversight legislation that de-facto would be the consequence of the judiciary.
The draft constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: should remain venue civilians military court.
These courts in the period of Mubarak's served for the suppression of the opposition.
After the overthrow of dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family," and "to maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is so vague that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control the content of the film and literature.
Open Text, this means not that other, as censorship.
No one article did not directly equality of men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording that prohibited "insulting people."
Whether enough will be cartoons on the president or jokes about правоведа?
The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians on the referendum.
"revolution"
Already several weeks formed the opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unanimity Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force.
"the revolution has returned, and we'll win," - said Hamdin Sabbahi, which took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohammed ElBaradei said that the draft constitution place "on the scrapheap of history."
Through the short news Twitter he accused Morsi's supporters in the desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"if he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and skinem it," said Yasser said.
"we are still not tired, the blood of our brothers still not otmzena," - the media quoted the Egyptian opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that does not want to observe the referendum, which would have made it invalid.
"the Koran is our constitution"
Well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for demonstrations, but out of precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters, who shouted: "the people of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "очисти country!" and assured: "the Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, where it all began, triggered the state of civil war.
Morsi's followers, quite obviously, did not want to go to this risk.
Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution was loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Most of the project for the Islamists, is considered to be resolved.
"the notion of" human rights "not mentioned never"
Hafiz Abu Sayeda in fury from the constitutional process, which was supposed to last February, with the participation of all social forces.
48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (eopr) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when Mubarak they sat in jail or warlike before the court.
Not because that he shared their worldview, but because that human rights for him are inviolable.
For this he was beaten, jailed, was arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in a new constitution, he regrets in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi's expanding influence on all three branches of power in the state attorney is disappointing.
These measures represent a clear attacks on democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"instead of to strengthen civil state, president of the de-facto annulled it," - regrets Sayeda.
Because without civil organizations democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that all left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This can occur for granted.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "you are creating a monster, which will not be able to control."

The Norwegian racfisc: the most badly smelling fish in the world?
The population of typhus Norway is one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the whole world.
Perhaps the secret of success of this country somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely zlovonary fish dish?
Take a few perezrevshih pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there on the week.
You can smell the odor othschibayuschiy racfisca - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered marveling. It is very beautiful, but in the air razlit neistrebimiy distinctive smell.
Racfisc is Trout, posypannaya salt and brodivshaya in water up to a year, depending on what exactly Dushka need to achieve.
As twilight and kholodaet, crowd the Norwegians are going to the festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this, let's say, exciting dish.
"her eating a raw and are served with strong alcoholic drinks a glass akvavit, local tminnaya vodka," - explains хавард halvarsen, local fire by profession and "General" racfiscovy, who runs the festival.
All around us people eat presliced small cubes fish and its scale of meals are served with strong alcoholic drinks alcohol.
"someone more like Akwawit than racfisc," - says хавард.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If will be able to carry a piece of the nose, then all is not so bad - differs little from serving sushi, which you Long was driven to a bus.
Racfisc is Norwegian product from other times, the Times of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn zamachivali in sealed closed barrels with salt water.
Then deep in winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly zabrodila, her removed, and prigłuszyv perception of alcohol consumed in food.
Still on the memory of the last generation of the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants, which involve jobs here, high salaries and a well-developed social welfare system.
Residents of Sweden (longtime rival, and still not so long ago and far more wealthy neighbor) come here to work.
Racfisc is seen as an important symbol, is indispensable, though a few smelling element of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here are all the expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you at 9 pounds sterling ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the News of the world, and most of the inhabitants of the country it seems satisfied.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and extremist right-wing, in the past year rasstrelavshego and killing 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, called the attack "happened on July 22."
Norwegiam very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their compatriots was capable of such atrocities and killings.
The basis of today's well-being is Norway (growth since the early 1970s, one of the major oil and gas industries in the world.
"however, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, разносящая trays with Hogg rakfiscom, a woman with long blond hair and blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare.
We the people - as you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We do not like to show we are not khvastlives.
Norway is very carefully drawn from its oil is a big part of the income in the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund, created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the world financial crisis, when all sorili money, which they have not been, Norway economical podschityvala all costs.
"as long as you can go skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer, enough for happiness," says Anna.
"and there are racfisc", "she adds with a laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for something food - racfisca with me enough.
Here's a burger with Losin meat is certainly something exotic, delicious creamy meat.
But the evening awaits us more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel hold a special dinner, dedicated racfisc, during which the visitors vote determine the best or, perhaps, the most you fish.
We can either give Direct, which show a lead in the tie-butterfly, surrounded by plates with rakfiscom.
It is like the song contest "Eurovision."
"so, Tor-Jurgen, what you set for the best fish there himself in the mountains?"
"yes, хавард, here is our assessment of the...."
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falling from her chair, perhaps provision akvavit.
And maybe, just nadyshavshis smell the fish.

Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start career.
While Mexico's president-elect, Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join in the post, BBC correspondent will grant invites us to look at the difficulties, with whom he will have to face, and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Traffic in Mexico City is now in tatters.
This city is overloaded transport and in the best time, and Monday were erected steel barrier, pererezavshie several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to not give people to get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protests to get to the parliament building.
On Sunday the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto wear the presidential shoulder belt and take the reins country.
Before him is not an easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic indicators when Felipe Calderón's administration, which now stacks its powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has already claimed some 60,000 lives.
"my government says Mexico's people about their readiness to deal with violence," - said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to suggest a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Such statements to the next president of the United States political career, Mr Peña Nieto has evolved as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and extensive state surrounding the capital city of the country, opinions about the new leader are divided.
Outspoken man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about it fondly remembered.
Residents put him in merit tourism revival, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
You can get to the city on one of the new highway, built by Mr. Peña Nieto, who are very different from the roads and Yam, who were previously on this site.
Plates with his name on the modern building sports center and on an impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate change.
"we associate with him hope for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally Gabrielle Olvera Hernandez, Congressman state led by Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change, which are so badly needed our country, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 continuous tenure PRI party has been supplanted in the year 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year-old absence in the presidential palace Los-пинос party has high hopes for, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refuted charges бессодержательности, who put forward the new president of the opposition.
He is very прямолинеен and very devoted to the realization of the vision of the future of the country.
This is a great statesman, and, above all, the man knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
Nesahualcoyotl municipality, also known under the name of Ciudad corporates, poses the most stark contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under estacadami highways, he in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are too severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, for the pacification of gangs, selling drugs in these areas, troops were involved; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
To survive the vast landfill only for the last two years, was found dozens of bodies of women killed.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City in the province of Mr. Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar measure in the notorious proslavivshemsya violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name, when it comes to murder innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, about him in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as governor he failed to cope with the problem of the killing of women.
In the worst case, his administration has been accused of ignoring the problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this area nationals, Buendia with difficulty is holding back tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter Marian moon.
According to the official version of the Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
Сожитель kill she that the says this families yet
"when I got to her home, it seems that her body before this washed," recalled Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that her beaten, and the body has already okochenelo.
The mother Marian tells this story, and a portrait of his daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion, on which a just one word: Justice.
This, they said, was denied this family.
"state officials appealed to me as an old splentitsei, upset narushitelnica peace.
They want people to simply accept on faith that they say, and the pomalkivali.
But it is wrong, so you can't, especially when so many irregularities and shortcomings, "she says.
Wearing a presidential shoulder belt on Saturday, president of Peña Nieto, together with her assume responsibility.
For the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected the crimes associated with violence, and the new president promised to make the solution to this problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same president, what was governor," says Olvera, Congressman from the Valle de Bravo PRI.
However, this most fear families of victims in Ciudad corporates.

Bradley Manning on not complained of mistreatment, the indictment said.
Prosecutors are trying to refute statements Bradley Manning about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing special attention was paid to stay Manning in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning were brutal.
The US Army private accused in the kidnapping of several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that private Bradley Manning on, accused of the largest leak classified materials in the history of the United States, not to take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint to the mistreatment, which, in his words, he had to move, being in the military prison.
During cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort postings, Maryland, the military prosecutor Maj. эшден Fein said that record weekly visits Manning the representatives of the prison administration for the first nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain allegations of mistreatment.
Under cross-examination of the asylum protection to stop Manning on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held on the next day after Manning on said that in custody, he intended to commit suicide.
A military expert analysis of intelligence data, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused in the kidnapping of several thousand secret documents during the service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was Manning on.
During the hearing Friday attorney Fein together with Manning looked at the reports, which were filled with after visits Manning administration officials during his stay in prison Quantico, where he was on a strict regime of imprisonment from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison employees asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor Fein asked Friday about the reports, Manning on acknowledged that assesses the appeal to himself with the prison administration as "excellent," and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
Reviewed reports contain no complaints of mistreatment, despite the fact that Manning asked directly about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning on replied that he expressed concern about these problems, and that the visiting his administration officials discussed with him these problems and have stated that they will, but not documented this in writing.
"they recorded" no problems "(after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the issue in a conversation," says Manning on.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning, why not complained of ill-treatment with him in January 2011, during a meeting of the commission, rassmatrivavshey suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for a few months before.
Manning on said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve, so it was stripped of its regime "prevention of injury" and softened the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited detention regime - to a level lower than the supervisory regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, but also for the sake of the security of others.
"I wanted to give the administration know that with me everything is in order, so they canceled the regime prevention... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," said Manning on.
On Thursday, Manning on testified about his arrest in Iraq and translation in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months, before transferred to the prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had thought about suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness from the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically very hard, when you don't know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"my world betrayals to base camp-arifzhan, to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
"I thought that I will die in this cage."
While in Quantico, Manning on, he said, spent much of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hour, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude.
Manning on reports that he was allowed to leave only mattress, blanket, slippers, a few items of clothes and sunglasses.
He says that trying to move, so as to sleep or even just lie in the daytime banned from the rules.
According to Manning, during sleep in the eye him constantly beat the light coming from the outside camera.
If the guards did not see his face, when he perevorachivalsya in bed at night, then, in his words, his arousing and forced to turn back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to the unlawful treatment with Manning in January 2011.
During. With the Kansas ливенворт in Fort detention at military on translated 2010 April, Manning
In addition, the judge Friday questioned Manning about the statement, which he made during the time of testimony Thursday, saying that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before security guards and other prisoners in the morning.
Manning on said that was not possible cover blanket while checking.
Answering the questions the judge Friday, Manning on said that he understood from the command of the guard that must throw blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one does not directly ordered him to throw it.
Manning on Thursday said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked for his attempts to show that he is not a danger to himself.
Manning on reported that the officer said that could use gum shorts or flops, to injure themselves, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken out of the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least, will take into consideration the fact that he had to endure while in detention, and substantially reduce the sentence in the case, if Manning on will be found guilty of military court, which should start to review his case in early next year.
The protection has said that it plans to offer Manning to accept blame for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
A resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were acquitted.
The Pentagon argues that Manning on detained in Quantico in accordance with rules governing the content of those arrested with the strict regime.
Among the accusations, including Manning, are aiding the enemy, the illegal sharing of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to the national defense, and the abduction of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts indictment, he could face life imprisonment.

My crisis national self-determination - the story of American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize myself.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times.
Ruben navarett believes that Mexicans American origin torn between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico I went down the corridor for arriving, approached the border control zone and remained in place.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for foreign (foreigners).
A few seconds I stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Later I stopped on a complex construction of the "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
Because I took his American passport and was in turn to foreign.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual for meetings of presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States.
He wants to sign an agreement on partnership with the US and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not mention.
For Mexico's relations with the United States - heavy and filled with old grievances question.
Most Americans have never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and the rifles forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.
That is why it is worth only a statesman us obmallvitsya word criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society there are complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyayutsya militancy.
The most complex are Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin, living in the United States.
You want to talk about grievances?
Enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find in this country for themselves, and those for whom such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point their family history of someone - the father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
It often were Mexicans a certain type of dark complexion, from poor farming families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about this.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and good work, but we do not forget the fact that even this dream is an American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination запутано and it is not clear, but we know what to think of their country.
The United States of America.
Besides, we know that the majority of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class don't like us.
We respond to them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating defeats and refer to us as a second-class people, as the Mexicans wanted.
We are not well speak Spanish, and our relations with Mexico are strong enough.
Our very existence for them due to failure.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We were not now would be for the silk curtain, finding in the U.S. сытую life, but lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States in childhood, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexican origin is shame.
It is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends of the Mexican-Americans do not feel belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
In the US and call us Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relations without enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want to Mexican-Americans worked a sort of Mexico's ambassadors and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell their friends-Americans about what is a beautiful country and how cool her to attend, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing will.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between the rich and the poor, widespread corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
Sorry, but]; figure it out with this themselves, амигос.
And this is true.
If part of the Mexicans still can't forgive the United States, as they did with Mexico and a half century ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican origin still in grievances, as recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps we have more in common than it seemed to me.

The old battle on the new Middle East
The agreement on a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas's can be fragile foundation for further world
Lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sound familiar, meaningless disputes about who first began; many buildings turned into ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his izvechnom conflict in the Middle East came changes.
This can be treated differently, but the events of "Arab Spring" zakruzhili in rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelis not managed to stay away from the vortex, sector region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than previously.
However, there are reasons, giving hope for a way out of this impasse.
The war without winners
At first glance the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed this week clash only strengthened security on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, came to power in Gaza in 2007, from the fact that they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses incurred.
Despite the fact that some of the groups leaders were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas increases his popularity on the west bank of the Jordan River - another Palestinian territory currently controlled more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may come to the conclusion that the time working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new powerful and rich friends.
Resurgent regional leader Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among the Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.
Victorious Hamas supporters say about creating around Israel Islamic crescent - from Lebanon to the north, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more proislamistic rebels overthrow Bashar Assad's power, and then to Jordan, where the king threaten Hamas allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas.
Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, are the organization, largely similar with Hamas, and their leaders are more inclined to populism.
In future diplomatic rasstanovkah Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard" line in Israel come to opposite conclusions.
In military terms Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli anti-missile system "Iron Dome" justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of Hamas rockets.
Israel's citizens can sleep calmly, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular in the Binyamin Netanyahu's government, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets from the Gaza Strip, Israel managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the west bank of the River Jordan is a significant part of the recognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the January 22 election - teamed up with even more aggressively-minded conservatives led by infrastructure Lieberman's very convenient.
What sense does pander to the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If to give in their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from rockets toward Israel, as do their kin in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps, supporters of the "hard line" victorious; but their calculations can be refuted by Arab Spring.
The fact that the Islamists, who have come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not very warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.
Israel's defense part of the budget, more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
Outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help governments Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
The pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire, is a good sign, and may mark the beginning of change.
In Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As the democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later explode in Israel's occupied territories, like the house, vzorvannomu in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operation, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip for the suppression of the Hamas movement, has to pay the growing discontent with the international community.
Both sides need in the external pulse
It remains the only solution, to which relentlessly call sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of the two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.
Hope, not too impressive in the short term, "hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has long time to shut off the supply of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967 with the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah movements.
It would have made more for creation of a Palestinian state, rather than the upcoming vote in the UN, the result of which may become a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood.
His role in the arranged Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House he still shows the unwillingness to connect to solve this problem.
This same short-term thinking position.
The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

The federal government of Australia said that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of fashionable status.
The basis for such decisions lay the results of the research, the benchmark that people, do not smoke began to 26 years, 99 out of 100 never become smokers.
"it is obvious that even in the very young children understand the meaning, who are trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," said Health Minister Tanya plibersec, citing research, Ken that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so that these changes do not affect the profit multinational corporations, but the possibility of such measures are already considering, and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that it is only increase the share of black market, which will be sold on the cheap and available cigarettes.
"this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his initiators," says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for the British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that demand for the kind and silicone bags, hides unpleasant images on the packaging, grew rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra ha, Zico, the company has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party.
For us, this is a good business.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population, on which these measures.
After the adoption of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers to cigarettes in a visible place, advertising of tobacco products have moved to the Internet.
The government of Australia has banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it can't restrict the foreign sites.
"if you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods on the Internet will seem to you very tempting," - explains беки Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman said the growing number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether it is the ordinary citizen, who so loves Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare forces and the time and made the video, or for the advertising campaign?
The company's Australian branch of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is more busy adaptation to the new rules, rather than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge New Rules: these states have claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries' trade relationship with Australia is very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya plibersec, the government consulate has discussed with other countries to take similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory pictures, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now it is usually taken in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovations.
These pictures I don't graze.
I just don't pay attention.
"just vyhvatyvaesh cigarette and pryachesh pack in his pocket," - explains Viktor Al Haig, buys cigarettes with a photograph of the mouth tumors on the set.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me throw is my little daughter.
James Yiu, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging difficult task of goods on the shelves
"before I had the unloading of the new party left an hour, and now four hours'," he complains.
"the government had to take and to ban cigarettes, we would then said: what to do, OK, everything's over, close shop," he says, vskidyvaya hands up.

Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
In this Thanksgiving day I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of our aircraft mechanical failures and replaced by another plane, which we were pending.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even a duty-free shops.
However, in recent years, more and more scientists and specialists on child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored is not so bad.
It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that, perhaps, promotes creativity.
As in the modern world, we are constantly in front of the screen, the benefits of boredom pass us.
Maybe we should strive to boredom?
Yes.
And, at the same time, no.
We will come back to this.
I, like many others, believed that boredom is the invention of the relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not so, says Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, author of the book "fascinating history boredom" (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"in fact, boredom can boast a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in помпеях discovered Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating from the first century.
It remains an open question, as we understand the tedium.
The problem is, says John D. Иствуд, associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changing.
Having studied the materials research on this topic and asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor иствуд and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but they can't do that would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is the fact that skuchayuschiy man is not doing something that would like to do.
The Apathy didn't want to do.
The main experienced boredom, he said, it is a "violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a feeling that the time is slowly."
The description of the boredom may seem very similar to depression.
But Professor иствуд argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, skuchajošiem people see causes problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people undergoing depression, see problems in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that we're bored, when in fact we just hard on something to focus.
In his study of "one mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor иствуд with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, participants listened to the recording voices, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the case, included in the next room, heard the same sounds on low volume, so that they could barely hear, and the third group only listened to the recording voices without any sound track.
Those participants who heard TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, more than others - it was difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed this boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption attention can cause weariness, says Mark J. fensk, associate professor of neurology at the University of guelpa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, "for example, studying the flow of products on line in search of marriage, militarization deflects music can help avoid boredom."
It is considered, he continues, that when people start pokachivatsya on a chair or paint scribble on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions are simply not relax physically.
"research has shown that children who do not prohibit fidget and swing, learn better and remember more information than children, from which require sit tight," says Professor fensk.
In some moments we all relish tedium: when flight delay (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, browsing uninteresting kind film.
But different people have different degree inclination to boredom.
In the 1980s for measuring such individual peculiarities of researchers have developed a special "scale propensity to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, "a lot of what I have to do, monotonous and" or "me too much interesting, so that not enough time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers found that boys more than girls, "said Stephen vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of external stimuli.
In general, however, teenagers often.
In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted the pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teens reported that they get bored in school and during homework, and 23% reported that they get bored outside the school.
The only 3% of parents said that they get bored.
Professor Larson notes that he had no information about what would be similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that, "adolescence is the peak propensity to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents do not allow us to fully resolve than they do.
Back to my original question: boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, as she studies show, can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or misuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor vodanovich, who has spent studying the problem more than two decades.
"so our brain tells us that we should do something else; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this is the brain does not always knows what exactly do better.
If you will get bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
However, if you're watching TV, you will be better for some time, and it will be soon.
So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom independently or in any other way to manage their time and employment, "said Professor fensk.
"and such self-regulation skills used in the most different situations," he says.
Your child learns not only on their own to borrow something, he also learns self-in general.
I don't think that bores you need something praise.
But consider it something bad is not worth it.
Rather it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action, and technology.
Professor иствуд agree with this.
"we see it so that we need more experience boredom, with that boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people tend to disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax.
"in the modern world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when the silence, and the way we do not know what to do."

While it is unclear how will apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, nineteen-year-old player football team and the student public college in the south-east of Colorado accused of committing a criminal offence, which has been the fact that soon will be quite legitimately on the entire territory of the state: possession of small portions of marijuana and tubes, in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says that once he was in September with friends in Lamar and riding in a car on the prairies near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by police.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came agenda in court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug use - minor offences, for each of which owe a fine of $100 - and set the date of trial.
"with US treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But whether he was a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small-scale trials depends not so much from the law, how many from consideration.
Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana, already charged in hundreds of cases, here and in Washington, which has adopted a similar measure.
Police stations already ceased to nominate people in 21 years of age and older for possession of small amounts that will be seen as legitimate, as only a couple of weeks the law comes into force.
However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors took the decision to consider the case, associated with marijuana, and still attract the responsibility for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the Mountain West vote for something to prevent the emergence of in their places, the new state shops licensed to sell marijuana.
"all this is growing so rapidly that I don't even know what to expect," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of supervisors in Washington also ozadacheno pochesyvayut head.
They will shape the rules for determining the order of licensing cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it is all you need to do until December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, it is good or bad, ahead of most other states in regulating the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"in Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," - explains Brian Smith, a spokesman for the Council on regulation of production and sales of alcoholic products in the state of Washington.
But now no one can do more, recognizes Mr. Smith, than to nominate any proposals and hope that it will work.
"we have no real precedent on which we could be," he says.
The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and on the whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is not yet, and the right of possession of marijuana.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state of "adequate access" to a licensed marijuana prohibition on trade with it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"it is especially difficult to place the licensed trade marijuana in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the newly established research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. "
November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora sent his subordinates e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office no longer will attract people, age of 21, the responsibility for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops ulichat people in these violations "from this moment."
Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue drug traffickers and distributors.
County prosecutor Weld's role in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to attract the responsibility for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage use of its people to undergo treatment.
Currently 119 persons indicted in storage and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"our duty is to pursue for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr. tank in a statement.
The reaction has been patchy, even in places like rural Mesa County, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Grand Junction police, the biggest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of small amounts of drugs.
The District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take charge of already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law as long as he doesn't change is our duty," he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of residents of the state of Colorado who took part in the voting, supported this decision, including the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be simple.
And the confused reaction of residents in different places of the state's economic relations local authorities to experiment with marijuana.
"the district prosecutors in this issue there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean makalister, claims, the lawyer representing the interests of convictions for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"they are so long persecuted people for it, that now may not truly come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington - the first states, in which a small number of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in the scale of the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Advocates of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time, they are cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal authorities, who still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Marijuana legalization supporters hope that the Department of Justice in this matter.
Despite several received wide resonance arrests traders and patients, doing marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave welcome on trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Bureau agents to combat the drug is unlikely to rush home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly blind eye on regulated by the authorities of the state of recreational marijuana shops, which are permitted under the new law, "said Kevin Sabet, a former adviser to struggle with drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores selling marijuana, and so could not open earlier than a year.
Last week, a city in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration by the six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
"we don't want to be in this position, that we supply you with someone license, then this will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have there is the contradiction between the results of the local voting and those that voted for the state.
There is still a lot of unresolved issues.

Petronella whiatt: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I'm a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views, not today.
How much I remember myself, I always dreamed to attend Oxford University.
My father and brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, zakladyvayuschiy two foundations of civilization - forthright dissidence and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study on the historical faculty woosterskogo College at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I collected bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not pass and burst into tears.
Friends were bewildered at the.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I threw college, because I don't like that my classmates have sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from Shcherbatykh cups.
In fact, all was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I systematically hounded and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I was in a private school.
I was only for one reason, and in this renowned cradle righteousness it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow whiatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was negotiated conservatives.
You ask, why to remember about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, rising center-right views, is the same persecution.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as that which is disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives from the student club of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge claim that their "often actively isolate, subjected to personal attacks and are forced to feel unwanted guests" due to their political views.
They want to enter in the committee on equal rights college additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their only exacerbated the situation released recently on BBC Two documentary film about politics in the student environment "country wonders: young, smart and right-wing," in which the Conservatives presented eccentric and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, which travels in Rolls-Royces, wears a silver suit and stick with silver nabaldashnikom.
In other universities students-conservatives complain that they are "scapegoats for higher fees for their studies."
Luc black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of Conservative University, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in the university environment increases skew toward the left.
The people who we don't even know, we believe in advance and unruly children with impunity arrogant rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Corpus Christi College, which was filed petition on strengthening protection, calls such an atmosphere "neuutist," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of the student club to center-right views has deteriorated significantly.
"this is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for normal life members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was the one.
I was there in September 1986, timid and shy vosemnadtsyatyletneu girl.
Oxford from hatred to the Conservative party.
The year before, the University of voting deprived former encountered Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree of due to budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even сталинистам.
In the first days of the week, when freshmen students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt what awaited me ahead.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through the fingers on badger-conservative students, but also gladly took part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and the government's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through trimmed wooden panels walls audiences.
On my first seminar I needed to translate French eighteenth-century text in English, and I was not ready to ensure that followed it.
"miss whiatt," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, please, the first paragraph. "
The text was with me, I hesitated.
Harry Pitt was very желчным man with a face like a wedding cake.
"thatcherist fundamentally not teach French or they simply do not have enough?" he asked.
Other students sniggered behind their.
I have tears to the eyes.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his spare time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in the society," - probryuzzhal Pitt.
I returned to my room absolutely miserable.
In the evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second year student at the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of Conservative University.
"I know who you are," he said.
"unfortunately, it is as follows:
Over every, who suspect in supporting the Conservatives, will get me down.
I myself not easy, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the freshmen-conservative hypocritical that they Labour. "
Later, in the local pub, I timidly tried to hypocritical.
I insisted that don't agree with all that says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick has failed.
Read philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "you're the daughter of fascist pigs.
You are contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was worn, dirty.
"as the Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"they beat each other, right?"
I felt so, as must be felt homosexuals to the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the Sixties.
If I ever to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I forced to become Britain and hide their true beliefs?
The coming three years, I began to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriters.
In college he practically never appeared.
He despised for its remoteness, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist-deterministicmu view of history.
. Nagorno Karabakh conflict, Turkey, for at the Bilkent the post профессорскую year's it adopted in 1997
"here you won't be happy," he told me.
I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and impartial Metropolitan friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in 1940 to 1948 years, there were any political views.
"but it's the best university in the world," he said.
"there is not capable of, not only in the city of dreaming spires...
Even my friends-Communists always behaved impeccably. "
His wet eyes pomutneli.
"don't pick up any hasty decisions.
I am sure that this is just a joke.
You разобьешь my heart, if left the university. "
I was изнурена regular visits to London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, not withstood pressure and refused to their beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when another history teacher quite seriously called me "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the soul сгорая from shame, I admitted that "I brainwashed brains parents," and called them "old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the same time every week he wrote two columns for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I am not, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I gathered my suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I have not returned.
Can call me plaksoy and cloth.
But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.
The worst that it was Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers Tories, but to this day is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and forthright dissidence.

This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character which - "Il Signor" Garavani, but she could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt a rare and distant world nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, Abound personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salim Aga Khan to Lord snowdona, including Marie-Chantal, Greece, and Princess Margaret, Britain's Princess.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social recovery: from the modest dress of voger city in the north of Italy to the international elite "Idol."
To be in the Royal Court - there is nothing wrong.

Among them are the antorus Vijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn a living prey sulfur in the top of a volcano kavakh-idzhen, located on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Every day the antorus descends on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, congeals in contact with air.
Otkolov huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which may reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on his shoulders and carry them up the precipitous rocky road.
Up to the top of the volcano, which is the height of the analyses are shown meters, only 250 meters, but ismozhdenic gruzchik takes more than 40 minutes to climb a snail's pace, with difficulty holding the balance and carefully nashupyvaya road, so as not to fail and not fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them life, as happened with one from France, which started a few years ago with rocks kavakh-igena.
Miners with kavakh-igena earn 5 euro cent for every kilogram of sulphur, which are mined
Once at the top, they pave the road between the tourists who they were, as if they were monkeys from the circus, and wearily carrying heavy baskets, around three kilometres to the weights, which mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
It is about the PT Kandy ngrimbi, Enterprise, which operates in 1960, the volcano and better, and not to say its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro cent) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 CT) petrochemical industries, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
, euros or UK £3,8 as, as the votes in rupees (must any 46.000 is hodka perenoska. Roughly living 70 to kgs-,. Day-to-day cases carrying serves is the antorus which is, says our
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels exhausted, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems mizers for such efforts, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"podennaya fee miners is very high by local standards, where coffee for collecting pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly earnings equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," - explains Porter seemed, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
His salary was just 75.00 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the plot was not so heavy, but the antorus returned with his family in bâniovangi, the town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same overwhelming, as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and carried it on including JAWA, so she accepted Islam."
The antorus have asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes slezyatsya due to toxic gases
In his 27 years spent three years, risking a kavakh-idzhen, sulfur which has already started to affect him despite the availability of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes slezyatsya due to toxic gases, which allocates the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving their dreams.
"'ll go another two years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," - he promises to more than acceptable English.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be tourist guide, waiter or doorman at the hotel, but instead he performs work mule.
Dividing dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he gets up every day in two hours of the night, because sulfur does not cease to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and shines in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, the antorus descends in the crater, covering a small flashlight, podsoedinennym to his miner's, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters drag basket with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, mining company not mechanized extraction sulphur for cost savings and does not provide any equipment носильщикам, who work at his own expense, and with such deprivation.
In fact, they are not even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for the shooting, which, along with the input ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people-mules.
"this work for cattle, and not for the people," said badrusin, a stocky Porter 42 years, who spent on kavakh-idzhen three decades, since he left college.
Able to raise up to 110 pounds, he assures that will endure work "so much, how many will be able," because he needed money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.
Do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur burn the throat and eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their heavy disease... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and ulcers on his shoulders, who deformirovalis under the weight of their baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, unaynik now only can raise 50 kilogram in 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck transporting the warehouse in tamansari, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on the narrow path after.
"do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," said unaynik, widely opening your mouth, which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also works carrier sulphur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation is one of the most severe in the world: what do human mules with kavakh-igena.

Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"Singapore's population is growing."
I husband Patriot, you are my wife patriotka, our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising мятных loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local saying like "let's put Bao (булку) in the stove," to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
The advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH's, entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they would draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music, so people have fulfilled their national debt. "
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world on the continuation of a similar, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government attempted to do a lot of things, such as the launch of spirits with pheromones or organize parties fast dating (blitz-visits).
Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap?
The child's 1.2
Who does not take it so lightly, because it is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm for the birth of the greater number of children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extending maternity leave and maternity and provides tax benefits.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in South-East Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national management of the population, is currently on the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the national population, says that the reason for the improved education "and" a wide range of career opportunities. "
"this allowed people to have a wide range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of" family, "she explains.
These changes social norms contribute to the growth in the number of young Bachelor or Bachelorette and long delays marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the population reduction, causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore have Web sites, where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which criticized for maintaining salaries at a low level and unwillingness to integrate.
Immigration growth also is seen as one of the reasons that in the past year, the ruling party Singapore received the worst result in the election since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling fertility has known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to not built up so much of a small housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
Guide on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments of 46 square meters sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute to holostomu lifestyle and deprive incentive developers who want to build a big family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of this company El developers, says that their "shoe box" sold much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash income increases.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give more clear benchmarks for developers, who had been a major embarrassment, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too perenapryazhennye
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of the national birth rate increase, after talking with singaporians, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"people are very over-stretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and due to this many people this delay," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"but for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons that prevent them to have children.
So, as the government would neither encourage their citizens to birth children, in fact, as regards procreation, the last word remains for singaporians.

Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about private property or the "sphere of privacy, which have the right to protect from any interference."
What is personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he uses this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks?
Whether he understands danger, which is under discussion in the Internet situations, which would certainly not shared outside of the Internet?
Elperiodico took an interview with five guys from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they were associated with the term "something very my," in a private plane, and "password and username" when used it to social networks.
"my greatest secrets, I would not be downloaded in the post," says Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of personal on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"this is a very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
FB I beautiful pictures or pictures from the Games.
Also I play with their friends.
"I would not have shared a photo, which is not my, or someone who behaves stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that bad publishing obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write offensive or furious comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends that he had in the FB, and nine of their folloverov in Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
The mother in the course, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I take to Twitter to express themselves and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if I meet, I only their possible," he added.
"social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with their friends on the rapid," - he points out.
Without thinking, that never would have received a request from the unfamiliar faces.
Would not be with someone who would have recommended that the stranger.
The case of a 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager is open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latest admits that he did not know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"it doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," - he points out.
According to the boy, no one to him not utiralsya in trust and not asked his home address or phone number.
"if I become pressure or require, simply remove them from their account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is not alien experience that today is known as cybermobbing.
One friend of my girlfriend blackmail in the social network.
He threatened and extorted money.
"he never found out who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, not removed account.
"only included confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up the account safe way.
Unlike Jorge, the boy would be uploaded photos of friends in the uncomfortable or confuznyh situations.
Yes, I would have done it, if people don't like me or if I want to.
"although I know that this cybermobbing", "he confirms.
Key questions
Marjelos Porras, English and an expert on education and training, believes that, in order to send children and teenagers, you need to understand that the goal of social networks - to inform.
"the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Porras indicates that the Academician Mark prenski, master Pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
"we digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we still have to learn," she says.
Explains that this issue is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria that you can or can't distribute, publish or speak, at age, when maturity is not enough for this."
"also that they were selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show that the confidentiality of children and adolescents, is to ask questions that make them think.
"to tell them that they did this," useless, "she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you would not be told the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked, if published a photo you like the one that you published about his friend?
Do you know that the other publish about you?
When you sign photos with parties, whether you ask for permission from other people, to mark them?
And one more thing, all you need to know, what are you doing in every moment?
Another option is to give them to understand that they must behave online, just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"outside of the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, the same should be in social networks," she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need to heads of families conscientiously read the policy of social networks.
Understanding each of the items, they have good reasons for talks with children about the prerequisites of opening an account on the Internet.
"for example, age and the fact that allowed to distribute or to publish," he says.
According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children a lesson "don't talk to strangers."

"South America must learn from Europe in the issue of integration" citizenship: Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), to be held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "killing each other during the second world war" and in other clashes, "but now they are virtually one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, a project of American citizenship, who approve of the countries-participants of the UNASUR.
"we need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers on any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sector, who want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president showed himself, moreover, a supporter of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact San Jose on human rights.
Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, to sign it.
"inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that does not regret this decision, because with him he betrayed his principles, and maintained their "deepest values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in his time "were certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be respected process."
He criticized, moreover, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged crime on sexual violence, while "the Swedish law considers it possible to carry out his through video conferencing, which could make from Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of a deterioration in the physical and mental health Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since, as he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he was a pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
Indeed, that there is the danger of his deteriorating physical and mental health of confined in a small space without the possibility to do exercises on air.
"it affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum, Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that the negotiations were in London on the search for a solution to the problem of prison of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating about human rights, this word in this case, we do not use, but there were constant debate.
"the solution to this problem is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange's lawyer, бальтасар Garzon, leads a number of processes in various European courts," - he mentioned.
And expressed his opinion that "if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee integrity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it allows its legislation and how it has done in other cases, will be examined by Senor Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London or will be examined by his on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press, and stressed that "does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"the main enemies of freedom of the press is not corrupted villains-policy, and bad journalists, supporting speculative, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect he remained satisfied that these journalists, "neither bankers nor the bourgeois country-hegemons not dominate in Ecuador," and added that being reelected, "deepen the revolution to continue the development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain veto Paraguay in the UNASUR, at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and will not tolerate opportunism and support coups under the guise of legality," because in reality "it has eroded the legitimacy of the plane of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considers, moreover, "absolutely justified" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos's lead is now negotiating with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaragua's old maritime sovereignty.
At the moment it is the solution is not observed.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome desire to go together.
You need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed his hope for a good end dispute about sea borders, which are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and suggested that the "right to Latin America's access to the international court, if the two countries undertake to adopt a decision, whatever it may be."
Regarding the ability to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if loses the election in February 2013, then withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed only by political power.
"my political movement decided that it was exactly what I guaranteed the probable victory, so you have to accept this responsibility," he said.
In case of victory this would be my last term in office of the president, and then we go out of public life.
If we lose out, the same.
"this decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked with Venezuelan vice-president Nicholas people see religious families, who told me that he went to the treatment, which has already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
"this does not mean escalation of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.

Mortality from AIDS today is the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I like are stunned," - he recalls the difficult, despite all the cycle of a doctor, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
By deciding to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible, and his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43-sixth birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest "HIV patients of the hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) already 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe - too little existed then treatment options, too little knew about the disease, too jaundiced treated patients.
Even so, the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had been cut."
In other words, in those times have AIDS was the sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome, and to do it, not worsening quality of life.
It, a come most so far, won when the of fewer than the and for no damaged knowing damage about your infections of the these, immune system истощил "of its and
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the patient's survival, which begins to timely treatment, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the HIV-branch of hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
An infectious disease specialist and an expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best expected life expectancy of those who are not drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when informed about 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that the one who gets diagnosed HIV-positive in the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," - he explained.
To assess this progress, we should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today in an average of 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), is also true that since AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; nevertheless, argues that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Летальные "deaths why still has --
"personally, I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I imagine, so the case in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have not had the lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don't know about his infitirovannom condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He led a devastating data: "nine out of ten patients come, when already have something opportunisticeskaya infection; what we need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality rate, so it is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who will be asked for it."
In its proposal opined specialists and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check in a private laboratory, motivated only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi's mother, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that die, and didn't want to know.

I propose to change it inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for the function and to hundreds of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places, who often visits the youth.
This is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is not about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether the distribution of condoms is possible under his leadership.

Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision that elides debt restructuring group Vitro, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the script sets a precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country, which has problems with solvency.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms, which are Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In practice, the approval of the decision June 15, Judge Harlin Hale bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Texas, leaves vulnerable Mexican firms in the face of a possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
But the decision opens the doors leading manufacturer of glass in Mexico for treatment in the Supreme Court of the United States, citing the evidence of three discrepancies.
As the entry, while the judge of the case notes that lenders should be governed by the U.S. bankruptcy code, the court of appeal of the Fifth District, located in New Orleans, says that the main trial for competitive manufacture, considered in Mexico.
The first item implies cancellation international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profile.
In fact, with this goal was created a model law for the unification of international trade law, determining the arbitrator shall American Institute of Law.

Nevertheless, this opportunity to recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, among which agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose mezhfirmennye debts guaranteed Federal Institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that subtracting voices branches, one way or the other lenders, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds "vultures" like aurelios capital, aurelios convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not have achieved majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These data omits the Court of Appeals.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which she faced since 2008, embrace a serious economic crisis, which to move the United States, by hitting the country.
So far the Gonzalez family garden gratifying appeal in the court of appeal, to vote came to his plenum, i.e., five judges, because only three voted.
In the case of our failures will be charged a petition about identity, which will require a review process with the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected the document, the government of Mexico in the role of ewcs do curiae ("friend of the court"), which described the process, which should be in the framework of the law on competition, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to link it with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy.
In addition, noted that the country surrender the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., the rules set for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carom from the two boards: they are beaten in vitro and beaten in the country.

Hector "khetin" Reyes: "basketball was my life"
An avid basketball traveler Hector "khetin" Reyes was more than 60 years associated with sports and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "khetin" Reyes.
And before the bleeding in the brain приковало his wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player small categories, a player of the highest basketball league, commissioner and head of the BSN with bayamona and president of the Basketball Federation.
"I did a lot of roles in basketball throughout his life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of BSN, director-general of the national team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during the visit Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with his wife, Isabel true for more than 50 years.
"basketball has been my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this statement.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorable things, collected for his long way, evidence of this.
Bayamon in the heart of
With big emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years his performance in the role of co-agent or agent contract.
"it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There was joy for many years, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year debut Jerome минси in BSN.
Since then, and to continue to lead became "kuko" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "said Reyes.
I remember that gin bartov, who was on his way here and he was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you there is a very strong player, the 6 '7."
"do you want?"
And it was the beginning of минси, one of the best players, who were from Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommended that the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if минси brought championship Bayamon, гаусс would have helped to win another one.
Championstv Cowboys with Gauss, but I'm already at a distance, because to 1988, already was the head of the Federation.
By the time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments минси in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The team with the 1990 World Cup is the best team, what you've ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games in 2004.
But my favorite was the one that, with the pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Championships.
The team not only played once again минси, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, FICO Lopez and 'pikulina' (Tailor Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'tonito' colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'кихоте' Morales, who was unable to participate in the 90 year due to a knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team Olympic qualifying tournament, 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like 'kanito' nyevsa, Pablo alisea and Rolando hurruitner young players in return, temporarily estranged for turmoil in panamericansk championship Mar del Plata, we won gold in spite of all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was pikulin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico not dominated at this level, as did pikulin.
And this is without his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best puertoricancem leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We have had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalma, armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work Leo arill.
What do you think his major achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalization smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessarily.
At least, I can see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for governors, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, icabel, which has always been with me.

But it was his interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. led Hagman on top of fame.

The course begins, which examines the "end of the world"
Each week the students explore apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharm decided to read about the end of the world, he knew that had the irresistible lure: the end of the "long countdown" Mayan calendar, on December 21, for which many people jumped as proof that heralded the end of the world.
But he had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddonom," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian end times theorists believe that will start the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said fashion this week, students at the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the present time, as if we have only 30 days, it was really a good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the latest in history.
In templsk University associate professor Barry Wacker reads the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Each week the students explore apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"we analyze why these ideas with time," he said, and the way that offer the hypothetical scenarios, causing certain human actions.
If the nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, the war could erupt.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they interact with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell students about the fact that maybe, probably, plausible, and it is impossible," said Wacker.
The main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of history of Latin America's Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is called simply "the end of the world."
"we do not add '2012', to always have the opportunity to read the course again, in the case of the end of the world," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students should learn to cook projects and to take final exams.
In the Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse that students leaves no other choice but to work "to the very night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"the place was for two hours," said Restall about its course for students with high scores on average, which did 35 students.
We have received e-mail messages for many weeks before the start of the semester from the people, who asked whether there is still space.
The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing, to console himself," said Brigid Robinson, 23-year-old student of sociology and religion from Haddonfield, New Jersey, the Rutgers-Camden.
And an apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it is only a question of consolation or its absence.
Will vecoesa, 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said that looked all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard about the course, which would be taught," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor is not said that believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"our first project touched Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we his discredited," said Julie zeglen, 21-year-old student at the University of templsk from West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is simply a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there are apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has a few centuries, where people react to changes around himself, predicted the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"in other places people don't think about it," he said.
Mainly in anglogovoryaschem world.
Joseph Dougherty would henceforth, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about a course about the "end of the world" there.
"the Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the appeal court.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Restall noticed that for a long time about many of the last days of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophizing that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said that are going to go to parties "the end of the world."
"may be, call someone from friends, to laugh together," said Samir Ford, 20-year-old student at the Faculty of communication.
