A Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
The Republican leaders justify their policy with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the latter is the Brennan Center is a myth, and confirm that the electoral fraud in the United States is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The attorneys for the Republicans have seen in 10 years in the U.S. only 300 cases of electoral fraud.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the United states for the conduct of the elections in the various states.
In this sense, the majority of the American governments since 2009, has announced new laws that the process for registering or the ballot.
This phenomenon has gained in importance after the elections on November 2010, which resulted in 675 new Republican representatives in 26 countries.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, which restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require that voters present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also will be shortened the time periods for the early vote, declared the law invalid, to register as voters on election day and citizens the right to vote, for which there is a legal acts.
Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. state has asked the voters to show photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has made such a request.
The United States Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend it to other states.
Over the last two years, in 34 states draft laws, which forced the voters to show photo identification.
It is important to note that the U.S. citizens do not unlike Quebec on an universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million vocal people no photo identification issued by a governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million Neuwähler in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, are often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary documents.
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years on the required photo ID.
This goes further.
The students who are seen as voters casting their votes for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed to use their photo ID issued by the establishment.
On the other hand, allow the same States members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote for the Republican side, to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state has called for proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state, who introduced such a request.
Since 2011 a dozen states have passed laws that require voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
Clearly these measures are designed to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have promoted 2011 in eight states have laws, doing away with the registration of voters on election day.
You have also restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to voter registration in the 2004 general election to register some 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the proportion of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006% by 17.
The Republican legislators in five other states have also adopted laws that aim to shorten the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida was 33% of the voters who elected in advance, African-Americans, even though they represent only 13% of voters in the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter was only 11% of voters, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the White, which represented 76% of the voters, only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the controversial legislation.
They could limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have laws that require the of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012, the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the 2012 key states.
A report by the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that those states that have adopted these laws, which make up 171 of the 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, some of these measures will undermine the democratic system the United States.

Prostate cancer screening: the test should not be made or?
In fact, the PSA test would sometimes incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater reluctance of undecided women for screening tests.
The test should not be made or?
We have sought the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States passed numerous confounding factors between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret this data and to give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that in a follow-up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasized by 30% to 40% higher if no screening was.
That is why I recommend the test at the age of 50 or 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was already ill with prostate cancer.
In men of American origin, there is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was identified.
There are cancers that aggressive and others who are indolent.
Really understand the magnitude of the risk of cancer the patients must be made by him to the possible options, which can remain untreated prostate crabs, if he does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and in these cases to prefer an active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many of the men, which is cancer, no treatment, not because their cancer is aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
It proposes an active monitoring them and offers them in advance of the disease treatment.
With increasing accuracy determined the criteria for a decision that should be dealt with.
I therefore recommend the implementation of the tests.
But the most important thing is to talk to his doctor to determine whether or not he should be carried out.
In cooperation with the international society for urology Movember has developed an instrument with which it is possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA tests.
This document (currently only available in English, but a translation will be available soon) can be downloaded at the following address: http: / / ca.movember.com / fr / mens Health / prostate cancer screening
To prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if all eating well and will be sufficient.
"If there were no smoking, this value would rise at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of cancers caused by inheritance.
Several remain unresolved.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the fall in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It damages the health of the people.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying from cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
It seems the risk for breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and cervical cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout the entire life," he adds.
The diet
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In great quantity it increases the risk of developing a Grimm or rectal cancer.
Salami should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can harm the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Currently, but their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society are the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
A study has found that reducing the risk of prostate cancer, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D to cancer was also has not yet clear.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is to talk with his doctor about his concerns and his family history.
"The implementation of a screening test does not lead to cancer."

The Higgs boson analysed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs Bos' last summer has caused a stir, and for good reason.
It is believed that the boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence the Standard Model - our best or the least "false" statement of nature and the behavior of matter -, predicted, but not been observed empirically.
But for the physicist, it is not yet completely sure that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particles, and that it is similar to the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs boson.
It seems to be confirmed by new data to be presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there are no data to be completely secure.
We are assuming that it is indeed the Higgs, since there is apparently only a small risk of getting things wrong, and we look at what is at stake.
In this world there is inevitably a crucial law that that can't be two objects in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard, because you are hurt.
Because even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it is also applies to them: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles can occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state," with a law "state" by and large, of some of its properties.
On this basis, the physicists share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, who are known as Fermi one and obey polite the Pauli principles.
And in the other the bosons, a nasty bunch of anarchists, which is nothing sacred not in any case, the precautionary principle, which means that they can find themselves in the same time, at the same place.
These bosons divided according to the website the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is absolutely amazing) into two groups: the Greek barys, which we will deal with here and the "power particles," through which the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson, would be used.
It must be stressed, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures, as you might think.
If you are able to read this story, then only thanks to a Bosons exceptional banality: the photon, or particle of the "light" that the "messenger" is of electromagnetic force.
If a particle with an electric charge or change the direction of the electromagnetic field on this "disrupted," as a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and therefore one of the bosons "sources of power."
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, "disrupted," so that shows the boson.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen has to achieve very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface could be spall only by a very large rocks.
That is why a giant particle accelerator as CERN, the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with an of 27 km! - In order to achieve this kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful in the relationship between the Higgs and the crowd.
It is not in fact all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but not others - for example, would never keep a piece of paper from the fridge.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the other (like the photon) have no mass.
For all this research, "which can be good," says Mrs Plamondon?
For the science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow the physicists, all deviations between the observations and to investigate the predictions of the SM.
There are also many physicists who sincerely hope that such discrepancies are found, because the slightest difference open a door to a "new physics" and could fill a few holes of the model.
It must be said that there are still major shortcomings in the latter, because there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!), and the dark matter, which is about 80% of matter in the universe (again ups!).
But at the CERN such deviations were not found until now.
Impact
The implications of this research for the general population are difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be no.
By the way: in the early 60 s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs have that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - has worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser in the 1960 s was invented 1962, and even the first laser (the first was NI) has developed - said that the laser at the beginning rather than a "gimmick."
Imagine...
In addition, there are also applications for all the instruments that surround the research.
For example, in turn, has developed warm Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the pulp a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of this sensor today all digital cameras worldwide as "eye" and has won him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC inevitably will change our lives, but it means that you can never really know...

Palliative care - the best way to die...
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of life.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, there remains to be done in this important area.
Financing academic has tried to look as this.
A few weeks ago Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, it aufzehrte, had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me to live five years, I have managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, in his bed at home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Belo pursuit, in which he arrived the previous the day.
"It is always a shock, however, it is not to be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: a huge weakness prevents him from going to the toilet and even to eat.
On the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned, agrees to help.
He even manages to smile bravely and speak with strangers who are around him, give him his medication, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary people.
"My greatest wish is that my cures diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this disease.
"During our lifetime we learn that loves a man standing," says Pierre Brod, psychologist Victor Gadbois at home.
In return, the childhood phase for some people is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept a retrograde step, he says.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, big events in the midst of setbacks.
The patients who are admitted into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, be they from the doctors and nurses who care for them, not inundated with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89, is the worst fear, "and" to die by suffocation.
But the disease I learned my children really know.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no wishes to be in life," she says, before accepting that it set up a mask that helps her breathe.
They expected in the next few days, a recent visit by her son, who is from Italy.
Based on Victor Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers personal care and assistance in the food.
The palliative care is used if there are no other options.
In order to make the deaths.
In Quebec, with 11,700 inhabitants a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little, given that we will all die one day.
It is simply a continuation of the life in the best possible conditions, said Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
It provides for the dying, according to a with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control blood sugar levels.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we served a beer Mr X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," says nursing director Nathalie Savard.
Based on Victor Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, the last family gathering in the courtyard and is supported well by his pillow, while opening up to his honor, a young man of 36 years dies, which is surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, tragically, having tried everything in order to survive.
"For six months are three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of the pet Victor Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, when they have reached the final stage of their lives, both at home, in a hospital or a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the pet Victor Gadbois and society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this major shortcomings in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors look forward to the adoption of of a law on euthanasia and assistiertem suicide with concerns.
Since the month of October is a manifesto, signed by prominent figures in the palliative care as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec the health system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to a high-quality palliative care before accepting move to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency room, has taken measures to alleviate.
I fear that patients want to die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
The, while several oncologists treat their patients despite worst predictions fought until the last day.
The survival of Hélène Richard were minimal, as it has broken off a difficult chemotherapy.
As I told my oncologist that I will drop out of the treatment, she said to me that they regret that I am giving up the fight, told.
However, she said to me that I was at the end.
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die, thank the nursing staff that it has not granted this wish, after their pain has been eased by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said clearly that is not the Continuum palliative care for pain treatment.
After a young man Monereau, director of the palliative care of society is not talking of domestic palliative care of Greater Montreal 8% of patients in pain treatment.
At the very end of life so doctors often back to the C-terminal sedation, which seeks to lull the patients either permanently or intermittently until the time of his death.
We can no longer act as if we do not see this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to use this C-terminal sedation.
Patients, not to alleviate their pain, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean, "I want to put me," but "I would like to see reduced my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible on the basis of a journalism scholarship Canadian health research institutes.

Real estate major scandals in Quebec
Officials of the roads, companies in the building industry sector, political parties and fundraisers specialists of the Italian mafia tell every day what they know about a great "system," in the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry," which was very expensive for the taxpayer of Quebec, especially in the 1990 s and 2000 s.
"It is strange how the system, since it has taken drastic measures," Sperling jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Member of Montreal in Quebec and a former head of the police.
The scandal was exposed by him on the basis of a thorough investigation into the embezzlement in connection with the treaties to road construction in Quebec, who agreed to the then prime minister reluctantly.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the study in 2010," he said, "the transport ministry alone would have saved a billion dollars of the Treaties," because some zügelten its instinct to get their share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors on a case-by-case basis," he adds, in the hope that it can "to show the tactics behind the individuals."
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit
Launched in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit is with its troops to auditors, investigating and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police force, "and was," which since 2009 has ensured that the "sewer cartel" Montreal is in the artificial inflation of of the Treaties cautious...
In recent weeks it has made a series of raids and made allegations of fraud and corruption against local officeholders, such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marc Otte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third largest city, has resigned.
He is suspected of repeatedly received in exchange for public contracts bribes.
Incidentally, engineers were specifically accused of road construction official from Montreal, and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has attracted attention by the Commission of the operation of the "system" has declared for the preservation of public contracts.
He himself has paid for several years in Montreal received 3% of the value of the contracts to a broker linked to the Mafia, who gave the money to the Union, the party of mayors Geraldine Tremblay.
Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 s has had his hand in the game by more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also confessed to organising an illegal fund-raising for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normand Jauneau.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of have been artificially inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described in detail the Commission: in ten years ago, he received from the construction company gifts and invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736,000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, whose cost it artificially pumping up.
Other Road Administration officials have admitted that they did, by aufblähten smear the bills with false services artificially by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay, that he has deliberately overlooked a shadow budget, filled its coffers with undeclared money.
As a result of these revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, which left Montreal in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau, was one of the first Members of Montreal, proposed the alarm.
As mayor of the District Rivière of Prai Ries, in the east of the island, they declined from 2010 against the sale of municipal land that bought for $5 million and was sold for 1.6 million of property developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
The study, conducted at the end of the, she says that it "takes on a thread, which it to understand the operation of the suspected of ants system to stop this evil and denounce those responsible."
She says that the process "painful, but positive."
We are about to clean the wound, but need a certain investigative unit, only for Montreal and supervision to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How do you clean.
Regularly.
For its part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars," but especially concerned about the role of "office holders, who are the tactics in the picture," if they were not involved in the fraud.
Based on a 70% share of black money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he jokes: "I was told that this is a poor substitute for reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties at $100, according to what he would change nothing about the situation: "as long as the election campaign spending will be strictly limited, black money in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "we must not go deeper; when we get to the bottom with courage, we can can build a house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story is damaging the international image of Quebec in Montreal, calls Mr Duchesneau those who laugh about it, to look in their own backyard...

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season with PSG have adopted a new scale.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it with a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I am on their side.
The technical staff has given me a lot.
These factors spurring me on a daily basis to improve my game.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football everything is going very quickly.
But I must stop in enthusiasm.
Since my early days at the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine up to my time in St Etienne I have always made gradual progress.
They take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer the newcomers are used to host games very high levels.
They also know that every training session.
This means that a player like me, and wants to give his best.
Incidentally, it gives me a lot in terms of my game Carlo.Its Ancelotti.
It is supported by other coaches as Claude blemish, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti breathes all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there are currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I had a good conversation with him.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust that he has put in me, is also an explanation for my services.
What do you think about the first part of the season of PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon has taken the place of the top.
But we are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the World Cup.
What is the objective of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as much as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First, we want to be the first of our group in Porto, so that we can deal with the return leg of the eighth and final home game.
The PSG can be a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
In order to become a major European club, to win Paris title and make a name for the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG financial resources, so that this project is the concrete forms.
It would be a great failure to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, it is really important for us to cream off the title.
In the last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to secure the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
You should normally be champion with 79 points...
But another team, those of Montpellier, has made an even better season.
I believe that this is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux fight for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been done and the players that we have, it is natural that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
If we win with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and it is still something that cannot be accused, this is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to draw up a game plan.
A team builds over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
You look at Manchester City, a club for two seasons, to qualify for the eighth final, and also has made huge spending.
With regard to the amounts invested you believed to break with 15 points ahead of the.
This would mean that would let our opponents and the French Cup.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not in the last season, this new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 exciting.
I hope that we will be in the month of May by the smiling winner and tell us that we have won despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that of a "Zlatan dependence."
This means that Ibrahimovic is performing well and scores many goals.
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has had in mind that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surrounded him.
What he has done is exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Taina Silva, who is one of the best defenders, allowing the rest to make progress.
As you have seen the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I was anxious to take part in this championships.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from glean some game time.
I have seen things, which I am emerged strengthened.
Today, I will be able to make good games in the national team.
This was my hope for my baptism with the "Bleus."
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we must show an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strictly, the players and encourages the to victory.
As it was Laurent Blanc.
But I would like to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal, he had qualified for the European Championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps "Bleus" will lead to Brazil.
Is that on 16 October in Spain forced draw (1:1) an opening the game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has campaigned for everyone else.
Before the meeting in Spain, I have never seen a similar game in my career.

Moreover, as so often happens in these technologies is a political vision: the belief that the current bank monopolies designed monetary system, leading to financial crises.
In fact, is that Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented Bitcoin both a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro convertible, etc.) as well as a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network has already covered some 200,000 transactions.
Several thousand websites Bitcoin accept a donation or payment.
After the course of Bitcoin in June 2011 a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to 2 dollars, before he has now recovered to around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly low prices compared to the world trade currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest.
Bitcoin describes as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to the conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that will be used to move forward in a video game, win or kupić through games (and sometimes) can.
The social networking site Facebook has developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin all network node of the accounting book depository, auditors at the same time, money, issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Every transaction between two users will take place in reality between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose for each payment to a different address, ensuring the anonymity.
A number of data relating to this transaction will be signed electronically by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins traded in the accounting book of the entire network of public accounts.
The crucial step is to sign this new transaction in this book.
This is a mathematical task, which will be run on computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege to add these additional line.
It is a carving up the file, the conversion of a large file in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computer ,"" the new transaction and add a number, before the whole thing "a."
The aim is to find the one number that a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found that can examine the other nodes, whether it is the right one.
The transaction is continuously linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If an user to pay for cheating twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money would only be validated by the network and the other remains one of the two transactions without linkage, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but up to a hundred millionth divisible, leaving a margin...
It also increases the difficulty of the task with any improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin, were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness is not the actual protocol," Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, a company to pay real money and uses the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering by means of this anonymous service.
But also cash these shortcomings.
Important players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they will be accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, the accounting book shows and that almost 80% of the Bitcoins in circulation.
A "mega sale" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company's Bitcoins Coin Abul, converted into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about the currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin validation of the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner's identity and therefore can remain anonymous.
The system can easily be implemented with the, and they do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to an address, photographed and identified by a telephone "can be," Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to be reconsidered in the hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It will take some time to prevail Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, the, the different, highly regarded today than to assess risks in the event of a success of this currency.

We are withdrawing from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are likely to be at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to decide their own future, without expecting anything from us.
We have to be punished, the Afghan farmers as, they are considered terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed and the injured and crippled.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, such as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their old and archaic traditions, even if they are jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
The latter will not be tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, as if the Western countries are discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab, I have observed with almond trees hills, was financed with the help of French loans, was carried out properly.
The countryside below helicopters, trucks and armored convoys have reached Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more preparation of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since her irresistible rise from 1994 to 1996.
Overrun Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups from the war.
Their power was seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the Al Qaeda organisation overpowered farmers, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and Taliban have a common desire to keep the women in a subordinate position.
The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war came to power in 2001.
They have turned into this racket property seized by the government, in order to sell them as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan and to benefit from the massive American subcontracting.
They have brought into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as those who were able to take advantage of the American contributions: the capital flight is considerable.
The young people have of the war and its ideology.
During their exile in Iran and Pakistan have had contact with the modern world, and have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
The state schools in the cities are full of boys and girls.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the parties to the corruption of certain executives, will have to make jobs available.
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones, television with his Turkish series, which is a modern world, everywhere.
An army is now available.
The authorities, under whose command they will be seen as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle already are trying to restore the militias in the province, which are beyond the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of the mountains with strong local identities should benefit from a degree of decentralisation in the Western nations, but the abolition of the office of the prime minister, which dated back to the constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make it a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai does not want foreign inspections, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country since the 50 s and long before dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have been Ailles functional storage facilities are not available and major irrigation system had been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables produced nothing.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country that has been directed by 30 years of war, would have been a state control of infrastructure.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had huge natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy, to process iron or copper ore on the spot, and without any means of transport for export over the mountains is not a mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) make their excavations at the vast Buddhist site and remain the major employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls and boys, Institute for French high schools of the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, has a service "civilian-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was closed in 2012, carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous charitable work and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture and carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in order to try to win the "hearts and minds" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for the many local workers were required to have can help to suppress the uprising:, irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
What we leave military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions that are often at a height of more than 2000 meters nearby valleys in these very hard.
In the message made dozens of written questions small agricultural projects of municipalities of the province Kapisa.
In order to get the farmers of the uprising, which is led by foreign groups according to their own statements they want, would be the continuation of low, well controlled and they directly relevant civilian aid in order to help them.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the constitutional declaration, which gives him unlimited power temporarily, more divided than ever, he has decided to put all our eggs in one basket.
To the surprise of all, he has announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will adopt the next day his final version.
The head of state had granted just a week ago this House two additional months to complete its work.
For almost two years now Egypt is based on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only for even greater division of the country.
For his opponents of the president in his "autocratic delirium," he continues to "breaking his word" and "the right underfoot."
On the side of his supporters are assured that there is a way, the institutional and political crisis to an end as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of, forcing the brothers to abandon their plans to explain the Egyptians the text section for section.
It is also a way for the president, to his public and democratic legitimacy, while protests raging across the country.
As you have heard in an interview with the American Wochenschau Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people will be charged with this recourse to a hasty vote an ultimatum: "Either agrees for my draft or I am the unlimited power," the latter should take after the adoption of the Constitution to an end.
85 mostly Islamist members of the constituent assembly approved the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have tended to move, because they believe that they are not able to express their views.
Representatives from human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have been equally.
To achieve the quorum were yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
The commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... The time has come for the prayer, because some members were of the opinion that the pendulum clock was not of the constituent assembly.
The text, which was adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, drew all the attention, after all, identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped, "the principles" by "the rules," which would have made a stronger application possible.
For the Islamists is the fact that this article has been amended, proof of their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" of the liberals, who see it as nothing more than propaganda.
The Islamisation of the Constitution via other articles.
They are especially Article 220, which grants the University of Al Azhar an advisory role, particularly in relation to the review of the compliance with the laws of Sharia.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier is worrying, because "the people who are being asked to give its opinion, have not been elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
You can see that the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university of should be much less moderate than the present.
"There is no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text, there are no Ulema, but academics, who have been trained in the French system, "appeased Alexis Blouet who wrote a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits, "that may be in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity, as are the terms used borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers in particular to the "fiqh," Islamic jurisprudence.].
And in the future could be raised the question of to what extent are competent civilian judges to decide. "
In addition to his criticism of the religious aspect of the text adopted yesterday sharply because of the far-reaching powers granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they are reduced compared with the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military will be submitted to the examination of the defence budget to Parliament, but a national defence council.
Just as there will be no ban on civilian trials in military courts, as demanded by the associations for the defence of human rights.
They also share their concerns with regard to the text, which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Moreover, no article refers more to the protection of women, Palestinian Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
They believe that the only positive point is the ban on torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to say on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the Head of State will march Saturday.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
And civil rights activist, about the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals with fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to make money for the upkeep of the remaining families home.
A law came into force on 1 December, according to which every migrant a test, the knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the local housing services and retail.
But the tests are to be transformed over time, according to migration authority for all migrant workers in the future.
It must not only language tests, but also tests in Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Language proficiency must be proved for and the the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian official language.
Also are exempt from this law, people who have received their training certificates and diplomas from the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Meaning, and protection of the rights issue
The whole of the inspection bodies is under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian language, the Russian University of the People, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants would be able to take the tests in all cities, have already been opened in Russia more than 160 such centres.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the members of the State Duma and the Federal immigration authority.
Human rights activists, however, before the entry into force of the law several times in the press the following question: What does it?
What changes does the legislation required to have language skills, both for the Russians and the guest workers?
Above all, to say the migration authority spokesman, is to reduce the number of forced labour.
"A lot of talk now about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
But their rights must be protected even before their departure.
Only an organized recruitment to 90% will solve the problems of foreign workers.
Run into problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that will face a future without knowledge of the language is necessarily bad people who, under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stayed with dozens of months without food and documents and will work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We are receiving many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home is promised you one thing, and on arrival you cheated to, their passports and do not receive the promised wage" the head of the main administration labour migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Not having a go, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to earn their money in Russia, that they do not only the language of the country, but also to express themselves in their own language, in writing.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a sound basic education.
Because their families are not even money to feed the children, let alone them decent clothes, shoes and buy school clothes.
These children then immediately as a teenager take the first opportunity for making money.
"It is difficult without language skills," they give.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say regarding the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, there is no investigation and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Entry for unauthorised persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
Moreover, the of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for a year and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents and we are not registered, and this gives rise to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow against journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers"
Earlier in the day when the law came into force, it turned out that not only can be falsified registration documents of migrants.
Some counterfeit certificates that the completion of the language tests, were beschlaggenommen by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The fake papers have been printed with a normal color printer.
This, of course, the new owners were not in vain: any migrant who hoped to be able to save the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant three thousand rubles.
That is the most important immediate task is to protect the system against corruption, so that we can't buy the certificates are simple, both officials and civil rights activist.
For the moment, the authorities can guest workers who fall for the first time the test, only promise that they have time for a course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered in areas where there is no active communication with people.

Interior Ministry ignored illegal arms market
Share of legal weapons to extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the arms bill for private gun owners.
The authorities in order to respond to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven people were killed in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri him.
The police do not want to ban the wearing of lethal weapons in the public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the changes to the arms law will be presented to the Duma.
Not all the problems are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight with "of the screws."
An open letter published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various armed groups - the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening."
The percentage of crimes with unregistered weapons is very low, the experts said, Vasiliy Lesni Primakov, the BBC Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes were committed with the use of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 offences were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that it will not prevent a tightening of the law for private gun owners criminals from serving on the black market.
Currently, according to the authors Fachschafts-Database in Moscow every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stressed that the proliferation of illegal weapons under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons come across multiple channels on the black market.
There are five such main channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Bara, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from the Russian officers and even now," says the.
On the second channel of illegal weapons, the cut are stolen by criminals.
The baranez explained that includes weapons that have been stolen from of the police as well as directly from employees of the law enforcement authorities.
Other weapons illegally trafficked weapons from military camps.
Many military camps often to explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases of arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military members.
To make a contribution to the black market in the arms manufacturers.
"Today there are countless private arms factories, not the international competition, and that is why the weapons in the hand on the black market, some in Moscow, dump," said the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Many pistols and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes small-scale production, as well as a Mafia, the organised smuggling," said the former military members.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated what percentage each of the five channels to supply the black market in illegal weapons.
In 2011, is a report by the Centre for problem analysis and public administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Interior Ministry and the Federal Office for National Statistics, forensic literature and publicly accessible data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal arms, according to investigators from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market were to go through the "guilt by leaders who came to do their work with weapons," the report states.
The data, the researchers estimated that 17% of the weapons from conflict zones, 14% goes to thefts in the weapons production, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a weapons shop, who did not want to be named, said that weapons that are found in illegal excavations, buys a long time, because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders to buy supplies in a weapons cache.
Gúolì Ensign is a weapon, for example, the TT, bought a gun.
The weapon will be issued and pass through the fence.
"The dealers brings the weapon in the city and they sold for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know about everything and is, therefore, of course, if they cannot comply with the plan for the detection of crime control, periodically purchases from merchants by offering illegal weapons," adds the sales consultant.
"As in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers find most about acquaintances.
I had seen websites and blogs, as someone attention on me, and I suggested to the station "Begowaja" to come, where would a person waiting for me that I would like to in a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the only weapon I learned there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"In order to make a weapon, I need a friend, the contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have a friend, but I do not trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go and with a code to "by Ivan міської Witsch who would wish that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am now even some key rings through a friend, whom I trust.
It also gives me the key rings only because he knows that I verpfeife.
Newcomers looking for weapons in various ways.
The former soldiers, Viktor Baranez tried in the mid-1990 s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on the subject.
The schemes have not changed according to him.
He was a photo album in which "everything possible" was shown.
"I felt like in the luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Écarté Bourguenez gets a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
I simply do not buy as a potential customer, but ride with the seller in the forest, and we are a target.
"I can shoot it there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," the expert in the.
Buy from your couch
Internet search engines display search results pages and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons "for different purposes."
It will not be any papers still needed there are personal meetings.
"They need just the right amount of money," says in the advertisement on the website "buy a gun or rifle."
Your orders to give users and ask questions.
Will also be sold to minors?
"Of course, without a license," asks users "Ivan" (I quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," says the question of "Fedorenkow laconic."
The Federal Security service, recently many bogus websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons abound, the service into the net.
The people are like hungry fish in feed and then end up in Siberia and coal digging
Military commentator and former soldiers, Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following way: the website is normally registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those who take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via a bank machine.
"In response he receives a photo and a description of the captivity of the weapon," says the press spokesman for the charity "Pravo na Dmitri Kislow oryzhie."
Viktor Baranez stresses that it finally empty and can be placed behind bars, if you put a question on a website.
The Federal Security service, recently many bogus websites, and buyers who want to acquire weapons abound, the service into the net.
"The people are like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in a Siberian labour camp and not digging coal," he says.
A Makarov for $100
When buying illegal firearms, according to the experts, with prices from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislow by the organisation "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun type Makarov for $100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a year and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military weapons camps of middle-ranking supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons across Russia in the period from January to October 2011, at 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices shrank by 7.8%.

In the U.S. strike fast food and supermarket workers
One in four American teenagers sitting somewhere behind the cash register at McDonald's
In recent days there have been all over the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yet no one can predict whether the protests will even further or whether they are out of the air again soon.
The protests are supported by unions and several leftist non-governmental organisations.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on so-called Black Friday, which took place in the United States sales turn the millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand mixtures.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, its work and Carnegie together with trade unions and left-wing activists branches of the chain, which targets individuals with low and middle income.
Walm kind sold all products, nappies on hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The commodity in the Walmart stores, on average, between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the paid Walmart employees buy only at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart, one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can sell the goods often so cheaply because the employees are paid poorly.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, such as lack of forklift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants in the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution to the company health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 a hour, could afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley, that if the company increased the average wage to 12 dollars a hour, it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
There are about 1.1% more than they pay now.
Would pass on Walmart wage increases to the customers, every purchase they cost only 46 cents more in the future.
They compared to today, which would be a year for additional expenditure of only 12.39 dollars.
Advocates of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only in nine states to protests, and brought them to the company any losses.
The Black Friday took in his shop on Thursday from 8 p.m. until midnight the next day, and during that period, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart cashier on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogel, who claimed in an interview on the website of the left-leaning Huffington post that "less than five" Walmart employees work, and the protest action is yet another "PR stunt," of the trade union, which organised the protests, and.
"Free money!"
The protests erupted this week in New York, where Walmart stores (which are not not in this progressive city, and so far non-existent), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the companies sell billions of chickens, and yet you are granted no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work.
Juma said Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage legislation under federal and New York at $7.25 a hour.
In fast food restaurants will gradually raise the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple employees in New York $8.90 a hour.
No one less than it deserves in this expensive city.
As it is possible to live in New York with so little money, is beyond me.
There was a time in which almost a quarter of all American young people after school at McDonald's stood behind the counter, but the young people were living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it is the main source of income or to stay there.
Now meet me in interviews with employees of McDonald's always people who complain that they have with this wage and sometimes even to feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the newspaper the Wall Street Journal, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if you don't know how it is to feed.
Participants in the protests, which on Thursday at 6,30 a.m. in front of the McDonald's began in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks of fast-food restaurants a minimum wage of $15 a hour, which is more than a doubling of the the current minimum wage.
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law prevents the management to stand in the way of this objective and union members to admonish or to dismiss.
On the other hand, does not make the management of them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is, but also for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unhappy
On this day, there were strident protests from many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including City Council member Juma said Williams, who said: "McDonald's said that it sell billions portions, and yet they'll be given no sick days, and you will not pay for your honest work."
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor Bill De Blasio candidate who said that "we should work together supporting the fast-food workers, so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve economic prosperity, deserves every New Yorker!."
According to the New York Times, this was the largest operation of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But there were only a few hundred people on the ground, far from all of them are employed in the fast-food industry, in the working in New York tens of thousands of.
It is not yet clear whether the spark will mobilise whole mass protests.

"The brain is so far the only moderately"
The supporters of modern technologies purveyors of the enlarged reality is perceived in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented at its annual conference in the summer a working model in November, was then announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3 D technologies in Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shah Ram Zhila, is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company's only a transit station.
The to manipulate virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and to create virtual free.
- Please describe your short, which operates research group.
- We are dealing with the interaction between man and machine, but want to extend the borders of this interaction.
So far has remained largely humanity at the, which works with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes affected.
But we want to look ahead 5-10 years, and predicted the radical changes this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors to progress, and today is no longer sold Xbox without, because all interested.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Even the interaction on a physical level, is still much on the flat screen, sometimes in 3 D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could not be improved, the crucial issue yet.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We must dismiss the computer world in our physical world and make it more.
To this end, it is necessary not only to the user, but also its surroundings.
Then we could add to the real world much easier through virtual objects.
And first and foremost, we should be this silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language?
It is popular, but they are not overvalued?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because they would like to inform all others about his actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in their particular niche.
For example, we were working in the field of objects in public places on a project in which we are short and tight, rather than experimenting with sweeping gestures.
These were not the gestures of the object camera, but from recorded by a bracelet that the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still relatively high, but in theory could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, however, such as the future belongs to mixed types of control, for example, gestures and language.
- Like this?
For example, we would ask you to reach out to you that Sprudeldose?
They say it and, at the same time.
Normally, I would say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to detect.
- That is, you want the user adjusts to what can't afford a machine at the time and what?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we in the near future, especially in the development of new types of sensors must be working that make it possible to collect responses from people.
Can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- What do you make claims based on your work with the Xbox, sensors on modern cameras?
There is a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, not 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
All current technologies are not good enough for us, the developers of the algorithms more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
Stephen Betis, developed in our laboratory in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction between man and machine.
I needed for my work as a device, only without the control and with more frames per second.
- The number of cameras should not be increased?
-, is currently working with three "cameras," which is one of them is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a recipient of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Nice is a flexible, similar system where we could play with different camera orientation, to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional identifying a position.
- If I remember correctly, not Microsoft, Google, in contrast to his public spectacles.
Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology in everyday life the enlarged reality glasses of the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant always on the to keep a smartphone in your hand, but I think the following: the best option would be a "temporary" enhanced reality in which we could switch on a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone.
The lens is a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (private, you can only see), but also its weakness, because an enlarged reality by means of glasses that you can work together with others in virtual objects.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also ordinary mortals.
There is a problem, often point to the critics of this idea: there is no visible reaction.
The hands feel nothing at all.
What answers to give your group at this point?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the enlarged reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough might well be the integration of taktilen perception.
An interesting method is the use of second hand as something unusual projection.
It takes pressure perfectly true!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed, in fact, the "pictures in the air" to give something concrete, for example, the interference by some of ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger, a feeling that is now so weak as someone einherjar over the control.
There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings in the fingers, this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outflank the brain?
We think that it can sense what it would feel if it sees something?
- This is a good idea, so we have not tried it yet.
Here is another challenge facing us is that we will have a long time, namely a person who is physically in a closed room, to believe that he is instead in an open, virtually infinite space, where we are working on plans with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can outwit only moderately, and we still have many busy years.
That is what makes the work in the field of virtual reality for researchers so attractive: many issues we are at the beginning.

My own taste rather than of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt project "Petersburg avant-garde" is dedicated to the city dwellers, which form the vanguard of the art and culture.
On the select list already landed high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes beyond the borders of the city and often find the recognition in Europe, without being in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, dressed in red clothed Bärtigen, the at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, found at scene meetings or at openings.
Where are the images of Kirill Miller, attract large crowds issued.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially philosophical artists, create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80 s or early 90 s.
It is also a man of the city and its presence on the street by his fellow citizens a smile in the face and provides them with good humour.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg hub organ player, because it is a difficult role in his artists, felt his philosophy and his image is finally ready.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the colour red as a fashion designer who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world is red the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the society calls on everything what differs somewhat from the grey norm, aggression and bad behaviour.
I want to come through my provocations with the people.
Any of my last provocation was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know that you have to be a painter?
- An exhibition in the Palace of Culture News Khoryv, which was my work.
I realised that I have to go down this path.
Then there was the time of the old free, but not officially recognised painter at the time, and new and free painter as I was incomprehensible.
I am friendly with the painters of the new generation, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; it "Pushkinskaya 10," and it was once.
The theater, fashion, music, in particular, in addition to the literature.
- And all the united in your clinic... It was important to me to be at the heart of Petersburg culture, where should gather the best new artist.
In 1995 I occupied a space in the Pushkinskaya 10 and there was up to the renovation a musically artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how cord with his project "Ucho Van Goga" visited it.
Cord and his friends sang simple songs for playback, wearing tight shirts and to them as was the hottest composer Igor Wdowin today.
As the group began to play live, was from the "Leningrad."
The mountain moderated many programmes before the time of "Halli Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the fundamentals he learned from us.
The gallery "D" or "137 club" Griboedov "have their origin in the the clinic.
Our employees and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, as a culture still meant something.
In 2000 there was a poll in the press, the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category "artist of the year," and I was reached at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times under old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: You can be famous, without having to make a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are true pearls and the timeliness and thoroughness of the idea.
I am an exhibition with the theme "the Russian Museum as clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier I was socially, but now it pains and is afraid to be so.
In all this a clown and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have bizarre ideas.
For example, we save the world by specifying that everyone has to dress up in full.
Everyone is now on the clothes and the exterior and the interior of the people.
But perhaps we should not be a human hand, but should he spit in the face.
The deception by dressing up.
Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have as a hero.
Who, if I fail?
- Commercial art can also be beautiful?
Today - must be careful commercial art, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of the cultures.
Earlier, the large groups of people: the bohemians loved one and the ordinary people.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a hundred dollar bill, which will please everyone.
Now you have to consider you, if you will.
Every cult star now has about 100 followers.
- In the presence of Stas Michał Ilow but several thousand!
- Come to him abandoned women, sexually plays a role in the social sphere.
For cultural reasons, 300 individuals and 10 thousand, so there is less money management, and everything is.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I have painted these pictures, which were in a collectors even in a number of the works of Falk and Lario Now.
I started with images that are usually only at the end of the career.
Today, there are often misunderstandings.
It says: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
This is the culture that I support.
- What is missing kirill Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: Diener- culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
In the real czar, it was different, because a lot of culture, but they understood that are perhaps not the right experts.
In Moscow, there are currently good advisers.
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be the experts, but they are blocked by the way, because it takes hochrangigerer experts, the former properly assess and pave the way for them.
Now, only one's own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they say honestly that they are not all contemporary art and therefore need to find some painters to adopt other museums.
- What is for you?
- St. Petersburg, the Capital of culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones can grow art is difficult.
We need a cultural ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many people who visit exhibitions and concerts.
We have a lot less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of St. Petersburg

Born in space
Earth at risk.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Of space ships carrying Erdbewohnern on the search for a replacement.
In order to save humanity, the important question of how we can reproduce in the weightlessness or the spare planet?
Many there is no choice in my opinion.
In fact, there are only two real planet, we could at least kādu hypothetical.
"Mars and Venus," says the scientific staff of the Astronomical Institute of Šternberk Vladimir Surdin.
While the conditions on Mars relatively enjoyable, on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, in space.
The researchers first dealt with the issue of reproduction in space on the flora.
A half-century earlier already carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the orbiting bred peas did not differ at all from the terraqueous species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It is becoming a normal chicks.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chicks themselves; it must be able to stand on its legs and start to move," said the laboratory director of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid underground chicks have been.
Ten hours later stumpften fully the instincts of the newborn.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
She died four days later.
"Twice we could slip chicks and did it, because it is simply impossible to work with them," Vladimir Sychew considers the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cages animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 will continue the experiments.
However, on the Biosatelliten "and" are only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that fertilized already have been sent into space.
In principle, there was nothing special.
"It was with the Biosatelliten again, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must continue," said Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats.
The issue of reproduction in space could be resolved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are taken from their natural habitat, simply cannot follow their reproductive behavior.
Unlike animals could in.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations are not carried out such experiments.
But women fly for 50 years.
The greatest risk in Tereshkova.
The Wertvollste with humanity, is the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on earth would they can answer the following question: Übersteht space flight?
This flight, will be able to bring a child into the world?
"Finally, no one answered that question," says space veteran Tang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The child's father, Jan Nikola, was also.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja who twice in orbit, and is even working outside the space vehicle, a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have only very few cosmonaut, where after long flights go well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poliakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet the human race for new ways in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydraulic laboratory in the cosmonaut training center is a compulsory station during the flight.
Here in limbo win the cosmonaut routine for work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Although adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a foreign environment, but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander testimony that rose from life on the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get easier to water.
In principle this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget something," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child is the weightlessness of a much more natural state, is not the woman without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles very quickly and so that is the ability to extract the child.
Okay, we deal with geburtseinleitende tools.
For example, the birth could take place in a special chamber in order to extract the child.
"But what happens then?" Is not the important issue of Valery Poliakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravitational pull of the organism can form the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child could not be put in orbit as an adult for training in a.
He is just missing what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment that we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will lead to a disabled person, a complete non-conformist will bring people to the world," says the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute for medical and biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space theory.
At some point it becomes reality, but if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, which is a home for their offspring born in space.

Nkú chief: control of the Black system through the fault of the failed policy
The Czech Republic, in the context of public contracts on good supervisory bodies and adequate laws, but in their application.
In the conversation for Aktuá ln.cz says that the Vice-President of the Supreme control office (Nejvyí kontrolní úad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be used correctly - and I think this is not the case with us," said of the current situation.
A similar result is to be a common control by Czech and German firms.
As bad practice on the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for so-called "Black system."
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would annoy the entrepreneurs with controls - so the system is banned or permitted?
"A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government's chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work," Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a common Czech / German project, the both countries "laws on public contracts.
What was it?
It is a parallel investigation, with which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is important that establishes the European legislative to handle public contracts to build the national legislations, and finally, there is the real practical application..
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet complete, we have seen very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws are perhaps a little "strict and perfect," but the actual application is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not new, and more detailed rules. We must deal with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project for you? What emerges from this project?
It is precisely this kind of joint control could help to stop us constantly to the laws and the reduction and balance of thresholds, if this did not seem particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) to buy and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the lowering of thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
It may even be that the system in this way, only the excessive burden "paperwork" and those who look for loopholes in the system, it is much easier to exploit the system, as if the threshold values higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
To as far as the authorities, the German counterpart the NKÚ the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar to us, and also on a college, which will be formed only slightly different. Basically, both authorities are similar.
The skills are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, a federal state, which means that there is also in the individual federal states - is the German system is different from ours.
The BRH can only monitor federal funding, which is our state funds.
Public funds is managed by the counties and municipalities, are subject to the control of the national courts of auditors.
As regards the German legislation is easier than ours?
In general I would compare it without specifics reluctant. Nevertheless Germany is in some ways, often described as a model, but say that Germany in particular is better.
That is because the auditors are better?
That is certainly not, but I don't particularly like, such comparisons.
It should be noted here that even those countries that have a model for us, are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to work with our authority, isn't it?
As regards the Czech legislation, your authority had the revision of the procurement law, do you feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only a short time in power, it is not yet in our tests.
As our controls, you have to be here with some delay.
Impact we feel in the preparatory phase of the future controls - we have the new instrument of control "detection of risks of inefficiency" and examined with this almost 14,000 public contracts and here, the changes will affect change, of course, the threshold values, modified the conditions for certain types of contracts, etc.
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or the system will be burdened with additional bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption.
It may occur, however, the problem is that the rules be "tough" and can no longer be met.
Under the previous rules are that they a Prfung underlined people against the carrier (for example, in the event of an operational programme of regional policy, the regional council) an are not accountable to any breach of the public procurement law a violation of budgetary discipline.
But it is to make the law more stringent?
I do not believe that in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not to punish those who have made a formal errors, which does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system, only the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where is the solution?
We say first of all, what is not the.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs would bother with controls of the so-called "Black system" - what does that mean exactly?
The system is banned or permitted?
A law must have valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then simply cannot come from the government's chairman, and the monitoring office, whose duty is the monitoring of compliance with the law, an obstacle in his work.
He can say: "we will change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do so, as if it were nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded due to procedural errors alone.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly - and that is what we are lacking.

Imon Ornest: our concerts we want positive energy gain
What do you think about the fact that is to take place in less than a month of the world?
This is one of those disasters, we human so to start up again.
With our band the T T do we tell us more about fun and that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
Also in December, an unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning two years.
To this end, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of December 21 is projected at 11:10.
The day before, on 20 December, from 21:00 p.m. at the same time, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts will be around at the time, on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us, the Mayan calendar ends.
Who is criticising this idea?
I was then, we have developed the idea, together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we do not want to collect only enough positive energy in order to prevent the world, but we also want to consider, together with the public about what state we this world Mimiola our children.
At the end of the Mayan calendar, we also have an unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key supporters against the world, can help with the purchase of www.e tap.cz people.
The band the T T, together with other performers also the so-called anthem against the world with the title "world comes from."
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. It will resound to the benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, provided that everything works and will not take place in the world...
The anthem to be sung by all actors at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition to the anthems live together in a direct connection from the Czech television.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, including Xindl X sings with...
How did you start working with two?
We also cooperate with other figures in the Czech cultural scene, which that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We are trying to these people hard in our projects.
It has transpired that are most interested in cooperating with us, and have fun.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts to benefit the world?
For the establishment of the accessible education center Studeo, on which we are already working together with the club six years T in Jedlika Institute.
The students of the Jedlika Institute are regularly by teachers who help them in different leisure activities.
As the students themselves do not have the resources to go to the, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlika Institute is intended to create a separate building, in which we move with this project.
At every concert several groups and performers.
According to what criteria you have chosen?
We wanted to put together a programme that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, China Yovkov enter support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The T T, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you on the website www.kpks.cz.
Similar "big events" are planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we are preparing an interesting programme with interesting guests.
Next year we want to be like in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the United States - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their overseas plans are not small, you already have occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The T T is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with these logistical and organisational trips?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. We also need to haul many instruments suitcase and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it always worked without problems, SA and British Airways were always prepared very well for us, that I have sometimes surprised some.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign trips you have to compare the situation in the various countries with, as there are people with disabilities, etc.
As you have seen these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we were witnessing in Russia in the East, that is still in its infancy.
To Prague, Moscow is not totally disabled, where it is still unusual, if someone is in a wheelchair in the city centre.
It is not yet, of course, that vorlässt a wheelchair users, for example, in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are also clubs that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are many things on which we depend on...
It should be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation of the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal for people with severe disabilities self-cut move in public space, go to the museum can use toilets etc.
But it is not usual that actively participates in a larger group of disabled people in the public arena, we are with the band the T T slightly ahead of the West.
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own worldleading athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, are things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly determined personalities.
The T T is currently very popular. But if we go back a couple of years: What was your motivation in 1998 to get a band?
Then I began as a supervisor in the Jedlika Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in dealing with something.
And since I myself am musicians and, together with a colleague, I have a music AG.
Oh, and over time, as the moderator, Láa Angelovi, likes to say, a little out of control (laughs).
The band became known in recent years, would you?
It is true that the cooperation with well-known singers helped us, and we have started to campaign actively for us.
We are discovering that if something does not work and this is externally, there is no merit in a sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also be good editors, quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to make it with The T T?
From the beginning, I felt the potential that we can do things differently.
In show business today often copied to the other.
This is logical, because its own way everything new with caution and is accepted only after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I would venture to say that T T.
The first impression that the audience usually has, of course, is a pity; it is only natural.
But this compassion is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not isolated and abandoned, we should regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities something, not just for them is a step forward, but for the whole of society.
It was also helpful for this success, that you are a tough boss, as we hear from many people?
If you want to make something good, we must make no compromises on many things, and we should also ask for a certain discipline.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some people come to us with romantic ideas, and when they realise they have twice a week, must undertake preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm among many quickly extinguished.
So it works everywhere, in every band who do the work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The T T twenty members.
How many of them from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láa Angelovi.
We are an open group. People come and go, that cannot prevent.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join, is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the world, Thursday predicted the 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
Venues inch Eba Arena / Fléda / Prague, Brno and Ostrava; 12 Plynojem / Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will conclude by live and it sounds a common interpretation of the anthem "world," the band the T T.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the of a multifunctional disabled education center that is to be created under the name STUDEO in Jedlika Institute in Prague. CZK 25 million.
The entry costs 400 CZK, children until 12 years free of charge cards are available in Bohemia Ticket.

Poland and the space.
Poland was admitted last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member States of the European space Agency (ESA) as a member of this space easy authority. Poland is the second member country of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which took place on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began in 1994 and participated in a close cooperation with the European Space Agency ESA projects in the next several years.
The path of Poland into space, however, began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War II Polish space enthusiasts with the space, and they were not always understanding.
I remember of the lecture by A. ternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw, which the author thought from his pioneering work "entrance to the cosmonautics."
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) but the audience cold, and after years ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had only shown interest in his work.
Ternfeld won in 1934 for "entrance to the cosmonautics" by Robert Esnault Pelttari and André Louis Hirsch, Prix REPS Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was an important supporter of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognized contribution to the development of the space has been acknowledged by, among other things, that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
In 1925 was built in Poland a railway trolley, which was planned for a rocket engine.
The author of the draft, and the details of this project have unfortunately been unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or the brakes of the trolley.
The information can come only from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry, with raketenbetriebenen purpose-as began.
The research, the Institute Komórka Tech Niki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents show that the research was down to the stage of practical tests.
But the research was then interrupted by the invading German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, in the press of. Rohoziski originating draft photoelectric hunting rocket, and the following year, he joined the "raki 生Eta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealing with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology from passing scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, after two years of work has been finished his work by the beginning of the war.
Another article on space appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish aerospace company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company is 1954 in the November issue of the journal Problemy, in the four major articles of the space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to a space company.
At the time there was the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that would have the space exploration future.
Even at its inception in 1956, the Polish space Society PTA membership based on the 1951 International Federation for space, and indeed, the PTA in autumn 1956 member.
The following year was the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy chairman of the International Federation for space.
This post he held until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA took part in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (raki Eta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, 1, was completed in 1957, the first race took place on 10 October 1958.
The missile with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was 80 cm long and weighed just 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the brillantes 1 A, built, and 1959 in the Bledowska Desert flight tests began with the two-stage rocket más brillantes 2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should be able to make real scientific work - the rocket más brillantes 34 should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, but, has been halted further development.
Successor to the first missiles of the type RM was developed in the years 1962 to 1965 Meteor- 1 rocket.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, its total length of 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
From this developed three types (Meteor- 1 A, 1 B and - 1 C), which manifested in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor- 1 a rocket had a room with 0.4 litres capacity, Meteor- 1 B 0.34 litre and Meteor- 1 C for 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types of 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 was developed in the aviation institute which Meteor- 2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor- 2 has a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg in a height of about 60 km.
After the versions were built Meteor- 2 H and Meteor- 3.
Also worth mentioning is the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR Committee.
Poland participated in the framework of the cosmos programme in space research with Soviet satellite, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Hermaszewski current legislation after the Czechs second interwetten cosmonaut Vladimir Remek.

The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court of the law on charitable work.
That decision provoked a lively debate among the public.
It is interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
"The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In effect, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.
The this is the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with rampant financial speculation.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) leads to price.
It is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying to compete with cheaper imported goods in economic competition, by undercutting the competition "" in order to grab a larger market share and to increase its profits.
This means on a large scale for most companies to move their production abroad or buy cheap, or give up their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with high labour costs.
Because private capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for what he is necessarily caused unemployment, rising government spending.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the two entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and the damage they have caused overall economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the level of social security of its own people and to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words: governments provide their own people without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of the private sector, particularly in the field of wages.
This is done through economic coercion in long-term unemployment, partly by reducing workers "rights.
The result is increased poverty and widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there have been several years since public food outlets for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
As a result of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy is regularly to cases where workers receive a salary so low that the state must increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also in the case of the German Bundestag revealed auxiliaries.
The austerity measures virtually all the EU southern states will no doubt be on the same condition, which people are being forced under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels, to emigrate (as in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the margins of society and hope that at some private investment capital flow into the country.
Here, the question naturally arises as to how this capital?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa at all for a fraction of the European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media ad nauseam claim that the state must not be involved with capital in its own economy, and that a planned economy to economic disaster.
Private capital narrowly insists on his position that the state should not intervene to direct the economy.
Then you have to wonder whether the policy does not affect private capital and the entire state in their own selfish interests or draws.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual benefit, legislation in virtually anything criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the reality is that a State Department for lack of finances private, with the industry of legal businesses with the drafting of legislative proposals.
This legislation is passed in the Bundestag.
All violence is no longer the people from the western constitutions, as, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are currently a situation that Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar's and "describes:" the state has been understood for a long time in the, and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, illegal or fraudulent use of benefits with stone and sword.
Corruption has grown unchecked, and the people with boughted votes went to the polls ..."" people with character not applied for posts as a result of this decline for eight months, so that the state had no consul ..."" You really began to talk about it, that is the only medicine an autocracy in this difficult situation, and that a strong man ..." Appian thought is to be in, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, democracy permanently replaced by the autocracy.
As it turns out, is today's society, as well as in ancient times based on of the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without looking at overall societal interests.
Private capital by its very nature, is not in a position to see the benefit of society as a whole.
The result, now, as then, is an unparalleled decadence of the elites, who are not in the slightest for deeper reforms.
The cause for the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the indiscriminate liberalisation of of the economies in the 19th and 20th century look.
Of the, the regime in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, in the next round.
Especially appalling is the fact that today's elites in the future potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we are today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know it from the older and more recent history, in complete ignorance.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work is no solution, at least not lasting.
Under pressure from the global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the level of social security of the population.
This trend is a systemic nature.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
..." that there is nothing that could arise from violence or Sting sings in the song" fragile, the most ever chorus: ..." so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons were no wars, there would be no," says the dying Gutele continuity Schnaper, wife of Mayer Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there were a host of reactions.
The there are those who stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the others support the Palestinians, to argue with the racism of the State of Israel, with to the Palestinian Arabs committed genocide and the State of Israel as a terrorist.
At this point I don't to write about who is in these recurring waves of killing someone who is guilty and who ultimately victims; the today's inhabitants of Israel including the self-rule territories in the current political situation, and have not seen the start of the violence.
My concern is to give readers a look behind the scenes, look who's 95 years of tension (from Balfour declaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East in particular.
My thoughts are based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from this and go from my own understanding of who or what group of people affected by the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can see an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether they really were always those people themselves, of their autonomy, or whether someone was behind her throne, who drew their actions on a vorbestimmtes goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the life span of a generation.
Under these astronomical is a particularly rich families, which could be described as head of the octopus (I do not know if there is someone above them, but I do not rule out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
It is understandable.
The first (Reuters press agency) was of the Rothschilds already in the 90 s of the 19th century, bought in order to prevent the linking its name with hochkriminellen deeds, in the context of the consolidation of its power, the propagation of their assets, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or equip themselves to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, but in the meantime, the central Bank of Russia's government has).
Anyone who has ever tried to oppose this family, had to pay with their lives for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschilds as central Bank, Bank of America during the civil war began to issue their own (read: official) notes and was murdered in 1865 in a theatre.
J.f. Kennedy, began to issue their own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve - he was assassinated in 1963; Mr Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936, after the Fed wanted to sue for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global appetite for power of the Rothschilds, in the years 1859 - 1871 to formulate a plan to free up three world wars by Albert Masonic spades, an of the 33th and the highest degree of recognition.
The first war aimed to eliminate the big royalist states, Europe should be broken by the second war, in particular Britain's colonial rule, and the third war to reduce the world's population to around 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their amenities and luxury and would not use so many resources), create an universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families is working with the Rothschilds at the head, triggering a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (or from chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve, so that crises like the one of them in 1907 triggered repeat).
After it was managed by the murder of the Hapsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, triggering World War I, they destroyed the Russian empire by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World war ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Tsar's empire the war was not necessary), then the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria.
In order to be able to the Second World war, the bankers by the policy could create a latent conflict situation by Germany with huge war reparations, which they created the condition of impoverished masses, so they had to only palming the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who named the guilty, and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should be the function of a fifth column, and also played in order to the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in a branch of the establishment of a Jewish state, as turned on the historic area with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second world War broke out, and whether Hitler, ran aground off the chain, which it initially had kept the international bankers, or whether everything has gone according to plan, it is difficult to assess, in any event, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, was to the, as well as by the war reparations from Germany for the Second World war, the creation of the state of Israel, the creation of the focal point for the third World war.
If we will be in the international bankers to unleash this war, the Jewish people victims of the Second World war II in the front line of battle, this time together with the Arab and Muslim population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply divided the people of Israel's supporters and opponents).
Who is the guilty party and who the victims in the conflict between Palestinians and Vojeans Israelites, where it is wrong in an endless cycle of violence, which was at the beginning of the greed and their quest for global power?
We must differentiate between the people of Israel and its leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as for us, the people, only their own candidates for election.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu, the hawk, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal devoted politician who does everything to spark a war with Iran, which, in the of Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and because of the Iran's control over only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of global oil supplies, could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of the words of David Rockefellers in 1994: "the only thing we need is an across-the-board crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In its presentation of the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted in the birth of a chip to submit this system of total control.
"And it is that the kids and the Great, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants of a malt oak give their right hand or in their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, he was because, namely the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, who has, consider the number of the animal.
Because it is a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. "

The film Argo: When's the worst that Hollywood call
In November 1979, a mob demonstrating Islamist students occupied the American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They called for the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled for their release after the revolution in the United States, which for decades had maintained the patronage of his regime.
For the American Government out of this situation, there was no positive way - she could not afford to throw the Shah, as this would have damaged the confidence of their allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was not in a position in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt by the hostage liberation made it even worse.
The diplomats were released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages home a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film, the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the U.S. a small part of victory.
Just before the occupation of the embassy six embassy staff were able to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; it helped them an extravagant story for covering up their true identity - they with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film, which allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The experts for "Exfiltration," Tony Mendez, developed plan, Hollywood's cooperation.
This was the camouflage credible, published articles about this film project in journals, there were held press conferences, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is an unique combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but also a so-called "Aquascapers Movie" is, the story of a successful job, such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This change in the film's mood levels - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence showing iconic contemporary photographs, and also in the film version of the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, therefore, the ironic and slightly exaggerate.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, the official corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck succeeded with this film a remarkable start to his career.
From a belächelten actor has become a respected director, and also as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film in the no children (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is Afflecks first film, which is not in the local Boston by director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that contrasted this director's previous films from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck demonstrates this sense but also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events that have taken place - the main sequence of the storming of the embassy in its clarity is very impressive, and it conveys the sense of confusion and the unpredictability that occurs when signalizations moves the story.
A similar effect Affleck and his team also in fictional scenes (the wrong film crew at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much plot in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many exciting scenes in cinematic terms.
But he working with the little, but sometimes he nachhilft reality - which is not always so elegantly (the scenes in which will avert the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America, or the chase on the runway, the most fun).
The weakness of Argo is his overly broad distribution, which is due to the need to show too much to act in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, their figures but deserved more space, but they are in the film is far from alone.
Afflecks film loses a little traction. It is a movie, with some interest, and the design and the age of a thriller from 70 to approve years. Without style.
However, he awakens enthusiasm.
Until today in some way as a reminder of a living piece of history and as proof of how excessive but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services, but it is enough.

Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, an annual survey on the oddest bank charges, has decided to this year, the most absurd thing regulation or idea from the EU "workshop."
"This idea brought us the recently put forward by the EU plan to introduce a quota of 40% in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares about the organisation of the poll, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the Court of Justice on the harmonisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they are for the insurance companies objectively less risk.
"Another incredible incursions from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013, "said Nacher.
On the controversial EU regulations include the mandatory blending of bioethanol to petrol, which is in its wake naturschädigend, the ban on the mercury thermometer, just because they include a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on size of chicken cages, because of the eggs this year were much more expensive.
Criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even a ban on the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Bananas are 14 cm long
The EU machine often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby for trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels in the rule of one or more Member States (the Czech Republic, for example, is trying to push through the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
Lobbying interests were also behind that bananas must be the highest in the EU trade class at least 14 cm long and no "curvature anomaly."
The European Commission defended with the argument that they harmonisiere only the fragmented national standards that would impede trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables by the EU against the resistance of some countries already have been undermined by pointing out that the existing directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is perhaps the EU regulation last year, which must be provided in accordance with balloons in the sale by saying that children under eight years not inflate the balloon without supervision of an adult.
The EU, citing an American study, which in accordance with balloons are the leading cause of death of children.
A similar restriction applies for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious ideas at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive, which concerns the European officials - anyone who has an official function in the EU, must not because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead use the name Macedonia, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovní poplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists laissez-faire in addition to the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies to the territory of a member country.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of food supplies, which could be on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic crossed then set for canned mushrooms, which we threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for them, that they have no sea, or from the idea to give grants for applications for funding.
These ideas but did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will be asking for a refund from the EU, "said in the autumn of 2004, the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (SSD).
The argument put forward is that the grain harvest is very high, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases were overcrowded government camps.
The Czech Republic to sea ports have another way, the EU should according to Palas paying hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission, the Czech Republic so far that they organised a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Funding for applications for grants offered communities the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US DEU), specifically, it has to be funds for the establishment of aid money requests to Brussels.
EU: bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the Member States easy target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and, hence, efficiency and development of the entire European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more recognition.
A serious problem, according to these experts are more the EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but they were in the budget negotiations by individual Member States.
Emotions here also calls on the fact that the Czech Republic must fight like other member countries in Brussels about the right to use specific names of traditional products and don't win this fight it.
The Czech Republic was able to do so after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the national rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us until the 19th century, but had to our manufacturers in Germany, "Tuzemák."
The designation "rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distil, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU are appearing in the company of the world-famous feta cheese, gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, carp from Pohoelice and now Karlovy Vary, or even the Žatec hops.
With an EU trademark can boast the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hoicer roles.

"The people that I want to save the Republic, but I am just an amateur," said Okamura.
Mr Senator, how to get the idea to run for the presidency?
It is not about me, senator or president.
If everything would work in our country without problems, I would run anywhere.
But I can no longer look at how plundered the Republic for 20 years, as thieves, while increasing people's taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something that I do not like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And while I am over 40, and independent and party-less, I have no other way to influence things, a senator or presidential candidate.
In the Senate, you have made it and then straight on the road to the castle.
You do not turn our backs on your constituents?
I told me the whole time that I will take the fight to for the castle on the outcome of the Senate elections.
This later clarified and I said that I will run for the presidency, if I am elected senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my vision.
I need as much influence as possible and a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we, as people in the pub and in front of the television, but anyone who wants to change something.
To confuse then there are the media who want to the, and to lie with the freedom of speech and freedom.
About me, it was said, for example, that I would impress journalists or that I was an adviser by Jiří Paroubek.
We talk about your vision.
The struggle for the castle you have included with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians, as well as with retrospective asset declarations about 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have endeavoured to keep the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, that's not on purpose, and that keeps the population only.
As an independent party, I have a much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in parliament.
My advantage is that I can take without drawers thinking and party dogma of each party what is the best for our country.
You see as a person in the policy right or left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people see more on the left.
For me, this left-right thinking but totally irrelevant.
For me, it is important that we make progress.
My point is not whether people on the left or the right, I would like to unite the people.
I always support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSM or the ODS, and even so will I go against bad ideas.
It you, if someone calls you as populists.
But do not confirm it by what you have just said?
If you add in a company a business plan, then you have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that you want to move.
You can call it as far as populism, but all the proposals, which I have spoken to work in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament telepad remain just slogans.
And so that you are not in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that you, if you talk long enough with the people will be able, for example, the material and impose criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and to convince the public and to try to bring them to our side, to achieve these goals.
As president, it would be no problem for me to ask the chairman of the parliamentary parties on live TV to the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the home-owners may then have to say why they reject.
A strong personality, which refers to irregularities, can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the President, who was a credit to the public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur and I am neither a genius nor an intellectuals.
I am trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I started with the policy and just trying to find my programme for the support of the majority.
I always try to assess the situation for themselves; and if it doesn't work, then I am in six years in the private sector.
That sounds a little, as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I do not alone, and that is why I have spoken with several famous people on whether they want to run for the Senate.
For example, I have spoken with Radim Janura, but rejected due to.
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who exposed the fraud in the sale of light fuel oil.
My candidacy, I began with the assumption that people are deeply unhappy, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of voters have not gone to the polls, and those who have gone, mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
The people have chosen such a Senate composition that will be very difficult to implement changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about setting up your own party?
I have not thought about it, because I don't have the time to review the past every potential party member, and not have the money.
I have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account for only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
You talk about asset declarations, what would you?
I appreciate my private assets to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Kodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And and then I have a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin was a child's dream - James Bond has always liked me, as he was driving in the car, gallantly to women, and fighting against evil.
You are driving an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the Republic, but you do not want to invest your own money.
That is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I do about debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that the my program probably does not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to make the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign will gedecktVVPP basically through my salary as a senator.
But the senators salary, I could not live alone; I could not fund my son the English school, which costs Euro30,000 per month.
If I wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
Stay as long as an entrepreneur, to have your livelihood?
You said that you will return these activities?
But that does not depend on the level of salary.
As promised, I have reduced my activities.
For example, is my deputy CEO of the travel agents in the spring,.
The people want to see me as a Samaritan, saving the republic.
But I have to live by.
Monthly income you were used as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and it remains so.
As president, I would stop my.

Proving MVRDV architects that is not only the real adventure in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the newly-created books mountain - 2 photos
"I think the building, it looks futuristic, and finally it is to see something interesting," said Lisette, Aig, a roadside Passantin.
And Stefan Spermon, it technicians in a nearby big business, says: "But, it is beautiful, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one is voluntarily today in one of these Old Style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige sleeping city on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The of 80,000 inhabitants, the lowest rate throughout the Netherlands.
To counter this stupid thing, it was decided a few years ago, to contribute to the general education and the seven fictional bridges that are displayed on the euro notes, as emulate nicely bepinselte concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to deal with the Mehmed-pasha Mr: a library needs.
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, master of tollkühnen beam charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took up the matter with his usual composure and appeared for the hearing on competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury is still out looked nonplussed, and jerked nonchalantly esspecially the cheeky Maas exquisite souvenirs of the size of a pyramid and ended his speech aktionistisch reinforced with the words: "Love municipality!"
It is, therefore, my proposal for the mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the of EUR 30 million.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also underground car park, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the books with the second prize awarded "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is not the faceless small-town retort, which until now had to offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunned ugly town hall, behind the of white façades inclined to suspect a dairy factory, a piece of contemporary architecture.
But above all Spijkenisse, on the first public cultural construction in the history of its existence.
The long road to book
The first impression: books El Dorado under glass.
There is a lift which leads halfway through the hills, but the real space and reading tap the fußläufigen climbing the topography.
The Sonnenalm glazed interior is bright and clear, the soil and the elegant street lamps unambiguously speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
It is already looking for parking Bank, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books.
"Normally the bookshelves along the facade, and a big, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have made the classic room configuration on the head and put the reading area from inside out.
The interior of the books ," is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, Schachclub, environmental centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A special pleasure are the black bookshelves, which, are the.
Look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and engineers shake whether use of the unknown.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," said Joop Trou Borst, project manager for the city of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we came up one day in a friesländischen agricultural business on a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields a millimeterdünnes plastic fleece as root.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds one or two, then it is ready for the rubbish bins.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in this volume - forced to four centimetres thick plates.
Under heat and pressure of the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that smells a little for new cars and a little after athletic footwear.
After 105 stages has reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long travels in literature café is not only a fantastic prospect of the city, but also rewarded with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all for the right humidity in literature.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe it, but this house is in spite of the many glass surfaces a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trou Borst.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the books mountain under a glass fall, the sun is shining even on sunny days only briefly to the interior.
The wide, which is right across the glass façade, serve as shading and much of the sun.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest do fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT industry, already ventured into the new library.
Even Lisette, Aig was already there.
And the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, the Boekenberg even as Spijkenisses "long-overdue soul."
The reason: In the opening of a few weeks ago, everyone was invited residents to donate a book from his personal collection.
It is not yet again the optical gaps in the fully stocked library - currently 70,000 - will be filled.
The idea has taken root.
The shelves are filled absolutely fed up.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think everyone now thanks to our invitation, has residents of a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
And if it is just an ornament.
This is the King discipline that MVRDV called in the jargon identity.
Spijkenisse wrote literary history.
So young and uneducated they may be.
Finally, this is a starting point for identity.

Szabo: "Germans must play bigger role."
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S. European relations, Berlin poised on a narrow diplomatic level.
German first wave: Germany earlier this week had indicated that it would vote against the request for observer status for Palestinians at the beginning of the United Nations.
But then abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now must be Germany due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote, when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was enforced by NATO.
Germany is finding it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
That is because it is surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, as it were, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, that Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
So the Germans find themselves trapped in the middle.
It is expected them that they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to.
I think that they their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions in on national interests, which are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike the other major powers and therefore needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have had an impact on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
We must be careful, the public, but also the elites, not to in the Arab countries.
It definitely plays a role.
But I would not want to give too much weight, it is not a totally one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Germany has damaged its relations with the United States, by abstaining from the vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe in Europe and even in the United States, there is a lot of sympathy for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic breakthrough, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will record a certain respect.
Because it signals that it will be taken seriously as an international player and must be given to its interests.
In Europe there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States have come out clearly in favour of a veto.
There are differences between the U.S. and many European nations?
As a result of American domestic politics have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly quite a lot of sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation, the government can not this position publicly, of course.
I believe that the real differences are not as great as they appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not at all talking about Netanyahu's policies.
It is difficult to Germany's close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
I think that this is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a wider line and must instead push things from their own position.
This is precisely what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take a leading role in the future to push Europe into an European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans know that they must play a more independent role.
Germany sees itself in the role as an important international player - Germany wants to play a major role?
Germany is still the lead or difficult?
Germany is still not yet been used, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always hard to play a greater role in the country.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time Germany takes a greater role, various anti- German feelings.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
This is the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is seen in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive to a variety of neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States continually in European politics, the EU does not fill the vacuum at the moment but who is?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like, it makes them uncomfortable and it is even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese.
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what Armani Polo?
A designation officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the original company.
However, as long as it enjoys protection, the actual name donors do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas stalemate hole, a lawyer in the law firm Taylor Wessing, which is in the Far East.
A new case every week ends up on my desk.
The clones are already a few extra letters, so that they can register their brands.
So Gucci, Prada gives simply Lu Gucci, Prada Kny you enter.
German companies are legally copied in this way, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a folder with the of the trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protecting the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that used at the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The Chinese world champion in the copying and injured intellectual property, is well known.
In the big cities, there are mehrstöckige department stores that sell almost exclusively.
But the cases are different: his clients he goes against that Chinese companies receive officially have from the Trademark Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "bang Jian-Ming Pai," a passenger.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
Women who rich men.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt
"That is, we must fight will jeopardize it," says stalemate.
"The brand will, the lone position, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the cost of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA is China, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
But deletions dubious trademark registry entries are hard to reach and go into money.
The process can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Stalemate hole reported cases in which the court lawsuit claims, because after the long duration of the disputed name to "market reality."
If the plaintiff have bad luck, he would have to pay the Plagiator even money because he injured his brand in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer GGR, a company that recently took over the German concrete pump maker cleaning.
To date, the Chinese must therefore use a logo similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyers Geely originally used a blue and white logo which recalled BMW; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The fashion maker Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are aware of no guilt.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is that there have been 2010 due to lower personnel and equipment shortages.
But last year was one of the "emergency in the workflow returned to normality."
As part unbearbeiteter appeals procedure had fallen by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office still 81,500 appeals on completion.
On the other hand, to address costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, when CTMO went more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is the tenth consecutive year, a record and that give China the list of applications around the world, shares the authority.
This also applies to the of all the valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 had been taken over 1.8 billion yuan in fees.
Put simply, this means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
The fight against costs several times, as in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans have been able to do that was dug its illegal manufacturing imitation of motor vehicle parts.
But secured the Chinese rights to the brand of.
You did not do so, because it could not be protected in Germany family name, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Board of Management of Freudenberg Chemical depending in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was right, but the process opponents fighting.
We must use extreme caution
The matter is now before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely complex and is costing us a lot of time, money and nervous."
The internal cost could be difficult to quantify, the company's archive had to look arcives even one hundred years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, a "high six-figure euro amount" in Freudenberg the other side to settlement.
"This shows how much it is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe.
Then, if there territory.What Doubles vulnerable brands.
As a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business has long since abandoned the group, but he could avert the registration.
"We must use extreme caution," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer stalemate hole advising German companies to be very careful in dealings with China.
It is not enough to rely on international brands, but the foreigners "everything is somehow worth protecting, but also in China," says Wentzler.
Otherwise, much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg last act of his trademark drama, then you would have to pay the other side licence fees for their own name, said Wentzler.
Or we are in the segment of the market.

World Aids Day: Warstomp, sing, help
In the chorus Imbongi - and AIDS orphans in Swaziland are happy.
The story of a link to overcome far more than 8733 kilometres.
First there is the last: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies and gentlemen slippers on the parquet floor looking for the cycle, find him quickly.
One two three four.
Only then the voices of the singers, slowly - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano - press, and.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost from its plastic shoes, if it brings them with its sleek wild gestures.
It is Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi a new song.
The fifty singers have come between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics Edukacji man.
"Om" Obani "is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and this in a very foreign language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland and parts of it.
Self-help
Worldwide there are about 34 million people infected with HIV, the Unaids estimates that the program of the United Nations to sound of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
There are 245000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitjeni has found the association Voices for Africa, in Germany.
70 of them attending secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, uniforms and a hot meal every day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means to Zulu storyteller or Lobpreiser.
The can speak Bantu language fluently but nobody in this room, sing.
For nearly ten years, the chorus songs in this strange soft language and brings them and back to where they originally come from: in South Africa.
Because only 8 733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni that depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, most of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they have succumbed to the virus.
In Esitjeni small foretaste of what is in, a Swaziland: high HIV infection rate, lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of contagion by half, will be accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of the people of Swaziland meet the immunodeficiency virus to die with thirty is not uncommon.
In a joint Africa trip in the spring of 2005 the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, which not only lack of parental responsibility, but simply of of everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school in a poor country certainly no chance.
Initially, it was still a private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros per year and make him a hot meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa," which looks almost professionally since the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI, HIV, Humane Pappilomaviren, herpes is both an or hepatitis.
The web lice and itch belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main victims groups?
Syphilis and Tripper mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five of all in Germany reported syphilis cases transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults are chlamydia infections, success (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively small - yet: 20 percent of HIV infections in this group.
Chlamydia infections among young people are much more frequent than other groups.
According to European surveys three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Here are often also Humane Pappilomaviren among young people.
As the number of infections has developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to more than 3698 illnesses in 2011.
The number of HIV infections, since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can ulcers in the genital area, in the, pain and blisters or warts.
But often they cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but does not offer complete protection.
Sexually transmitted diseases partly because it can be transferred by lubricating infections and close physical contact.
, experts recommend especially promiscuous Sexpartnern regular check-ups.
Early can be cured most diagnosed STI and avoid long-term consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the fee, the choir's ersingt throughout Germany, something comes along.
"We have sent a total of around 200 000 euros after Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself managed Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman who from Germany.
It is also cares about the orphans, in one of the grandmothers as well.
The Gogos, as it is called the old women in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their head and make sure that the children in their uniforms every day on time school.
Anyone who has any more, comes into the house to Khanyisile protection, a single woman who is paid by the club as much as the two cooks cook every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, "Voices for Africa" a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organised jointly with the American Health Organisation PSI that many in the village have a HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because it is so that the disease across the country, it is dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Strange in a country where the king officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy rather than democracy.
Among other things, it is due to officially sanctioned way of life that has spread of the in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus around the country.
Free condoms every corner, Annette Lennartz says, "but the rarely used.
The culture is different - Flesh to Flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir every two or three years, together with the South Africa and sings songs full of, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many on the southern tip of the black continent still of apartheid.
A bus full of white, singing the songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but also has minor some fierce border guards a few tears.
The trip also leads to Esitjeni, where visit the singer's godchildren.
Even if the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river, it is more than familiar.
"After Esitjeni, as is the light" tell the people there.
And if you return the 8733 kilometres to the to Heidelberg, the pounding singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shine.

Messenger: NASA ice discovered on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice should be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
He is closest to the sun, there are frozen water, as well as from three studies published in the journal "Science" on Thursday.
The probe Messenger have found evidence that there is the region of the planet permanently in the shadow of ice.
This is supposed to be at least 30 cm and perhaps even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that may also have taken on the Mercury.
The discovery of ice but linked to with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help clarify how have water and other building blocks of life in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the world's citizens are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, to explore the depths of the space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: small in.
The image comes from a camera, the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond Neptune, is Ceres under the new definition of the International Astronomical Union 2006 is not a "planet."
This image cutting an infrared absorption of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless stars generations: the oldest stars are visible as blue dots, are harder to identify the pink "newborn" in the circle of stars.
This sternenbildende region raged - very unromantic - called by scientists has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the stars Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This colorful glow of a dying star has included the Spitzer telescope of Nasa.
The Donut dip ring consists of material that herausschleuderte the star in the process.
In the huge Trifid fog, 5400 light years from Earth, caused by gas and dust new stars.
The Spitzer telescope of Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth.
The Pleijades star clusters, including "the Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
However, the colors better with the telescope.
But Age looks like a red in this infrared picture the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to a continent brought this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and spread-spectrum photo provides for spectacular colour.
This baby star could be included in its full beauty by the Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how this came about, is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Maybe they are the remains of a Saturn moon, who disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and strongest pictures of the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color of spiral galaxies to be works of art.
The European Southern Observatory, shows the several thousand light years away Trifid fog in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (divided into three sections, dreigespalten), dreiteilen as dark dust, the fiery heart of the star's birthplace.
In our own galaxy, astronomers have photographed harbingers of a cosmic Karambolage: 400 million light years from Earth hurtling the cores of two verschmelzender galaxies collide and will inevitably collide with each other.
These stars are born of the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
As for those who are not technical abbreviations, which may call them by their nickname Southern fire.
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a portion of the Iris Nebula in the star image Kepheus.
The 1400 light years distant fog consists of dust grains, the ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, the space telescope Hubble for Nasa.
Scientists call the greater spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stars fog is the group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The cradle will produce ever more involved.
These stars cloud, together with the Rosetten fog, brings new baby stars - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this light bright galaxy with a small black hole is not, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that he was born just after the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope will have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperfeld Hey - even before it began a year later to the stars Galileo Galilei observation.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever greater, and the insights they provide, deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, in this image, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
You can gaze into space on two levels, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma Telescopio is huge - the mirror is at 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope is segmented in South Africa - in order to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of eleven metres.
As part of the design: the telescope is in his elevation angle - and thus limited in his mobility.
The hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is - despite comparatively low mirror diameter - the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers told the space for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can help by putting computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in Chile's Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - makes his name.
With its four mirrors in the telescope can also the infrared spectrum.
Also on the Chilean ESO Observatory is the planned European Extremely Large Telescope.
Its main mirror is to include 42 meters - and nearly 1000 mirrors elements.
But with images can be expected until 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each with an average of ten metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which provides them with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the summit of Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope with a mirror average of thirty metres.
It is here on an illustration.
But the main impressions from space provides the space telescope Hubble.
Since the April 24, 1990, already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope for extrasolar planets - especially for those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, was commissioned by the Nasa announced that identified 1235 planet candidates since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture are documented the final launch preparations at the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be taken until at least 2018 on board an Ariane5 spacecraft.
The primary mirror of Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists estimate that the Mercury also at the South Pole ice.
However, there are no reliable data, since the Messenger far closer to the North Pole to the planet.
Radar measurements for decades have pointed out that there are on the ice.
The Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first revolves around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.

Every drink I butter - and 168 years old are
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan reach a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country, where 97-year-old is still relatively young.
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan reach a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search in the country, where 97-year-old is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The mini-bus direct on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rushing rivers and simple Bauernhäusern.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think that you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
The Caucasian ethnic group of the Talyschen lives, which is not much known, except that it perfectly Farsi and Azeri speaks and is very durable.
"Is Lerik.
The small town of flaunts to stoke runaway architecture from Soviet times, which does not fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Hardly any tourists from Europe come here, too onerous, is the arrival of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours, because the road is.
The fabulous wealth of the country's oil in the Caspian Sea, is not here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the tourist attraction.
"Baku was in May with the Eurovision Song festival - and next year we have here is a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, the only one in the world.
Here is the similar.This documented by about eight dozen Talyschen from the area, who are older than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years of a child
But controversial star of the museum is the shepherd irali Müslümov, which will be 168 years old.
But it is not a birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümovs age but extremely doubtful.
"In 1805, he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136, he is said to have a daughter.
It right irali Müslümov at his age by a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, age, researchers at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There is also a many hochaltrige people striking how in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "live in Sardinia of very old men."
Due to the lack of documentation is to have no scientific proof of age, especially civil register.
Every day becherweise melted butter
But the fact is that the people of the region around Lerik often striking a biblisches age.
There are currently 20 people who are older than 100 years.
So why live here in the south so many Hochbetagte?
The Azeri tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh declared with the specific genes of Talyschen.
Museum director Fatulayeva believes, however, that it is a matter of the diet.
But that should be the high-calorie diet of Talyschen as healthy, meat, bread and milk products, in particular, love and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, not just from a nutritional point of view seems plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With 97 years for this, it is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasus region.
It is sitting on the floor with a butter barrel herrollt it tirelessly.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are grandparents.
Two small children jump around.
The guests in the kitchen to prepare tea, is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in, hidden under her headscarf long, dunkelblonde dispensed reveals her son proud.
I washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and retained their colour.
"I have never used," says Mirzayeva shampoo.
Monthly pension is enough life
She has always eaten only what came from their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not bought a single time in supermarket food.
Then she told of her husband, who was in the army.
It was the worst in the of the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, is driven by the nation's father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was in power, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need for the elderly.
230 Manat (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva per month as a pension, for conditions, it is possible to live well.
And perhaps has long since Mirzayevas Bacardi son right: "The old people enjoy in our culture."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason, as long as possible to stay alive

The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future Constitution of sharia as the basis is controversial.
Egyptian President not sparing with pathos.
We need to make the switch.
"And that he will succeed, is my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but above all, the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
Because all of them, has been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, fear.
Fear of theocracy in the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He has said almost entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the powers of the Constitutional Court temporarily and expanded its competences, "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians, the world is not quite clear.
The judiciary should be ousted?
Indeed, the 234 articles, the 100 -member Constituent Assembly dominated by the Islamist in a night, were pushed through 15 -hour two-volume set, worrying.
As in past constitutions, the draft, the case law based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what is called "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation, and it is feared that Islamists will use the vague wording and the attendant legal room for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a new hinzugeführter Article: in all matters concerning the Sharia influences must be considered university, the country's main Islamic institution with great power throughout the of the Sunni Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that oversees the clergy the legislation, which would de facto disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Many in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is open to interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction should be maintained.
These dishes served during Mubarak's rule to the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in military custody.
The state should also, as stated in the draft, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" to "protect and promote its morals and values."
Legally speaking, is so vague that could control state institutions with the help of this article even the content of film art and literature.
In plain English, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly stipulates equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys to offend or slander.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Just as questionable is the phrase that "insulting people" should be banned.
There is already a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a Leader?
Interpretation, like so many in the draft, which Morsi to sign before and after words "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to the referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
For weeks, the opposition against the power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to bring the Charter, before they can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter MB) of the presidential elections.
, Nobel Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei, one of the draft Constitution "on the scrapheap of history."
Via text messaging service Twitter, he accused supporters of Morsi's, a "coup against democracy."
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said the opposition Yasser said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Ali in doing so.
And several judges announced that they would not supervise the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, as a precaution, but not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer from Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafi called, and said: "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "Säubere The country!" Protested and said: "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for control of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything, would have created civil.
The clearly wanted to the risk of Morsi's supporters.
The Muslim Brotherhood, both supporters and opponents of the draft would have spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time to the people at the ballot box to decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority of the Islamists is safe.
"The word" human rights is not even "
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, as they were in prison or under Mubarak stood in court.
Because he would not share their beliefs, but because of his human rights are indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now is not the word" human rights in the new constitution, "he said in an interview with the" Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi extension to all three branches of power in the state's lawyer did resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthening civil society, the President of the, Saeda de facto suspended."
But without civil society organisations could not function in a democracy.
Saeda alone feels abandoned by the international community, which considers the ideological direction of the fight on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This could take revenge.
A protester in Tahrir warns: "You gebährt not a monster, the more You can control."

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy the highest living standards - and not just in Europe but around the world.
The secret of the success of the country have to do something with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheese varieties.
It platziere them a pile of dirty, humid sports clothing.
And leave it there for a week.
So the nasenbetäubenden smell of Rakfisk, one of the great delights of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, which just won't go away.
Rakfisk is with salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would have stinky fish - in water up to a year.
The darkness over the land, and the weather is colder in Norway, Norwegian at a festival in Fagernes, now, that this is really very eye-catching speciality.
"You eat it raw and washed it down with a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a so-called "Rakfisk General" organized the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and take on large quantities of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Harvard.
The spirit can crowd out the smell.
I eat some.
Avoiding the Rakfisk in, he is not bad - like sushi, which has quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there was no cooling opportunities and was soaked fish in the autumn in airtight salt water barrels.
In the deepest winter, he was removed after a long fermentation and - no doubt with the help of theRule subdued - consumed alcohol.
Even a generation ago had thousands of Norwegians in search of work, to leave their country and mainly in the United States.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a booming job market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, not so long ago was far richer than Norway, are immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly smelling part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive meals, which can be bought here.
But everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs $10.
Norway does not often in the world press, and most people do not seem to interfere with that.
Still, to name Anders Breivik hates it here - those racist right-wing extremists, who last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, it referred only to the "incident on 22 July."
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone is in its peace-loving country to such brutal killings.
The main responsibility for today's wealth of Norway is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien since the early 1970 s, the growth of the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with enthuse Rakfisk and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are a - as they say - sensible people.
Her English is just like that of most people here.
We are not, we may not redeem your boasting.
Norway has been very cautious with its oil wealth - a large proportion of the industry proceeds will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
As in the years leading up to the world economic crisis all money around, they had not hielt Norway.
"As long as we can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, Rakfisk," it deals with easy laughter.
I am standing in the snow and another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a moose burgers is something else. The juicy meat goes down me.
But on the evening of Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations that organise a Rakfisk dinner where guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - can vote fish smell sense of.
There is a live TV circuit with a fly at show, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?"
"Here are our points to Harvard."
We applauded laughs.
A man falls from his, perhaps overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict haze of the whole fish.

Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces difficult start
While preparing Mexico's President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto on his arrival, the BBC's Will Grant of the challenges ahead of it and the mixed feelings of its people.
The traffic is particularly bad in Mexico City.
Even in better days, this is always a congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel, several important transport routes in the capital and has sealed off the streets for chaos.
The aim was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto as president, and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of President Felipe Calderon's Mexico has to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has cost 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy, we can achieve this goal.
Before he went to the U.S. president on an equal footing, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, large part of the country, which surrounds the capital, opinions are divided on the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo remembered fondly, for example,.
Residents of the resort to write to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto built and a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads that were here.
With his name attached outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Hernandez, who as a congressman for the party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, with regard to the security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The Congressman incredible admits that the party after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos great expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The accusations from the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct guy, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, but above all, he is someone who can listen to.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüber tours and, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of vital urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight the drug gangs operating in the districts, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On an of wasteland near a large landfill sites were left behind in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murders of women.
During the term of governor Pena Nieto were murdered in the State of Mexico about 1,000 women - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which for their violence and the killing of innocent women.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is not tackled the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least adequately.
But in the worst case of his government have closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the run-down district, fighting Irinea Buendia with tears, as she shows me photographs of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if the body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia).
There were signs that she was beaten, and the bodies discipline had already used.
While her mother tells her story, from the wall a picture of Mariana on us. It is right next to a cross, which is a single word: justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, have denied it.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin troubler, Nörglerin.
They simply want to, that we accept their verdict and.
"But that is not possible when there were so many errors and omissions," she says.
If welcomes President Pena Nieto, the President body-peeling on Saturday, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been drawn in the last six years of violent crime, and the new president has promised to take care of this problem, particularly during his tenure at.
"I hope that as president he is, as he was as governor," said PRI Congressman incredible in Valle del Bravo.
But that is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.

The U.S. Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of, while serving in Iraq thousands of confidential documents.
The material published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday was fine with Manning, the forms were filled out by the officials after their meeting with Manning during his detention in a military prison, where he had spent from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced conditions of detention.
The officials, Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When asked him on Friday to the forms, Manning that he has the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the establishment as a whole was as "very professional."
The forms, so fine, had no complaints about mistreatment, although officials had questioned Manning directly on his treatment.
Manning said that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed this with him and to deal with this, but they have been recorded.
"They wrote (after meeting the concerns of" no problems ," and this did not necessarily mean that I said nothing at all," says Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he has not complained about his treatment in January 2011, when he met with a committee that he should investigate several months earlier on a form mentioned suicide.
Manning said, his intention during the that meeting have been its observer status to "prevention of injury" downgrade.
The military said that it had this restrictive status - is the one step below the suicide threat - assigned to his and the protection of others.

He had only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay on the move, because it is a day had been forbidden to sleep or lie down.
He must have always sleep with light that moved from outside in his cell.
If he had turned over at night and could not see his face more guards, have woken him so that he is barking up the wrong tree.

My Mexican American identity crisis.
Due to the lack of opportunities, many people were forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them hard times, he says
Navarre popotte believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City I had just crossed the hall and was arrived at the passport control, wide.
Signs pointed to two queues, one for "Mexican Wochos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Number" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and has been all my life, "Mexicans."
An ethnic symbol - just am friends in Boston "Irish" or "Italians" call my friends in New York.
Later, I opted for "Mexican" / ."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shortcuts or binding.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to say in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I will not go.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for registration.
I thought about that moment this week, as did the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all those issues which are expected to meet the heads of the two countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is one reason that Mexicans remain today, with a high degree of probability in Mexico, rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally itself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc after the European Union.
Mexico's Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war against the drug cartels, although he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single idea that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and forced the country's leadership under vorgehaltenem gun to leave them more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries rather than in minutes, the memories of this event.
So once, an U.S. government official mildest criticism of Mexico, one hears - in the Mexican press and among the elites, the country's - complaints about how the Americans the sovereignty of their neighbour's.
And the Monte Zuma's children on the.
And yet, in truth, is the biggest challenge in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - offered no chance in Mexico, and in the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
In Mexico.
And while we may be living the American dream, good schools and received good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is certainly the United States.
In addition, we are aware that we do not like many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and looking down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico never strong enough.
They believe our existence is a symbol of failure.
If not failed our families in Mexico, they would have.
And then we would not be caught behind the silk curtain now see - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and einwanderte legally as a child in the United States, I am reminded that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans, because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans blame them.
While it is an U.S. citizen, as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans who I know have the feeling of, neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
It enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in none of them.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And we are seen as Mexicans in the United States.
I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes it even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education and want to record their links to the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues, how great a visit to this country and put pressure on political leaders to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption and the drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I am afraid, because you alone,.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a year and a half centuries, they also have to accept that some Mexican Americans have a, for what happened to their family members so long ago.
Hmmm).
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone for peace
There can be any lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the bud.
Amid the usual recriminations countless buildings in ruins, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, were killed and six Israelis - and, for the first time rockets from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem caught in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that could find the deadly standoff finally end.
A war that neither will be won or lost
At first glance seems appropriate given the current situation is optimistic.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November, have strengthened the this week's fighting hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis, although his group even suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders killed and packed the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and densely bevölkertesten corners of the planet, Israel has failed so far to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas wins in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has to hold powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power, which was once known as well as Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken on Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that Israel is an Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah power over Syria, where rebels could be an increasingly islamistischeren character before the Stürzung Bashar Assad, to to Jordan, where Hamas is threatening allies of the king.
And, in particular the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi - by far the most densely populated and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 2011 30 years until his overthrow, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood is out with Hamas and its leaders more popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations could prove Hamas as a player that can't be squeezed out of Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, however, to draw the opposite conclusion.
Military terms, however, that Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome," has been able to prove itself and many of the Hamas rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while Israel will be able to sleep peacefully.
In diplomatic terms, the United States has been steadfast in their position. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the industry, which hineinverlaufen in the West Bank and in the main part of an eventual Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements that have been declared for international law, however, be.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud Party has allied itself in the run-up to the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren group.
Why is this cunning Palestinians cuddled and handed them their own state?
If they had, the control of the West Bank, just like their in Gaza, then it would not fire rockets?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and to punish, should they dare to raise their heads.
It may be able to the hardliners. But the Arab Spring could make them.
Even if the Islamists, who are now in power in Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will focus initially on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of his four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama, in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking tentative steps towards democratisation, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which is undoubtedly will explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, exploded as a bus in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only worsen the situation.
Bloody missions for the eradication of Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand over the years increasing its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside
The answer is that the the more reasonable members of both parties, which most of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states, which Israel is stepping down for security purposes.
The - in the near future small - hope is that the cease-fire outsiders more influence on the implementation of this solution.
Together with Turkey and Qatar, Egypt must now stop the flow of arms into the Gaza Strip and Hamas is better positioned than ever to the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of 1967 borders, with land swaps, and a shared Jerusalem, to convince.
Outsiders Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state, with the forthcoming request for U.N. observer status.
Obama must do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were also participating.
But this is a sad, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australian for single cigarette packaging laws come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packets, which are equal for all tobacco brands
The world's first laws for single cigarettes and tobacco packaging in Australia have come into force. This brand logos and colors neutral, replaced by olive green lid, which are accompanied by with drastic images that diseased body parts and cigarette smoke show, infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images from next Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are identical, are printed in small letters.
So that leads Australia the world's most stringent rules on tobacco packaging.
The Australian Federal Government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
It is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started to smoke will not start with 26, with 99% probability accordingly.
"You can see in children younger age that they understand the message that the tobacco companies trying to compete with their brand image," federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown logo with the idea of an of a princess.
Although Australia is one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will affect only slightly on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the law.
It was said that the laws would encourage the black market trade, which lead to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of best like Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for increased and silicone without for the companies to cover the unbearable packaging, British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court with its challenge to the law.
Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and look for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in the group, which is the plan.
A number of Australian laws has banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, they are not allowed to act as sports sponsors and forced most traders to interpret cigarettes in shops longer. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sides.
"Who sells tobacco and has only a small area, in order to promote its products, not the Internet," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman has noted an increase in reports to brands, the of "ordinary people" have been written.
The question must be asked: Is this just a private person who Is so enjoyed Marlboro cigarettes that they even include a video - or a marketing agency has to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia, says that the industry will concentrate instead on marketing to deal with the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic in the World trade Organisation to challenge the new rules - those countries complain about unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries pursuing greater trade in Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
The government has held talks with other countries, according to plibersek considering similar packaging laws.
Canada 2001 was the first country, made the photographic warnings.
They have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers defiantly show.
The images do not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"It is simply an and the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a packet of cigarettes on which is printed a photo with a mouth tumour.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and this is my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the packaging have hampered his shelves.
"I took a hour to classify a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have simply prohibit cigarettes altogether - then we would have said OK, that's it, we close," he adds visibly angry.

In an ever elektrisierten world, it is nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving unexpectedly I spent five hours in the airport, as our plane due to mechanical problems, and we had to wait for another plane.
I had enough time to make a few thoughts on boredom.
I am not going to.
A waiting half a day at the airport on a flight that is pretty annoying - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies shopping) are available.
But a growing number of academics and child development experts boredom as something positive.
So far as they are concerned, it is for us - and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
So that the brain is forced to get caught up in interesting thoughts, which promotes the creativity.
And since rigid nowadays most of us almost constantly on the one or other screen, the benefits of boredom.
We should welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Bore Cathedral: A Lively history" (Yale University Press, 2011) is not the case.
"Indeed, the boredom of a very long history," he says.
The house walls Pompejis adorns a Latin graffiti about boredom, going back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that in many ways been defined and discussed is boredom.
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues after a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea of a focus group of about 100 people came to the conclusion that boredom than the experience, "to be able to do a satisfactory job, but it is not define."
Boredom differs from apathy, therefore, in such a way that is not the person, but I want to be.
In the apathy, on the other hand, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a "the process, coupled with a bad temper and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can almost hear as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although they could be two things, bored people see the problem in their area or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we have just difficult to concentrate.
In their study, "the Unengaged mind: Defi Ning Bore Cathedral in terms of attention" - to: "the idle mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," which in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science "was, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on an earlier experiment, the participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group not heard these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television, said to have more boredom than the other two groups - they had problems to focus, could find no reason for it and wrote their difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task, the disruption of attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurosciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you put a monotonous work, "as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor belt, can distract music and help to not feel bored."
Indeed, he says, we now know that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, may even combat this by physical persons remain attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who must learn herumhampeln, more and more information than those who are forced to remain seated," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will ever be boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender loudspeakers, a particularly tedious film.
But some people bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980 s on a "scale of boredom vulnerability."
On the scale found statements such as "there are a lot of things that I have to do, and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
Researchers have found that boys with of such abradability more boring than girls, Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially, with regard to the need for more and greater diversity of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty abgespannter clusters.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of adolescents in school and doing the homework bored, while 23% said to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said to feel bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he does not know whether the percentages have risen or fallen in terms of boredom.
But he was sure that "youth is seen as a particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their daily routines.
So back to my original question: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, as in the extreme case, it leads people to extreme physical risks and addicted to gambling or drugs to alleviate it, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is a professor Vodanovich, who researched the subject for more than two decades.
"With the boredom of the brain to say that we should do something else," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what to do it best.
If a boring and energy to play guitar and to cook, you will be happy.
But television can provide for happiness in the short term, but these evaporate in the long term.
So who is his bored child an iPad, it can distract from the boredom, but it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske..
And he adds: "self-regulation is transferred from one situation to another."
Not only the child learns to talk, but also in other areas more self-control.
I do not believe that we should celebrate.
We should do not see it too critical.
Instead, our objective should be to feel at of permanent Aktivitäts and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds so we should be more boring. But boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are looking for a way to switch off and relax in truth only.
"In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is hard to address, if the noise."

In Colorado, there are no clear guidelines for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado for a crime to justice, which will be in this country legally soon: the possession of a few of marijuana and a pipe, with which he smoked it.
The said that he and some friends were on a September day by car in Lamar near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers found marijuana in the car, Orozco was cited for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - excusable peccadilloes that are equipped with a penalty of $100 - and has a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," he said.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer depends on hundreds of minor drug offenses, less by the law, as the location.
Hundreds of the offences that revolve around marijuana, here and in the State of Washington, already approved similar measures, dropped.
The police authorities are adults over 21 years longer for possession on a small scale. This is allowed by law, once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts Colorados have announced that existing marijuana offenses, and people are still quoting in court.
At the same time voting in several cities, from the suburbs Denvers to the Western Mountains on new to prevent state licensed marijuana shops in the opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so rapidly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. resigned, police chief in Aurora, located east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington State loss scratch on the head.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, the conventional wisdom is that in any case, most states Colorado, with regard to the regulation of marijuana was only legalized the drug for medical purposes and then for private consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state lends itself so well to," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is also that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent that we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, known as I- 502, enters into force on 6 December and at the end of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not exist yet, but it is legalized the possession.
And unpleasant practice questions need to be addressed in this time around, as the government's target of a "fair access" to lizenziertem marijuana beeps with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds should be agreed and childcare facilities.
"It will be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal cannabis," a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, sent his staff in Aurora Chief resigned in an e-mail in which he said that the prosecutor would not pursue minor marijuana offenses in people over 21 years, and that the police "will not seek prosecutions for such offences.
The police chief resigned added that will continue to enforce the rules regulating growers of medical marijuana and urban targets would continue to pursue drug traffickers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado County prosecutor Ken Buck represents a harsher view.
After the vote, he admitted that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdrawal.
To date, 119 people have been charged for possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana in court, although many have been charged for other offenses.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute offences, to the point of the," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are themselves in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, does not adults for the possession of small quantities for longer.
District prosecutor Pete Hautz Reißinger supported this decision, but decided not to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
"I do not think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it is changing," he says.
Although 55% of voters supported the measure in Colorado, was clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
Among local officials, and the contradictory reactions throughout the state encouraged a profound dilemma in terms of the big green experiment.
In county prosecutors if it were a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver, for marijuana offenses the in court, and local acts as a spokesman for the National Organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their lives in order to prosecute people for it, that they cannot accept the legalization still," he believes.
As the first states to deal with the small quantities of marijuana like alcohol, traded Colorado and Washington as a national model for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials an era of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level as a criminal offence.
For the legalization movement hope that will give the Ministry of Justice.
Despite several striking arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states large part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor to the Obama administration believes that no doors are likely to law enforcement officials to seize smaller quantities of drugs, but probably will resist, under the new legislation to allow legal, state-regulated marijuana shops.
Several cities in Colorado not wait to see the federal authorities.
Even before the election day, some local administrations moratoriums on new marijuana shops, although it could open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month ban, which probably will be adopted next week.
"We would not be to get someone in a position where we license and then at the federal level are facing a major problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against the legislation.
We have done this for what it has not the government and then, for what was decided by the state.
There are still many questions unanswered.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford, because I am Tory
Not only university students of today are being attacked for her views
It was always my biggest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited the university that I once thought to the largest knowledge stamp in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that, the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance - did.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College at the end of the eighties -, I had intended to study history - I had packed my suitcase and brought about the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard said that I would have gone, because I had a problem that had students in neighboring rooms.
The author of A N Wilson said, I would have left the university, because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
We were harassed me for one reason only - a that seemed in this supposed birthplace of enlightenment to so narrow and cruel: My late father now Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, recent reports indicate is a new generation of students of the moderate rights under similar prosecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now taken on such proportions that a group of them last week called for the same protection, equality of gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said that they are often isolated because of their political views "active, attacked personally and declared undesirable."
They are calling for a place in the equality Nominierungskomitee their college to ensure that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary on political students screened on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," the Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It has been shown, among other things, a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student association at the University of Oxford, who drove an and silver suit and silberbesetztem Go flaunted Tock.
Conservative students at other universities say they are as "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees."
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative student at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing tendency to link universities.
People say we are like the cyber-bulling Don club, without us ever get to have. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, and history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate "uncomfortable." The 19-year-old Stephanie, Ill, says the President of the conservative student association of Oxford, they have seen members of a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I was such a minority.
As I was unbelievably timid 18-year-old in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year the university voted for Margaret Thatcher, a former student - to give due to cuts in higher education has no official title.
The atmosphere could have been even Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, get to know the new students and tutors, I received a foretaste of the future events.
I made the experience that the the mockery of Tory students only tolerated, but even with joy.
Political issues such as the miners "strike, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century translated into English. On what should have been, I was not taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a face like a pie dough, and quite unpleasant.
"Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are you just stupid?" He asked me.
The kicherten other students.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take in your spare time a few French hours - that is, if you are not too busy with your social activities," growled am Pitt.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
That evening I was in college at the dinner alone, I tippte someone typed me slightly on the back.
It was an English student from the second year named James, who presented himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is, as it is.
Anyone who is suspected of being Tory, harassed her.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be for you.
Most Tory first-year purport to be supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I later tried to distract me.
I insisted that I was not entirely agree with Mrs Thatcher.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A first-year professional philosophy, politics and economy, which, ironically, had visited as a conservative force Eton College, said to me: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"As the Tories sex?," asked me one.
The to beat each other, or?
I felt I had to have felt the same way as homosexuals from the more liberal legislation in the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
I would like to meet with like-minded after nightfall?
I should the Labour Party and to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me, I extended my intellectual eye to a purgatory of condemnation and isolation.
The only tutor, who announced himself as a Tory, was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history, which had its headquarters in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in matters of foreign policy advice and had written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place it was parochial and small-minded and rejected him for his Marxist deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy," he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with open-minded friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in all political views were accepted.
"But it is the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
They never would do something, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my Communist friends, always impeccable manners.
That tarnished his moist eyes.
Give it a chance.
I am sure that we neckt you.
It would break my heart if you were walking.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London was my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory supporters, had succumbed to pressure and put his convictions.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, which claimed another history tutor, I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I zerging secretly in shame, I saw that my parents had a "brainwashing," and called them "old idiots."
The relief lasted only briefly.
It was my father, who was the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was closed.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes gave my Reaver.
As they went, I grabbed a bag and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz).
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer in a school with such intimidation and spite.
And it is tragic that it was an university of Oxford -, which did not only 14 Tory, but until now hidden behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino elegance of the celebrity '
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture," which opened this week in London, with more Sobytii ABC Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has the designer at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a grandiose retrospektive, for the more than 130 haute Couture clothes of his "Maison" have been created in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist "il signore" is Garavani, but not without its clients could have been written.
Valentino always felt fascination for the stifling and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of the exhibition, which until 3 March, will be that there is a number of private letters and photos with the signature of the choicest aristocracy, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social ascent from humble fashion in the city of Voghera factory in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet.
In the Jószáshely love, must not be at a disadvantage.
"At least they do not enter their sites on your beautiful carpet, as do some beautiful celebrities from the music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60 s and 70 s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant.
"We all were when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," says the former wife of "being" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, we went for a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome at the home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music and its influence felt.
"All guests felt important and loved," recalls the "Top Model," which began her career in the haute Couture week in Paris in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion, because its design works of art," she says.
Fashion show of origin
The lives of Garavani is not a story of Versessenheit, by mutual love affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 metres long catwalk, which proposes a role reversal: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the catwalk, a magnificent "audience," the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress, Jackie Kennedy chose for their wedding with science evolution Onassis, the costumes, the Monica Vitti in "La Notte," or a coat wool and leather, which belonged to to the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls names like the Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion maker, 2006
Many say that, the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a jacket type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift from him," says more Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it all the other because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colours, which he uses; they have plenty of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and opinion leader in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d Arenberg can remember the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I dreamed of the age and to have the opportunity to wear one of his evening clothes...
At the end of the 90 s, it was.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party in my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a, which draped bodice with a that is worthy of the name.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," said the Italian Aristokratin between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D "Arenberg preserved their evening dresses of the fashion maker" with the utmost care ,"" because it is not a dress just a dress, but also the memories associated with them. "
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze called" (such as the fashion maker his seamstresses) were necessary to make this Ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metres long tail.
According to the journalist, his signature style even when the supreme authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the haute couture at the end of the 20 st century, "the return to the top of society."
For years, with the "savoir être" marred the elite, Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy), the highest award cavaliere del Lavoro, de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, kumuliert Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I will always be refinement, his calm, and perfect appearance be noticed," D "Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time to leave no trace of him."
And that says a princess...

The most difficult job in the world: the human working animals from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they 70 kilos of sulfur on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who earn their living by recruiting them sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day he has to get down on the floor of the crater, where solidified itself out of the earth, sulphurous gas in contact with the air.
He has extracted large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilograms, he transported them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in the turtle pace, with the balance and must put their steps carefully so that they do not slip and fall.
You know that each step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which reduce them.
Once at the top, they pave the path between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tedious heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales, a mining company has set up a little further down at a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candiolo Ngrimbi that since 1960 the deposits in the volcano and (never better) exploiting its workers, which they said 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) is charged for every kilogram of sulphur.
They then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life and for the production of wood, fireworks, cosmetics, used dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar.
"Because we usually have 70 kg, for each way we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)," said us Anto, which normally makes three trips a day.
He needed three hours for each track that he is fatigued, he has at the end of the day, but then 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The days of the mine workers" wages here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) will be paid on the day and the average monthly income of two million rupees (167 euros), is very high, "said the winner, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family after Banyuwangi, a village near returned, and for a reason, which is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I have married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty breathing, coughs and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto puts his life at the Kawah Ijen for three years, which has already left the first traces of him, even though he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty breathing, coughs and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for achieving his dream.
"I will work here two years because I open a shop or want to learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than decent English.
This pleasant and intelligent young man, but life overregulated could work as tourist guides, waiters or on at the of a hotel, but instead he carried out the work of a stretcher.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other sources and, at two o'clock every morning, because you feel the sulphur at night, where his distinctive yellow colour in the darkness of.
The shadow challenging, he is in the light of a small forehead lamp on his helmet, which he bought his own money into the crater.
About 400 bearers load on the crater floor baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the mining company mechanised the sulphur reduction in order to save costs, and provides the tools that work on their own account and are paid according to weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) fee per camera, the guardians of this natural parks, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) require the tourists who come to the shooting of the volcano and the human Tragesel.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people" protested Madrusin, a sturdy, 42-year-old economist who works three decades since leaving school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assured that he continues, "as long as it is," because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged between 10 and 18.
I will do not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur throat burns and when the wind suddenly and einklemmt mine workers in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains about serious diseases..., of course, the usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in in addition to the knees and bubbles on the shoulders, which have distorted by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back with his 53 years Drennik Unai is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, which are carried by three trucks on a goat path between the to camp in Taman Austurdalur in 18 kilometres away.
"I will do not retire, I will die here, because the volcano was my life," said that he opens his mouth wide, in which some teeth are missing.
The of his five children is with his 30 years as sulphur.
As time passes, but the poverty Lörke generation to generation in one of the hardest job in the world: the people who work as human load donkey on Kawah Ijen.

Singapore babies to save the economy
The blame for the fact that they have no children, on the career, the stress and the cost of housing and child.
"The people of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: we are fulfilling our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for a mint candies, but nevertheless, or precisely because - they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a rapper songs, the local slogans such as "is pushing a" bao " (loaf) in the oven to worry about the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, who shot the video, preserves the hope that the advert on the way to raise awareness of the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton said that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to their "national duty."
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
In Fort plant, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that there is an issue that we had to take care of.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume or with under the organization of Speed Dating evenings (rapid flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily succeed.
So we thought: Why not make something as creative as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
Those who do not take this issue lightly, the Government of Singapore.
Every year, they are $1,300 for political action to encourage citizens to have more children.
A package of government for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a wealthy, hi-tech city-state in South East Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
In accordance with its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time, when the rate was about 2 - which is also known as replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why not get the more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national civil authority, says that it is in a "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to marry and to have to form a family much more options in terms of life goals and priorities," she says.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of people living alone and the delay of the marriage and birth, is the result of the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for low wages and not integrate.
The rise in immigration is seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year reached its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there was an attempt to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on economic growth in a nation that tax revenues, the cost of health care and immigration policy, shows the example of Singapore also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve, not so many small apartments.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has started to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes" and cannot be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a residential area of 46 square metres and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can support the lifestyle of living alone, and that they discourage the construction companies to build large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company El Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" to sell much more quickly than larger apartments.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out for days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
It is, however, that the new standards give the developers clearer guidelines, which were previously put obstacles in the way if they wanted to build too many small residential units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, is the talks with the Singapore, working in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are stressed, the housing and education are expensive, so it will be delayed by many," says a young manager.
The children can get other.
"It is important for me, on my own money and time," says another, about twenty years old man.
Men and women run their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as reasons that they cannot have children.
, for the last word when it comes to have children - because the government can do so much.

What is private for anyone under the age of 16?
As this definition applied to their daily lives and the social networks?
He understands the risks to which he exposes himself, if he makes the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15, which are often in the network.
In four of the cases linked to the term "something very private" on a personal level and "on the password and user," if you apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets, I would not be known in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge attempt the meaning of "private" in sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has spent two years on accounts.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother should know them, but not the whole world," he confirmed.
On FB I invite beautiful images or images of games.
I think my time with friends.
"I would not share a photo, not by me, or someone who makes the stupid" he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked, crime, or abusive or violent to write comments.
Jorge reassured to know that he in FB has 35 friends, and nine Folger in Twitter.
Most of them have relatives.
Including the mother, who has the password to one of the accounts.
I reported on Twitter to express myself and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if someone says to me, I would just invite them high," he added.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can speak with relatives in the distance or with friends," he said.
He replied that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger asked.
Even if someone empfähle strangers to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits to not know 20 of the people, he has added his friends list.
"I am not shocked, because we have something in common, such as music," he admits.
According to the boys has made him no suggestions or asked him to his address or telephone number.
"If somebody harassed me or that I asked him, I remove it from my account," he admits.
José appeared to Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation.
The boys are not experiences unknown, known today as cyber bullying.
The friend of a friend was held to ransom in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José the victim has not closed the account.
"He has made it only in private."
Then he set up a number of steps to an user account.
In contrast to this boy Jorge would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do if he is very nice to me or I would like to one.
"But I know that this is cyber bullying," he says.
Key issues
Marie Los Porras, a teacher of English with university degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was created as a vehicle for the search for information, with the release of these pages have changed the rules of the game but," she says.
Porras explained that the academics Marc Prensky, holder of a master's degree in education at Yale University and the author of "digital natives and Immigrants," these words to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that they should teach, where we learn even more," he says.
He says that it is a complex issue, "because we demand that they have a defined criteria about what should be published or said, in an age where the maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be picky when it is most important to them, to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach children and young people, which is what privacy, to ask them questions that brings them food for thought.
"To tell you not to do it, does not work," he says.
Porras then lists several options: There are things that you don't tell a stranger. Why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, if you like if you published a photo of you, as it was released from a friend?
You know what you publish the other?
Have you asked for the others advance permission, if you have labelled pictures of celebrations?
And another question: Is all know what you're doing in each moment?
A further point is to give them that they must act online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside of the Internet is with respect, decency and other principles, and the same should apply to the social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the guidelines of the social networks.
If they understand all of it, they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the importance of the Eröffnens one user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what should share or publish it," he says.

"South America must learn to the integration of the citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that a goal is the creation of a common citizenship, and "South America can learn something from Europe."
Correa, who is the 6th summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru, that the Europeans "killed in the Second World War and other conflicts" and "are now virtually a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, the members countries of the Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community; but there is still a reactionary sectors who want a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reform of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the target to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account those who have signed the San José Agreement on human rights.
Those who teach, never commit to something, and in exchange we sign the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said in to the political asylum, Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, was granted.
Correa assured that he does not regret that decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that it "was at the time, that Assange extradited to a third country and would not be complied with procedures."
He also criticised the Swedish justice system, which requires him to an interrogation because of an alleged sexual offence, while the Swedish law "allowed through a video conference on its territory the Embassy of Ecuador in London could have been carried out."
Correa said that there was a risk that would affect the health and mental state of Assange.
"He is in our message that I have not spoken with him, the ambassador informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious," said the Head of Ecuador.
There is a danger, though, that he would be physical and psychological damage, because he was caught in a tight space and could not carry out physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of all people," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum, Assange was granted since the month of June in the Ecuador Embassy in London, is the granting of a free letter, so he could travel to Ecuador, and that it is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe's lies. He stressed that there had been talks with London to find a solution to the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, that we do not apply in this case, however, there were ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Sanguineti Tsar Garzón, a series of procedures at various European forums," he said.
And "when Britain granted morning this, in my opinion, this is done."
And if Mr Assange to Sweden interrogated on the Embassy of Ecuador in London or via Skype, as allowed under Swedish law and in other cases, be resolved the problem.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that infringe the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverted politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador more dominated by such journalists "and not by bankers or hegemonic and spießbürgerlichen countries," and I think he took a re-election "will deepen the revolution to continue the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to uphold the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "must stand firm and no opportunism and no grieving as a legal coup d," because it "was destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador is also the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the verdict of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which places the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua to negotiate with the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries, is "absolutely right."
Currently, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between the South and Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be fully addressed, so that they can overcome and look forward.
Similarly, he said to a successful conclusion of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court that "it is right to go to international bodies for Latin America, if both countries commit themselves to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he presents himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to reach his third consecutive mandate, he admitted that he "sees this opportunity with optimism and joy, even though it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he would lose the elections in February 2013 that he would retire from political life.
Has never interested me personally, but in doing so unjust circumstances such as these socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement, I had the belief that it was, which guaranteed the likely victory, so I must assume this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, I retreat from public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"It is decided," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just finished with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he had been planned for a routine treatment there, and that would be expected that he could travel to Cuba again after the election campaign.
"It in no way means a return to the state of health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian leader today in Lima on the 6th Summit of the Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with the call for greater regional integration, in order for sustainable progress, equality and security.

The cause of a death due to AIDS is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the outcome of the inquiry: HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor without visible success "tried to weaken."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to devote himself to his disease and started to inform themselves about, and this with such commitment, that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 22 years, at the beginning of the 90 s was hard to see as many doubts, there were few treatment options and more Stigmata.
At that time, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS, to say goodbye, "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the clinic, who know none of their disease and the virus already has caused damage and has exhausted her immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, the first reported cases, "the great success today that the survival of a patient who undergoes treatment in time, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG diet, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information had been based in April this year from a respected scientific publication.
The an expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists have that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that was the years of survival and quality of life by the degree of impairment of the immune system of people at the start of treatment, and that would give greater opportunities that are not addicts: up to 30 years in a census of 200 CD4 and 50 years for on a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above that, at the age of 25 years who gets diagnosed HIV positive, in that sense "can easily be 75 years old, as long as he is under control," he said the expert.
In order to evaluate this progress right must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today, an average of 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS, from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) affecs), it is nevertheless true that have died since the advent of AIDS in 60 percent of patients covered in the national database.
In Jalisco in the year 2011 255 people died, and until the month of May this year, 187 deaths; however, to be reassured that there are is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are still dying people?
- In my opinion, is not the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no problems with the supply of drugs. The problem is that the people in far advanced state, because they do not know their infectious condition, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if you already have an infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality, earlier diagnosis is necessary, and all the people, where necessary, must be offered screening tests on a massive scale."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo de plans del Sida en Jalisco (Coe Ida) (state committee for AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and the patient as Fabrizio, who his test at a private laboratory had called, and it was only because a friend had made by him, despite his young age already in the AIDS era was, and even the Kaposi's Sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and we do not want to hear.
"If I have to die, then burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to the improvement, I ernähre me well, I take the medication.
Today his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I am, do a lot, have an active sex lives, but responsible, I respect to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who have today with his testimony in the context of the global AIDS Day fear.
They should make the test if they belong to the risk group. The sooner they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between health programmes and the ordinary citizens there are major holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the specific places "was actually increased the distribution of condoms; previously they were made separately, now they give us packages with one hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to an a condom," he said.
The risk for new infections among young people.
"Why do you need?" Is a widespread derision question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and health system, which does not want to expose young people, the correspondent said.
He proposed to move this inefficient distribution; the condoms are not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities that are frequented by young people.
It should not be promoted promiscuity.
It should not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio Gonzalez replied to the question of whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not; it is best to bring the closer to those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 total (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV).
The state is seen nationally in 4th place new and cumulative AIDS cases, and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of cases of infection through sexual intercourse, 6% of the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because there are non-subcribers case for every 4 or 5 people who do not know.

While the judge refers the matter to ensure that the bankruptcy law of the United States, says the creditors must be subject to the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit based in New Orleans, first of all, that the main proceedings for the trade is dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not in procedures in the event of the insolvency of companies with trans-national profile.
In fact, was created to this end, the model law of the United Nations for the unification of international trade law, with the American law Institute as a peacemaker.
Secondly, the judgment that without the votes of the societies after recognizing the liabilities of the estate, who had the branches of in-vitro with its parent company, would not have achieved the required majority for in of the restructuring of the debt.

The vote was 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are to blame for its difficult position from 2008 as part of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country.
For this reason, the Gonzalez Sada family before the same court of appeal against an order for the vote in plenary, in that, all the judges, because only three of them were.
It is that, the Cerciorare protest calling for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
This is most serious in this case that the court a document, the Mexican government under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court) has been sent, which in vitro procedure within the framework of the law on trading bankruptcies, and what is pointed out that it had kept strictly to the agreement signed by by both countries in order to respond to the Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
It also noted that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e., the established rules for the cross-border insolvency cases of guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.

Then recommended to the free throw Raymond Gausse specialists and was one of our best shooter.
I remember, as he said that if possible Mincy had a championship for Bayamon, would make Gausse for another.
The championship of the vaqueros with Gausse was granted him, but even from a distance, because he was already 1988 at the top of the class.
At the time, he its application and to enjoy the Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in vorolympischen tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we were the fourth place, what should have been bronze, if this Canadian referee, we would not have been the last move was repeated for the second time, said Reyes.
This group was the 1990 World Cup the best national team, you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those who won in the 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite is the team of the Pan-American Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and the U.S. gave the team a fight, as when they won they were against us in the World Cup bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but we won a gold medal and gave us great pleasure of the vorolympischen tournament was 1995 in the La Plata, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, against all odds we won the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking account of his career in the different leagues, in which he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coach like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Arman Dito Torres.
Of the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best that you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era for the national team from 1988 to 1995, the BSN at the beginning of the 90 years he up to 17 teams in a season.
What can you do?
There are things that I would have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their area and meet in the national playoffs teams from other corners of the island.
Today, many children unnecessary trips and games.
At least I can see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I would like to listen to music, watch videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who was always by my side.

The start of the course, the "end of the world"
The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when religious professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: the end of the "long" of the Mayan calendar's reverse counting on December 21, many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what it should be expected in the next two months: the destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have described as "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists believe that begins the Apocalypse.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester ever," said this week the students at Rutgers University Camden, New Jersey.
If someone analyse what happened today in the world, as if we were just thirty days, this would be a really good period.
And he pointed out that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who this semester, which should be the last in history courses on the "end of the world."
In Temple, the beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker the "media, culture and the end of the world."
The students examine every week apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way in which offered hypothetical scenarios that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic terms content and studied how they compare compared with real life.
"I tried to inform students about what is possible, probably, is credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, a professor of Latin American history and his colleague Matthew rest Amara Solari, formed a professor of art history and anthropology beisitzende a team, a course with the simple title "the End of the World."
"We are not 2012, so that we retain the option to be able to the, in the event that the world does not," said rest.
Despite the "impending doom" must study the students create projects and participate in final exams.
In Penn State's final examination will be carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, why the students have no other choice to "continue working until the night, where the world is supposed to end," said rest.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no seats," said rest space on its course for students with a high average, which was filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the beginning of the semester we received e-mails from students who asked whether still seats.
For its part, the students say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Brid Gid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Camden for religion and sociology from, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sects or religious mentality is really only a matter of comfort or its absence.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and health care, all seen apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of a classroom, where it will be informed," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed - and less a professor - said that the final date of 21 December to believe.
"Our first project the prophecy of the Maya, and in some way discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said rest.
But he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society, which dates back several centuries, as people reacted to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased the speculation.
"Other local people do not think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who taught this year in the Philippines, he quickly replied to the question of whether there would be a course on the "end of the world."
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint on an exception to a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Rest all pointed out that there has been talk over the years many days last court, and said that if on 21 December, nothing happens, "people immediately think about a new date" philosophierten or that of the 21th of December is the beginning of a seven-year period, which would be the end of the world.
Students and professors are easy to this date.
Several said that they have to go to celebrate "the end of the world."
"Maybe I call a few friends, so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
