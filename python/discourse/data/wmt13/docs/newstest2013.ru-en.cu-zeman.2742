The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election
Republican leaders defended their policies to combat spin on the election.
But in the center of Бреннана believe the myth, arguing that the cases of spin on the elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from a lightning strike.
The same lawyers Republicans have counted only 300 cases of electoral spin in the United States for ten years.
One thing can be said with certainty: these new trends will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly to discredit the system of american democracy.
Unlike Canada american states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009, make laws, усложняющие registration process or voting.
This phenomenon has gotten a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, only for one year 2011 was taken by 180 legislation limiting the right to vote in the state's 41.
The new election laws require pressing voter ID and proof of having фотографией with american citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reducing the period of the early vote, voter registration упраздняют right in the voices of the day and undercut the right to vote for eligible citizens судимость.
Before the 2006 elections no US state not обязывал voters make ID with фотографией.
Indiana-became the first staff, who gave such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court ruled in 2008 конституционность law, enacted in индиане.
Republican officials scurried to extend this practice and in other states.
Over the past two years, they have spurred bills, commit the voters make identity documents with фотографией, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, in contrast to the Quebec american citizens do not have such a universal identity documents, as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of american citizens, there are 21 million people, entered for the voting age, have no identity documents with фотографией, выданного government body of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 will not have such a document.
While the cost of obtaining required identity documents, often more than a hundred dollars.
New restrictions диспропорционально affect young people, minorities and people with low income levels.
In fact, 25% of african-Americans, 15% of people who earn less than $35,000, 18% of people over the age of 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years, did not have the required identity documents with фотографией.
But that is not all.
The students-voters, who, as a vote for candidates from the Democrats, several states are not permitted to use the ID with фотографией, выданное their учебным заведением.
But these same states allow members and рыболовецких охотничьих clubs who vote for Republicans, mainly used for the voting удостоверения, given to these клубами.
Until 2004, no state has not demanded proof of the presence of american citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2001, more than a dozen states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures are aimed at, obviously, to restrict voting by those who come from Latin America.
Is that two-thirds of latino voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws упраздняющие registration of voters in day of voting in eight states.
They also have the right to individuals or groups to help those who wish to зарегистрироваться.
This restriction is not without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped make in lists of some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, have led to a drop in the level of 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared to 2006 year.
In addition to republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters, who voted first, were афроамериканцами, although recent accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with the domain of Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted first.
In contrast to the white, which, while creating 76% of voters who voted, among the first was only 46%.
Of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws limiting voter registration.
A few projects laws was ветировано state governors — Democrats.
The action most неоднозначных laws was suspended with the intervention of the general prosecutor of the United States.
This enabled in part to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring formally identity documents with фотографией.
However, the new rules, joined in the action, of course, will make it hard to generate suffrage in the election of 2012.
Critics of the Democrats' rail bias laws that have been taken, seeing in them an obvious target for it to influence the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The report from the center Бреннана 2011 reveals that the States, these laws are implemented, 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system, will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential election of 2012.
Only one thing clearly: these new regulations will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly to discredit the system of american democracy.

Скрининг cancer предстательной cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the test on пса gives sometimes perverse results, лженегативные, and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to бесполезному medical intervention.
The men, and so reluctant проходящим диспансеризацию, there is what the засомневаться even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the research, conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among groups исследуемых, so it is difficult to interpret the findings, and it is difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the european, found different levels of mortality in those patients who underwent скрининг, and those who do not pass.
This study also showed, after a 12-year-old observation that the probability of метастаз at 30-40% higher for those who have not passed скрининг.
So, I recommended to be tested since, with 40 or 50 years, if one of the direct relatives had cancer простаты.
Men of african-american descent is also subject to an increased risk.
The key is making the right decisions, as the only cancer detected.
The cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим.
The patient needs to clarify the extent of the risk of his ракового disease, offering him the possible options, without necessarily простаты cancer treatment, which poses no risk to life in the long term and making choices, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many of the men who have surfaced, the cancer will not undergo a course of treatment, because their cancer is not aggressively and poses no threat to life.
We let them offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress – we start treatment.
Increasingly we exactly define criteria for making decisions about who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
Thus, I recommended to still be tested.
But it is also important проконсультироваться with their doctor to determine, or there is no need to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of урологии Мовембер, has created a tool that enables us to assess all for and against the passage of test пса.

To prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe, to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, the observance of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
That is, if all people nice питались and quite moving, 30% of cases рако could have been prevented.
“If no one was smoking, this figure has risen to at least 50 %,” highlights André Болье, press secretary of the canadian association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by наследственностью.
Several types of cancer remain the entirely.
For canadian Association cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is doing huge damage to the health of people.
“Even today in квебеке there are 1.5 million smokers,” says press secretary André Болье.
Asia fact: in 10 years, after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is declining in half.
Weight
According to the кар, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, Tolstoy and direct кишки, пищевода поджелудочной, cancer and матки.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against cancer кишки Tolstoy,” adds in the association.
Nutrition
Association also recommends to limit consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it raises the risk of cancer sufferers from Tolstoy.
It should also avoid колбасных products.
Консервация meat by копчения, сушки or засола, can lead to education канцерогенных substances.
“The past can harm the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer,” поясняют in Association.
Витамины
In recent years, many scientists have been exploring the influence of vitamin supplements to the development of cancer.
But for the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called однозначными.
According to the SCC, vitamin E studies give conflicting results.
If one of them showed the reduction in the risk of developing cancer простаты, another gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of the impact on the development of cancer, vitamin D and there is no complete clarity.
But Mr Больё stresses that their anxiety and Family history is important to discuss with the doctor.
“Сдача analysis not leads to cancer.”

Бозон Хиггса in detail
Минувшим summer reported that scientists may have found бозон Хиггса, caused the fuss – and not without reason.
Is that this бозон explains all the mass of particles in the universe, nothing.
Moreover, this latest particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model, our best, or, in any case, “the least imperfect” descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, but which has not managed to find empirically.
But physics is still not certain that it is precisely about бозоне Хиггса.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we have to deal with, really new частицей and that it strongly resembles бозон Хиггса predicted by the standard model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, is to confirm, though for the full confidence of some of the data is not yet достает.
Imagine all the same, that it is about бозоне Хиггса, as the chances of astray seem minimal, and consider what it means.
There is, in this world, one law is inevitable, гласящий, two things that may not be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around that rule, does not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself.
But although the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of this nature: the principle of the Pauli exclusion, which постулирует that two particles cannot occupy the same space at one and the same time, if they are in the same “квантовом state” is a “state” is, in broad outline, in some of their characteristics.
Because of this, the share of physics particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find a decent citizens, called фермионами, who wisely obey the Pauli.
In the other, the суетятся бозоны гнусная Banda, the anarchists, who have no respect for nothing — at least to this principle, which means that they can преспокойно prove to be in the same place at the same time.
Both reports site (incidentally, totally необыкновенный) Particle Adventure Berkeley lab, these бозоны was, in turn, on two groups: мезоны, about which we are not here to speak, and “force” particles, which are subject to the forces of nature and that in some way applies бозон Хиггса.
These same бозоны, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.
In fact, if you have been able to read the хронику, this one thanks to the incredibly banal бозону: фотону, or “частице light”, which is “курьером электромагнитной forces.”
In fact, when one particle, with electrical заряд, accelerating or changing direction, this “violates” электромагнитное field in this particular place, roughly as the stone for the fishpond.
From this “violations” is born электромагнитная wave (of light, or инфракрасного radiation or ультрафиолета, etc.), and this surge is no more than a фотоном - and, therefore, one of the “host бозонов forces.”
A more stable field
The same thing is happening with бозоном Хиггса, with only the gaps that to this бозон emerged, must be “broken” another field, field Хиггса.
But the field Хиггса much, much стабильнее электромагнитного field; to stir up his need to achieve and very, very high энергий, as if it came to замерзшем пруде, the surface which could offend only very large stone.
This is why a huge ускоритель particles, as one who are exploiting the ЦЕРНе - G Адронный Коллайдер, a ring with диаметром in 27 kilometers! - to achieve such huge энергий.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field, useful, and also to explain the relationship between бозоном Хиггса and host.
In fact, not all particles, and not all materials interact with electromagnetic fields.
Some, like for example магниты, interact, while others-no: leaf paper, for example, will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the field Хиггса: those who interact with supply, while others (like фотон, incidentally) it does not have.
So, what is the “can do” all of these studies, asked Miss Пламондон?
In science, they are used to test the right standard model (see), and it also allows physicists нащупать divergence between the results of observations and expectations of projectiles.
In addition, some of them object to yearn for such divergence of comprehension, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for “new physics” and silence some holes model.
The latter, we need to say, still has significant shortcomings, not offering no explanation for the gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which shapes the roughly 80% of the universe (oops-oops!).
But as far as ЦЕРНе such disparities are not found.
Consequences
The benefits from these studies for the daily life of the average person's difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 1960's pioneers research laboratories in лазера белла could not even think, and what kind of revolution will bring to their work.
They foresaw their application in science, but not much more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who has worked in Лабораториях белла, where, in 1960, was invented лазер, and who himself has developed the first continuous лазер (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that initially лазер was seen more as a “лабораторный гаджет.”
Imagine …
And, moreover, can an annex is for the toolkit, сопровождающего study.
For example, the same Уиллиард Boyle during their optic research in 1969, has developed a small датчик light.
This датчик, although this was not at all of its original definition, now serves as the “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of great Адронного Коллайдера will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.

Паллиативная aid is the best way to die … &pipe; “debt”
The Commission for a decent death in квебеке recently discussed a delicate question of end-of-life.
The debate should resume shortly, and in this time is preparing a bill.
Yet in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
“Debt” tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in Монтережи.
Cancer простаты, разрушавший his uniqueness, gave him a reprieve for two years.
“I was given five years, I had lived seven,” he says, between life and death, лежа in bed in the orphanage паллиативного nursing Victor - Гадбуа in Белёй, which arrived on the eve of.
“But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare,” he says.
The disease is doing their job: unbelievable weakness, which does not give themselves walk in the toilet and even their own feed.
Sitting at the table, on which it is worth аппетитный lunch, he agrees, and seem to have helped him to eat.
He бодрится, even manages to smile, to talk with незнакомыми people who work around him, bring him drugs, are in his ванну.
Courage in normal death.
“I have the greatest desire to me вылечили from diarrhea, it is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff has found the drug from this malaise.
“During his life teaches us that a man should мочиться standing,” Pierre tells Broder, a psychologist in the orphanage-Viktor Гадбуа.
Регрессировать to state child-for some unbearable humiliation.
“Everything depends on the ability to cope with the decline of the man”, he argues.
So how, in the view of many people, although паллиативным departure, in the most important events случаяются and the height of this decline.
Patients coming in паллиативный asylum-Viktor Гадбуа, all sick cancer.
Forecasts look to for them at the three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called “therapy”.
Miss A., 89 years, most fears die “in the consciousness that is being strangled.”
But instead, the disease has allowed me to know their children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don't want nothing more in life,” she says, before being allowed to put it, маску облегчающую breath.
It still awaits in the coming days, the recent visit of his son, приехавшего from Italy.
In the orphanage, Viktor Гадбуа - with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is паллиативный departure, which remains, when nothing more can be done.
To make the death of more comfortable.
In квебеке for every 11 700 residents account for one seat in institutions паллиативной aid.
This very little, given that, sooner or later, we are all dead.
Here, life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian мартель - one of the doctor's home.
Whether some comfort physical, emotional or душевный.
Умирающему we agree to provide ротовые полоскания from бренди or пепси, despite what he asks.
Диабетиков we no longer заставляем control levels of sugar.
And death is part of the order.
Yesterday evening, we brought beer Mr H., who died today at night.
On the morning of his son допил this beer at the feet of the late.
“We help close, as well as patients,” tells натали Савар, director of caring for the sick.
In the orphanage, Viktor Гадбуа - no one day is not identical to the previous one.
Alongside the 93-year old man, who revels in his last meeting with family in the yard, расположившись on their подушках during тоста in his honor, tragically die young man 36 years, окруженный parents, his wife and two small children and перепробоваший all to survive.
“In the past six months, from three to five коек, always busy cancerous sick in the age of 45 years,” says Dr. Christian озабоченно мартель.
53% of patients, to be taken in the orphanage-Viktor Гадбуа, arriving from home, and 47% of hospitals.
The problem of access to паллиативному caring
Is that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to паллиативному caring, that is, to the withdrawal, which is given to alleviate the suffering of patients, Secretaries in the stage of their life, whether in the home, in the hospital or in the orphanage.
And some institutions, such as asylum-Viktor Гадбуа and society паллиативного nursing home large Монреаля, are pursuing more or less exclusively on care for cancerous sick.
It is a big gap in the health care system of Quebec leads many doctors specialists паллиативному caring for fear of the law, легализирующего assistance and aid in suicide.
Since October циркулирует manifesto signed by beacons in паллиативного withdrawal, Dr Балфуром Маунтом and Dr Бернаром Ляпуантом and свидетельствующий about their disagreement with this initiative.
According to Dr. Christian мартель, Quebec's health-care system is not enough, in order to secure the right to паллиативный departure of high quality to be resolved, the transition to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, “I saw пациентку, which has spent 14 days in the separation of emergency, in harrowing болях, and no one has taken the necessary measures to make it easier for them.
I fear that patients want to die, only because they did not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I reported my онкологу that I прекращаю treatment, I replied that she regrets that I прекращаю struggle, tells it.
She told me is that my days are numbered!
There is no departure Всесильного
Dr. мартель estimates that 90% of patients who ask about death, медперсонал him, for what they did not live up to their request, after the team'паллиативному caring facilitates their pain.
However, it should be noted that the паллиативный departure is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain.
According to Элси Монро, director at паллиативному caring society паллиативного nursing home large Монреаля, patients are not susceptible to обезболиванию in 8% of cases.
In the end of life, doctors often resort to паллиативной седации, in which the patient is sleeping until his death, or from time to time, either.
No more pretending that we do not know about these suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to alleviate the pain, can have access to паллиативной седации.
Sick, suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But this does not necessarily mean “I want me to have an assisted death”, it means “I want me became easier.”
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to the журналистскому гранту research from the Institute of Health Canada.

Large-scale scandals with real estate in квебеке
Officials responsible for building roads, building contractors, сборщики funds political parties and specialists italian mafia day after day, tell what they know about the colossal “system”, опутывающей construction industry, civil servants, politicians, union activists and mafioso.
“Industry”, which are very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
“Curiously, as рассыпается this system after were monetized it all means, jokes Jacques Дюшено, MP and former chief of police Монреаля.”
It is thanks to him in 2011, the scandal erupted as the fallout from official investigations into crimes associated with дорожно - building contracts in квебеке, on which the Prime Minister of the time from liberals, Jean world, very reluctantly agreed.
“The report Дюшено” established a direct link between the industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, only one, the Department of Transportation would have kept the billion dollars in contracts,” if some holding their instincts to take share.
The Commission has already shifted its Шарбонно “two mayors,” he adds, hoping that it will “open schemes, behind individuals.”
A permanent unit to combat corruption, created in 2011
To подключилось created in 2011, the permanent unit to combat corruption, which includes a broad state government auditors, interrogators and analysts.
And, moreover, the staff special units “a ton”, which since 2009 has made “сточный картель” Монреаля, stop завышение value of contracts.
Over the past weeks had been undertaken a series of обысков, and some municipal officials, in particular франку Зампино and Ришару Маркотту - mayor of a small town, was charged in a fraud and corruption.
On-line жиль Вайянкур, late to resign from the office of mayor Лаваля, the third-largest city квебек province.
His suspect in неоднократном receiving bribes with government orders.
Moreover, the official indictment was indicted several engineers Service Railway Монреаля and building contractors of italian origin, including Tony Аккурсо and Лино Замбито.
The latest bomb, detonated a genuine поведав reflect about the “system” for public contracts.
In the next few years Замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts, in Montreal, некоему посреднику, captive with the mafia, which, in turn, переводил money Party mayor Жеральда Трамбле Монреаль “united”.
In the 2000's Замбито сорил money right and left more than 220,000. he listed canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties province, mostly liberals, who was then in power.
In addition, he admitted that illegally collected money for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party натали Нормандо.
Sanitation contracts, in which the value of завышали
In Montreal, “the system worked” corruption безотказно.
Жиль Сюрпренан, a former engineer for civil construction, explicitly described her before the Commission: in ten years, he has received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, on турниры on гольфу, in restaurants, on the hockey championship matches and bribes in total to 736 in exchange for sanitation contracts, the value of which he завышал.
Other officials responsible for building roads, admitting that were greased, завышая accounts for 30-40% with the help of fake дополнений.
Then one of the leading party mayor, Мартан Дюмон, accused Mr Трамбле that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget наполнявшего party кассы messy money.
After these revelations, Mr Трамбле resigned in early November, plunging Монреаль in deep crisis.
Шанталь Руло was one of the first MPS in Montreal, забивших alarm.
The mayor of district Ривьер - de - Прэри in the east of the island, she faces with the 2010 sale of municipal station, купленного for 5 million and $1.6 million for перепроданного … developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of the money in the pre-election campaigns
It says that in the investigation that eventually will be unleashed, it “потянет for ниточку, can understand the functioning of the system, кишащую муравьями to stop гангрену and to identify the guilty.”
This process it характерезует as “painful, but positive.”
We are in the process of cleaning up the wounds, but Монреалю will need its own inquisitorial and observer group, in order to avoid the return of dubious practices.
As we убираемся at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Дюшено notices for its part, that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but especially his concern about the role of the elected officials, знавших about this scheme”, but did not bring in the horse-trading.
Given that the share of money to fund an election campaign in квебеке reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told that it was merely бледное reflection of reality.”
The government of Quebec offers a limit to $100 donations to parties, but, in his words, it does not change the situation: “as long as we are not strictly limit elective spending, in politics are dirty money.”
It requires full adjustment system for allocating public contracts and financing parties: “we can't move below; boldly вникнув in nature of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story and casts a shadow over the international image of Quebec and Монреаля, Mr Дюшено urges those who смеется, look at its own Farm …

“ПСЖ - not фк Barcelona!”
This season you have achieved in ПСЖ необыкновенного scope.
As you объясните this growth?
This can be explained by the individual сознательностью, but can-and the new измерением ПСЖ.
Profit great players.
Next to them I расту every day.
Technical staff also much place.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football everything is happening very quickly.
But I'm not распаляюсь.
From the beginning, in the middle of the preliminary work in НИФ in Клерфонтене and before my arrival in Saint - Этьен I always шагал forward.
Thus, you извлекаете benefit from competition, established by Carlo Анчелотти …
Пополнению this summer, not the play matches very high levels.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to such a player, as I want to be on the level and выкладываться at maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Анчелотти lends support to my позиционировании.
His deputy, help such as Claude Макелеле, who played in the same position, and I.
Анчелотти - boss position?
Of course.
Анчелотти inspires respect to the technical staff.
Today, in the league, he has no equal in number, and he is the best coach in Europe.
He has vast experience, and he won with plenty of титулов высококлассными клубами.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles парижу.
In January I had with him was обнадеживающая conversations.
Then I отходил from a series of injuries.
The confidence that he has, I also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season ПСЖ?
In the first league лион took place in our leader.
But we are still ready for use.
One of our main objectives is the League champions: we said квалифицировались восьмую one in the final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll try to get as much as possible.
From now on, all can be.
We will be able to say to his word face-to-face with a very good european teams.
First, we want to finish first in our group, in Porto, in order to be able to accept a return match in one-eighth the final.
Whether ПСЖ become first-class european club in the short term?
It has to have the budget …
In order to become a major european club, парижу needs to win titles and cement position on a long-term view.
Today, this is not so.
Financially, the ПСЖ has the means to make the project viable.
Do not take the title in the league last season, will be the biggest failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we actual ardently desire to get this чемпионский title.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, was a disappointment, because we had all come to manage the first.
It was a very successful season.
We completed it with 79 очками.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But another team, Монпелье, played more фантастический season.
This year, I think, all will be in order.
Despite the fact that, in a fight for the title are such strong teams, as Marseille, лион Bardot and, I think, that we have the power to win.
Do you not think that the media expected too much from ПСЖ?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was FDI and what we have players.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we home выигрываем 4-0 against Труа and we still find that раскритиковать, of course, it is a little frustrating.
We ask, what the people expect more from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with accounts of 4-0.
We are not фк Barcelona!
We are trying to promote the game.
The team is over time.
We have proven in the league champions that can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester Юнайтед, which already has two season, failing to qualify for the final one восьмую, although they, too, have spent huge amounts of money!
Given that we put the amount you were 15 points ahead of already to зимнему перерыву.
This would be to neglect our opponents and the French.
Лион and Marseille, which did not rise to the occasion in the past season, were “awakened” this new ПСЖ.
This shows how увлекательна first League.
I hope that, in May, we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, and as a result we won.
ПСЖ seems to depend entirely on deeds Златана Ибрагимовича.
So what if, say, that there is some “Златанозависимость.”
It only means that ибрагимович very successful and that he beat a lot of goals.
He came to this and it shows that he is a star of the League.
Everywhere, where he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and star of world-wide.
As a group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has done, it really is.
It stimulates and others to improve their game.
Тьяго Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
As you have the Euro-2012 with a team of France?
As a disappointment.
I fervently wish to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my trauma prevented me grab a little playing time.
I saw there, many things, and I was there.
Today I was able to play a good отборочные matches.
This is what I hoped for since my крещения in blue.
We have learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine, and must now behave образцово.
What do you think about the first месяцах Дидье Дешама led blue?
They результативны for him.
It has a good position in отборочной group the world.
He's strict coach, he is close with the players, and encourages the victory.
What was Laurent Блан.
But I would not want to compare.
Блан reached its goal, he квалифицировал us into the euro.
I hope that Дидье Дешам lead blue in Brazil.
Good заслуженная draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain is the key match?
This match has given us the confidence in themselves.
Each fought for all.
Before the shock in Spain, in my career was not such games.

Pay and sell without the help of the banks-with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on центробанках, пронумерованных транзакциях between the parties they C комиссионными levies on processing them.
Moreover, as often happens with these technologies, a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, изобретенный Сатоши Накамото (nom de guerre), while at the same time is a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros …) and secure exchange of Protocol on the type of BitTorrent, which allows members to exchange файлами between one level.
About 200,000 operations have already been recorded with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites make биткойны for donations or as a tender.
The биткойна, reaching a peak at 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later, fell to $2, before the return today to roughly ten dollars (rates identifies the site bitcoincharts. com).
Nothing extraordinary in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report of a virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes the биткойн as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “a similar to the common currency”.
Биткоин is different from other types of virtual currencies, as a “credit” used to advance in видеоигре, which are made in the process of the game or who may buy (and sometimes and convert).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the operations of exchange controls and always обрабатывает any central authority.
In all Биткойн узлы networks are simultaneously the holders of the accounting books, аудиторами, currency issuers, покупателыми and sellers.
This network operates?
Each deal between two users actually happening between the two electronic адресами, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment users can choose the other allegations, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The set of information, concerned by the deal, struck электронно, using a system of шифрования with double the key.
The network can also verify the authenticity deals.
Thanks to содержимому файла may test that биткойны, used in the bargain, there really are in public счетной book разосланной throughout the network.
A key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
She is going through a solution of mathematical equations, разосланной решивший computers, which, as a temporary central bank, receives the privilege of adding this new строку.
It is about phase хэширования файла, converting large файла in digital signature, a brief and unique.
Computers “borrow” new транзакцию and add it to the number, before the “хэшировать” all together.
The goal is to find the number, which would give a unique digital signature (many нулей in early).
As soon as it is found, the number of other узлы easily verify that it correctly.
Транзакция thus proving нерарзрывно цепочкой associated with all other transactions; any modification of change digital signature.
If, with the aim of deception users very quickly (less than ten minutes) willing to pay twice the improvement and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be vindicated by the network — and the other would remain неподтвержденной, as they have different electronic подписи.
The computer, решивший task, receives 50 биткойнов.
To avoid inflation, the reward regularly share пополам, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of биткойнов in circulation so limited to 21 million, but they делимы стомиллионной to one that still leaves the Fed …
The complexity of the tasks also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced the ups and downs.
Sites, services Bitcoin, have been attacked, and биткойны were stolen from the reserves.
“Used by the defect is not for the protocol,” Pierre заверяет Нуаза, which recently launched Paymium-company осуществляющую payments real money using a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also told about the possibility of laundering money through this this анонимную service.
But the cash will also enjoy this flaw.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept the donation of this kind.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, their permit.
Recently Ади Shamir and Дорит Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed счетную book and found that almost 80% of биткойнов does not come in.
“The massive sell-off” were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars were swapped” радуется Йон Холмквист, working in Coinabul, which deals with конвертацией биткойнов in gold.
Pierre Нуаза, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or бесконтактного payment via mobile phone, but it uses to test the Bitcoin transactions, thus goes cheaply.
Обладатель better control of their personal data, and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not need to set new devices or software.
Just enough to tell us that can be “сфотографировать and recognizable” телефоном specifies, Pierre Нуаза worry that he has already has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to revise the hierarchical systems in favor of more горизонтальных.
“Before the Bitcoin утвердится, it will be for some time, but the year 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, incidentally, to reconsider the various risks, считающиеся now elevated, in the case of the success of this system.

We have gone from Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have pulled out of his area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Каписа and Суроби).
NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control of its own territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only to us.
The us has suffered in the Afghan peasants, which we regard as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 убитыми soldiers, and ранеными and покалеченными.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, the former commanders, скрывающихся in Pakistan, but also often of peasants, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as it was with the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and архаичные, even if they are joined by jihadis, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are suffering, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer, as only the West will behave more деликатно.
The departure of french troops from bases Ниджраб, which I observed from the standpoint of the засаженных миндальными trees, thanks to the french credit, took place in the order.
Конвои truck and бронетехники accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, not as атакованными.
With the end of 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
Circumstances have changed since their compelling advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and the blood of the struggle between the various factions.
Arresting them under the control of the country's then been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women until bigotry these farmers, in which their surpassed al-Qaeda, but their condition did not improve, and in these days.
The former моджахеды, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in подчиненном position.
The main characters anti-soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, exciting public lands to перепродать them under despite репатриантам, returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge american contracts субподряда.
They discredited; most of them, incidentally, even themselves are not at war.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, to the government, which has been one of the thieves would not.
Many young people want to leave, as уедут, those who managed to american generosity: a significant outflow of capital.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during his exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years in Kabul; now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
To provide jobs to these young people, who do not want to return to the old мракобесию no parties, no to corruption, some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed militias, like mobile phones, television and turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment the army is there.
The authorities, who will be pushed around by it, will be considered legitimate?
The old warlords, ведшие anti-soviet struggle, are already taking measures to rebuild the provincial broke, which would not abide by the central authorities.
Afghanistan, mountain country, with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent децентрализован, modeled on western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, targeted for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been thrown back on its feet, neither the dam does not function, no ирригационная system not отремонтирована.
All imported; nothing is produced, except for fruit and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control of infrastructure would be needed.
Rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral riches.
This has only strengthened the perception that western countries were present there, only to be captured.
Without energy recycling for iron ore and copper on the spot, without the means of transportation to their export through the mountains, there is no production, mineral resources.
The Chinese are already almost left the Aynak copper field Мес, leaving international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) раскапывать huge Buddhist complex and remain the biggest employers province.
Also, the need to one day equal way Afghanistan and Pakistan, which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of french combat troops is over 20 November.
The new agreement provides for the cooperation of preserving traditional aid: лицей for girls, for boys, a graduate of the french language in the University, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support археологической delegations.
Since 2009, in a quest to “win hearts and minds” and meet the impossible task of reconciling with наступательными aid operations, service “civil-military activities” at the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), упраздненная in 2012, along with a small french public institution that has contributed to numerous public activities and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain селений.
These jobs, with intensive welcoming local labor force, able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, protection of the soil and the increase in the area's arable land.
We will leave that to the memory of itself, having spent two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget посодействовал would improve the living conditions of the local population, very tough in these valleys, often rise to the occasion more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has written dozens of calls about the implementation of the small agricultural jobs that emanate from the local communities in the province of Каписа.
To get rid of the uprisings, руководимых foreign groups, which want to farmers, as I said, they need to put them to a small невоенную support, which could well контролировалась and going to them directly.

Difficult births of Egypt's constitution
This is a risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him an extraordinary powers, he decided to play by the Bank.
Застав everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of the state provided a collection of two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt relies on preliminary text, in which several times been amended, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.
In the view of his opponents, the president persists in its “autocratic бреду”, “continuing to violate the word” and “flout right.”
In the camp of his followers are convinced that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the process of transition.
The referendum should be held for 15 days.
A very short period of time, which makes the brothers to refuse to explain the intentions of the text of the article for egyptians, Article.
For the president, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent is raging across the country.
Mohamed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians vote positively, as he declared in one interview american еженедельнику Time.
The more that the call to fast-track vote like an ultimatum to the egyptian people: “either you голосуете for my text, or I оставляю itself extraordinary powers”, which, as expected, should be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals not откликнулось on challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their opinion.
Representatives of the defenders of human rights, religious minorities or civil society, have done the same.
To the necessary кворум was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the brothers-Muslims.
No surprise, then, that in most cases, the articles were проголосованы unanimously.
Комментаторов позабавил, incidentally, is the fact that one of the few differences emerged days around … time to pray, because some members of the committee thought that clock Constituent Assembly were wrong to set.
The text, which yesterday still go vote, is composed of 234 articles.
The object of attention, Article 2 ultimately remained identical to an article of the constitution of 1971, гласящей, that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law”.
Салафистские party, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main demands, hoped to replace the “principles” on the “rules” that would give them the opportunity to more rigorous application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy”, say the liberals, who see in this a public relations.
Because, in their view, the Islamization constitution happening through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which grants the University of al-Azhar консультативную role, in particular, in terms of verifying compliance with laws шариату.
According to specialist on Egypt софи Помье, this is worrying, because “the people that are supposed to make the decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can see the emergence of theocracy.”
Many liberals, moreover, взбудоражены fact that the next president of this university, it seems, will be far less moderate than the current.
“At the moment there is no particular religious interference.
With this constitution we remain within the civil rights.
Most of the lawyers who worked on these texts are not ulamas, and people with a university education, some trained by the french system” - reassures Блое Alexis, who is preparing a thesis on egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that “around Article 220-digit can emerge, as used in terms of religious заимствованы лексики.
This applies in particular to the “фикх” [Islamic law, прим ред.].
And, in the future, could emerge, the question of how civilian judges competent to pass judgment on this.”
Aside from its religious aspects, the text passed yesterday, is subject to criticism, because it gives the sweeping powers of the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood, argue that they have significantly reduced compared with those which have been under the old regime.
Another moot point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget is not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.
Also not be blocked by the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests from the association to protect human rights.
The past also expressed concerns about the text, which they believe in freedom.
Saved the responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth forbidden to insult, that could have serious implications for freedom of expression, and especially for the freedom of the press.
Moreover, none of the articles are no longer talks about protecting women, highlights Хеба Мораеф, from Хьюман Райтс Вотч.
In her words, the only positive moment marks the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word, which had arisen in the previous constitution.
While the egyptian president was supposed to speak yesterday evening on television, манифестации scheduled today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

Заходишь in it – and оказываешься in absolute darkness.
Мерцают stars.
And it is the names of the children – the Jews and the title of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine there, too, is mentioned.
Оздоровиться
Three major курортные zone of Israel are located on the coasts Средиземного, red and a dead sea.

Better to take the money in a trip is not in the euro, and in dollars, which can easily be exchanged for шекели (now 1-3.8 шекеля).
Urban transport – mainly buses, but in Jerusalem is fast трамвай, and in хайфе is the only country in the subway line, consisting of six plants and has a city with верхним.

“The great and mighty” to Moscow over: migrants копят money on language
As long as the MPS and lawyers argue that the law would give about обязательном linguistic testing, in a country already appeared rogues, selling “липовыми сертификатами”
Each year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities, Russia's coming 13 million guest workers.
The majority of the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only aim is to earn money to support the families of the remaining at home.
From 1 December entry into force of the law, according to which each worker мигрант owes will lose the exam on knowledge of the russian language.
As long as this usually works only for those who intend to work in the service sector, жилищно - communal beings, agriculture and retail trade.
Over time, however, the promise in ФМС, tests will become compulsory for all coming.
It will have to lose not only the language, but Russia's history, and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of language will have to affirm and to gain, and to extend permission to work.
An exception is only for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is the language of the state.
Not elude law and people get успевшие аттестаты and degrees of education until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, обреченность and protection of human rights
The network экзаменационных points will work under the auspices of the Institute of russian language name Pushkin, the University of Friendship, мгу СПбГУ, and other russian college.
Migrants will cede tests in all cities; now in Russia for more than 160 such centers.
The initiative of the tests supported and MPS, and госдумы ФМС.
And here are the lawyers, before the law came into force, too many times in the press to ask the question: what, exactly, will it?
That will change that knowledge of language and for Russians, and for themselves a visitor?
Above all, the reply of migration services, this will reduce the number of people suffering from “labor slavery.”
A lot of talk now about protecting the rights of labor migrants, поясняет ФМС Russia's chief representative in Tajikistan, Viktor Себелев.
The protection of their rights must start before their departure.
The system will allow only organized set of 90% of the foreign workers.
The problems are the migrants without the profession, education, not knowing the language, not a medical освидетельствования.
Without an understanding of the language, is confident Себелев, future мигрант is bound to face недобросовестными people who, under the guise of helping him “всунут путёвку” in жуткий тесный Barack, where he and dozens of his kind will be months томиться without food and documents, вкалывая on 12-14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
“At home they promise one thing and to приезду bilking them, imposes passports, do not pay the promised wages,” confirms chief chief of labor migration мс Tajikistan Толиб шарипов.
Not ругайся, насяльника!
Nevertheless, while many citizens среднеазиатских republics, gathered on the commercial opportunities in Russia, is that not only does not know the language of the country, in which aspire to, but on its own it is hard to write.
Of course, this is not so much their wines, but the problem: few malleable, Uzbeks, Tajiks, can afford to get even толковое primary education.
After all, their families even to feed their children, let alone to decently, and their одевать обувать снаряжать in school.
Дорастая before подросткового age, these guys at the first opportunity sent on earnings.
It is difficult, if not with a knowledge of the language, they admit.
“Чувствуешь and incomplete.”
True, in the law's language lawyers point out one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the same status-there will be no экзамена, nor the subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, much of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
“You are welcome, or outsiders log воспрещен”
Many of the Visiting argue that to get official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is in the bureaucratic препонах and all those same linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization is worth the money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And that is the fake registration can be done quickly and in just one-and-a - half thousand.
The staff of the russian police know that we have mostly fake documents, hence there is no registration, and cases of extortion.
“Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea,” reflected with journalists citizen Tajikistan Умед Хушкадамов.
“Налетай, not скупись, Buy painting”
In the first day of membership in the force of law about language, фальшивыми are not only мигрантские documents about the registration.
A few “липовых” to buy certificates of Test linguistic tests already изъяты ФМС employees.
Spurious отпечатаны paper on the usual цветном принтере.
Of course, they could be holding the new owners not задаром: each of the migrants, надеявшихся thus ease the task of passing the tests, it has paid for the document's seven thousand rubles.
In this two-plus times more expensive procedures of the formal tests: it would cost labor мигранту in three thousand.
That is the task of the soon-to protect the system from corruption, to “корочки” cannot be simply buy converge, and representatives of the authorities, and lawyers.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise гастарбайтерам, not сумевшим successfully undergo testing times, with the first time to study the basic языкового rate.
Moreover, приезжим, not russian, who will be предлагаться work in areas not suggest active communication with the people.

The interior ministry is not in the turnover of illegal arms market
The share of crimes with the introduction of legal weapons extremely low
Russia's interior ministry proposes to tighten the law in relation to the owners of the civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: нажать silent on свадьбах when, without the victims, and slaughter, Moscow's lawyer Dmitry виноградовым, as a result of which нажать killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of травматики in public places and raise the age from which one can get a license to weapons-from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea of the proposed, head of the Duma committee on security and counter corruption ирина яровая and promised that the amendments in the law about weapons do in Госдуму soon.
Not everyone is happy that the russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “закручивания screws.”
In a letter, which the authors-representatives of various public стрелковых organizations-require to abandon the “senseless tightening.”
The percentage of registered weapons хулиганства with minimal, said the russian service, the BBC's lawyer - криминалист Vasily forest rangers charged with.
According to the statistics of the interior ministry, the six months of the 2012 $committed crimes with gunshot, recorded in the interior, while all over the same period recorded 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of an open letter, confident that the tightening of legislation in the area of civil weapons not put offenders go on a “black market”.
Now, they say, in Moscow can find any weapons to not really high price.
Meanwhile, in the interior ministry argue that control the situation with the spread of illicit weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black market” weapons пополняется through a variety of channels.
The main such channels five, tells a colonel in the resignation of Viktor баранец, ten years проработавший structure in the Department of Education and генштабе.
Скриншот site that takes orders for weapons
The first is “the army or military footprint”, that is, the weapons, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“Weapons тащили and russian officers, and кавказцы themselves,” says баранец.
This kind of “black” - weapons stolen criminals from representatives of the power structures.
Баранец поясняет that this includes and унесенные with police складов, and stolen directly from the staff of law-enforcement agencies.
Illegal “стволы” has its roots in the sale with military складов.
For many military pick often have exploded.
“There is a version of the proven that part of s-were made specifically to укрыть недостачу”, says the former military.
For its part, according to баранца, hidden weapons manufacturers.
“Now плодятся private arms factory, which not only 12.2 on the international market and emits weapons from flooring on the black market, including Moscow,” tells the expert.
Another source of “black-market smuggling.”
Especially many пистолетов автоматов and come from poor countries, for example, Киргизии.
“There is its production, sometimes кустарное, and a mafia, which sent a stream,” поясняет former military.
Where the weapons?
Experts thought, roughly what share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.”
A report on this in 2011, drew up the center of the troubled analysis and public-managerial design.
Experts analyzed the MVD, accountability and Росстата криминологическую literature and open data порталов gun on topics.
By far the largest part of the illicit weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and power networks.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there “to officials, whose work is linked with weapons,” said the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the cases, the weapons come from the seats of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur хищения on stage production of weapons, 5% in the “black археологию.”
The seller is a consultant to one of weapons stores, попросивший not call it the name, pledging that weapons, найденное black копателями, long ago nobody buys is too old.
More often than not, as he says, for a new party sellers go on military storehouse.
Through прапорщика man buys unit, for example a pistol тт.
He give her, transmit through заборчик.
“He flies in the city and sells here for 900 euros for штуку with two shops,” he tells
“The truth is that the police in the course of all, so periodically when burning plan for раскрываемости crimes, a procurement controls the traffickers illegal weapons,” adds consultant.
“As in a store.”
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through the unknown.
I заглядывал on sites, in blogs, does not yet have comrade, who offered to come on a platform of “беговая”, where will people who увезет me in the corner of”, where we will bargain.
Price ствола I learned only there.
The military observer Viktor баранец
To get ствол me a familiar, in which there is a way out, tells a seller-consultant. — I have an acquaintance there, but I do not believe in it.
Sellers in the markets is, but there also needs to be replaced, relatively, “from Ivan ивановича, who asked to have a tooth дочки had.”
I now even a couple of кастетов достаю through human, in which certain.
He, too, is supplying them only to me, because it knows that I not сдам.
New entrants are seeking weapons differs.
The former military Viktor баранец already itself in the role of the buyer, illegal weapons in the mid-1990's, when groomed for the publication of an article about this.
Schemes, he says, has not changed.
He gave альбом with фотографиям, where “was all that happened.”
“I feel like in a store,” recalls the military.
Bidder, according to баранца, do not offer cat in мешке - all we can try.
I, a potential client, not simply buying-we едем with the seller in the forest, there are posing a target.
“Give me an opportunity to shoot, and when I убеждаюсь that weapons hitting well, are starting to bargain,” describes the procedure expert.
Shop on диване
Поисковики Internet address on websites and groups in “Вконтакте”, where the offer to buy weapons “for different purposes.”
This does not need no documents and personal meetings.
“Enough to have a certain amount of money,” written in advertising on the site of the “Fighting шапке bought a pistol or a machine gun.”
The users leave their application and asking questions.
But несовершеннолетним can sell?
“Without a license, of course,” asks users “Ivan” (орфография saved).
“Куплю тт. moscow” - tersely formulates the request “Федоренков.”
The Federal Security Service now разбросила huge network of fake sites and want to buy a gun battle гребет лопатой.
People go, as голодная fish on прикормку, and then drill in Siberia, coal
The military observer and former military Viktor баранец
I heard about such schemes: usually the site recorded outside the actions of Russia's laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer through the ATM produces pay.
“In response to the photo and присылают инструкцию, where спрятано weapons,” tells a press secretary of the “right to arms” Dmitry Кислов.
Victor баранец argues that leaving a bid on the site, can be without weapons and being put behind bars.
The Federal Security Service now разбросила huge network of fake sites and want to buy a gun battle гребет лопатой.
“People go, as голодная fish on прикормку, and then drill in Siberia, coal,” he argues.
Makarov for $100
With the purchase of the illicit стрелкового weapons experts, can be уложиться in $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Кислова from the “right to weapons,” a pistol макарова can purchase a 100-300 dollars.
Will have to wait a month-and a half.
He отгружается складов with long-term storage leadership these складов middle management.
According to the official стастистике departments, compared with the January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia has fallen by 7% and amounted to 22,9 thousands, and the number of выявленных хищения facts and extortion of weapons, ammunition, and explosives взрывчатых substances has fallen to 7.8%.

In the US, the бастуют фастфуда workers and supermarket
Through work on “кассе макдоналдс” by up to a quarter of all american teenagers
In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages in универмагах corporations Walmart and fast-food restaurants popular networks, such as “макдоналдс”, “Бургер King”, “Тако Bell,” “Уэндис” and “Kentucky фрайд чикен.”
As long as no one takes predict, into whether this surge in the ninth вал or it is to expire in the early stages.
Stocks support trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries, which receive rank-and-file employees of Walmart, and a system of fast food, suggested the protests is the creation of their trade union organizations.
As long as this sector is not gripped by trade union movement.
46 cents in a year?
Stocks began last week, the day after благодарения, in the so-called “black Friday”, when America crashed orgy of cheap распродаж захватившая, millions of “Street and sometimes сопровождавшаяся потасовками.
To this day, some workers corporations Walmart, in which around the world hard 2.2 million people, have left their jobs and пикетировали together with the trade unions and left-wing activists shops corporations, whose product расчитан on modest and middle-income people.
Walmart sells all the light, from пеленок, охотничьих ружей and car thermal energy to пылесосов, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in the major supermarkets.
So many-paid employees of Walmart отовариваются only on paper.
Availability and range of goods made Walmart, one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell cheap goods, in part because little is paying their workers.
The past also complain about working conditions, for example, on the lack of автопогрузчиков or live hand сканеров.
Participants in the “black Friday” required to raise wages and grumbled about the cost of health insurance, to borrow the corporation, spiking from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Типичному worker Walmart, получающему 9.5 dollars per hour, this costs unaffordable, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley, argue that if Walmart will boost среднуюю salary to 12 dollars per hour, it would cost the corporation to 3.2 billion dollars.
This is roughly 1.1% more than it spends on pay now.
If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth at the expense of buyers, each visit to the shop will do them all to 46 cents more expensive.
For a year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart fairly note that protests have occurred only in nine states and corporations have no малейщего damage.
“Black Friday” to continue in its stores from 8 p. m. on Thursday, before midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of its кассовые boats produced in “black Friday” almost 100 million transactions.
A representative of the corporations Deng Фогелман argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post that jobs have left a total of “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the action of protest has been all - навсего “another пиаровским трюком” организовавшего its trade union.
“Free касса!”
The protests continued into this week in New York, where their target were not универмаги Walmart (in this progressive city not жалуют, and so their here as long as there is no), and “макдоналдсы” and other cheap restaurants.
Макдоналдс says that it sells billions порций, and after that he does not even gives you the hospital and not paying you for an honest job!
Джумейн Williams, a member of the New York City горсовета
At this moment, the minimum salary, according to the federal and New York law is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast-food restaurants, over time, its pricing, but only, and on average they rank-and-file workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
Fewer of them in this expensive city does not make one.
How can you be in New York on such money, for me, is inconceivable.
Once through “макдоналдсы” was nearly a quarter of american teenagers who подрабатывали for their прилавками after school, living with the parents.
Few who saw in the main source of table or planned задержаться there for a long time.
Now, I am constantly наталкиваюсь on interviews with workers “Макдоналдсов”, who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even to feed her children.
On the other hand, the Forum newspaper Wall Street Journal hangs comment, which the author observes that irresponsible kids, if you don't know what you will have to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6.30 in the morning Thursday, the “Макдоналдса” 40-68 on the street and Madison-avenue, demanded that кассирам поварам system and fast food began to pay a minimum of $15 per hour, that is more than the current minimum have doubled their salaries.
They also demanded that the fast food were created labor organizations.
American law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration has rarely made it easier for them to life.
But now, the trade union rapid nutrition is difficult and for subjective reasons.
One of the main-extraordinary churn ordinances.
Несогласные
The tumultuous protests took place in this day and a number of other low-cost restaurants in Manhattan.
The climax was the stock in mid-day rally in “Макдоналдса” near Times Square, which is opposed by several local democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the горсовета Джумейн Williams, stated: “макдоналдс” says that it sells billions порций, and after that he does not even gives you the hospital and not paying you for an honest job!”.
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent and the New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the city, Bill de Бласио, stated that, “we must дружно join in support of workers fast food that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every New York йоркец!”.
As охарактеризовала what the New York Times, this was the biggest event of this kind in the history of american fast food.
But it involved only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid общепита, which in New York with tens of thousands of people.
So far, it is not clear whether this would generate искра flame mass movement.

“As long as it is a medium to fool the brain”
Popular among fans of modern technology topic дополненной reality in the recently adopted seen mostly through the prism of special eyeglasses.
At first, the summer on its annual conference operating model has shown Google, and then in November it was known that bid for the corresponding patent applied and Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with a group of online 3D-technology in Кэмбриджской lab Microsoft Шарамом Изади follows that for scientists this company score - пройденный phase.
Their beckons the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air, bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
- Расскажите, please, in broad outline, what does your research group?
Are we doing human interaction with cars, but with this attempt to раздвинуть borders this interaction.
As long as mankind in part застряло on stage work with пикселями on flat screen, sometimes тыканья in them the finger.
We just want to look at the 5-10 years ahead and foresee the drastic change in this engagement.
For example, приставка сенсоры Xbox and Kinect is a step forward, and almost no one now Xbox Kinect is not for sale, after all, without all the interesting жестовое management.
Is that still awaits us ahead?
- Despite the fact that Kinect have endured the interaction on a physical level, much still happening on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The improved system gets more information (data), and the conclusion is not very.
We are trying to change that, working on a truly трехмерными отображения systems on the basis of the various technologies, including проективных.
To be released in the computer world, our physical, make it more physical.
For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place-to hell these дурацкие шлемы virtual reality!
What do you think about голосового management?
The popular штука, but not переоценивают is it?
It certainly is not a panacea, the question arises приватности, because not always wants извещать surrounding about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interacting with computers are good, but everyone in their нише.
For example, for the management of устройствами in public places there was a project in which we thought of gestures, but not over размашистыми, and over such parsimonious, short.
With gestures filmed not cameras device, and наручным браслетом that фиксировал for movement and muscle.
As long as he is a big, but in theory it could be reduced to the size of наручных hours.
But in general, the future for mixed type of management, for example, a gesture of + voice.
Is it both?
— For example, how can you ask me to pass on to you the bank газировки?
You say and simultaneously покажете.
“I usually just say.
- About, it will be very difficult to identify.
There is something you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not, for the moment, the machine?
Is not necessarily, but this mutual rapprochement.
I think, in the short time we mostly have to work on the development of new types of сенсоров, which will allow more accurately determine people's reaction.
It may be, for example, лазерные сенсоры, they provide a good resolution on the surface, this is very important.
If the talk about your work with сенсорами Xbox Kinect, which you claim to modern камерам?
Lacks the depth of the resolution, or even something?
In principle, the current generation is what you can build in our work over трехмерным распознаванием.
Of course, the well would get мегапикселей 8 speed to / with.
But it's not in themselves мегапикселях, and as матрицы and depths.
With the last point of view, all current technologies for us is not enough good-it adds to the work проектировщикам algorithms.
Then there is need to remember not only the pro-settlement осям X and Y and Z's house.
It is also very important that the speed of the number of employees in the second.
The man is a dynamic, and the current 30 to / with frankly маловато, especially for the gesture.
Steven Бетишес from our Рэдмондской lab made сенсор касания with regulated delayed processing-from 1 to 100, with modern мс серийные сенсоры closer to the second (60-100) figures.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would in my work very пригодился equivalent of such a device, not only requires касаний to employees in the second was more.
– And the number of cameras increase does not need to be?
In Kinect now has three “cameras”, one of which actually - инфракрасный излучатель, and the second sink for reflected signal.
And this is already the third camera-that is, indeed, the usual сенсор visible spectrum.
It is not applied to determine the depth of the facility.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem …
Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible counterpart, with Kinect поиграться кривизной location of cameras and look, as this will help in determining трехмерном position.
— Remember how, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not презентовала public their points.
You are not, it seems that from the point of view of routine use of technology дополненной reality points – this is one of the most promising platforms?
Of course, the all-time разгуливать, tossed смартфон in raised hands, not very comfortable, but this is what I think: the steep option would be “переходящая” дополненная reality when, on the basis of a cloudy platforms you would increasingly turn to points on смартфон, проекционный дисплей and then everywhere.
Points are very personal device, in that their power (приватные things you see only), and at the same time weakness - дополненная reality on the basis of points would not allow you to work on virtual objects, together with other people.
Imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual голографическими objects in the air, available not only Tony старку from “Iron man”, but simple and death.
There is one problem, critics often point to the idea: there is no тактильного recall!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers your group is preparing for this challenge?
In his lecture, I often say that дополненная reality is the seventh-a breakthrough in the compact human and machine.
I think that may well be the eighth добавка тактильных fever.
In the meantime, one of the more interesting tricks the use of second-hand as a mechanism for подложки images.
She famously registers нажатия!
But there is also a technology that really are aimed at giving here is this “in the air” картинкам осязаемости - for example, интерференция several designed ультразвуковых rays in a certain point where палец, gives a sense of, but it is very weak-as if you подули on подушечки.
There is also a браслеты on wrists from that affect nerve endings in the fingers are also promising.
As you tried to deceive the brain?
To think that he feels that would like to feel at the moment when he sees something?
Is this a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
Here is another task, which is to beat long-how to make human, physically being in a very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost unending-work and over the concepts of the running tracks (not, such as in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge шаров.
As long as the fool the brain is a medium, work is still very much for many years.
This is what makes the work on a virtual reality so attractive to researcher-many things is in its infancy.

Вкусовщина instead of culture - Росбалт SA.
“Росбалт” continues to project “петербургский vanguard,” горожанам, who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and the arts.
In the list of top 100-are already under bright figures арт - scenes of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding acceptance in Europe, bypassing всероссийскую fame.
The new hero of “Росбалта” - эпатажный artist кирилл миллер.
The whole town knows кирилла miller theorem-bearded man dressed in all the Red, which meets the russian museum, the year-old care services, the fashionable parties and вернисажах.
The pictures кирилла miller theorem always collect hordes of viewers, where would they not выставлялись.
Кирилл миллер - one of the very петербургских socio-philosophical сказочников, creators of new мифологий.
Кирилл миллер is a man петербургского avant garde of the late 1980's-of the early 1990s.
Moreover, he is a man of cities, its emergence on the streets is causing his smile from citizens, поднимающий all mood.
He recently took in the hands of шарманку and became петербургским шарманщиком, as ripe for this complex role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image.
- Кирилл, and why do you still ходишь city on the red, and not in the Yellow or бирюзовом, for example?
“I chose the red color as модельер, in appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a compromise between художником имиджмейкером, and society.
Although in a society that is perhaps not серое, aggression and excitement недоброго properties.
But my provocations designed to began speaking.
The whole history of my stock is an invitation to a provocative debate.
— And, when you see that must be художником?
At an exhibition in DC невском, where were выставлены my work.
I realized that this is my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists has gone, and the new, free like me were uncertain.
I became дружить with a new wave of artists, with постгазоневщиной, which led to the “пушкинской - 10”, and more of it.
I quit in theater, the clothes, the music, all жанры, beyond words.
And all of this is united in your Арт - clinic … - I was important очутиться in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where should gather all the best of the creative forces.
In 1995, I took on the territory of пушкинской - 10, and as long as there was no repairs, existed музыкально - артистический club, богемный Club, home of the St. Petersburg богемы.
Many there resulted: НОМы, Tequila-jazz, remember, as шнура led with the project of “Van Gogh's ear.”
Cord and his friends sang under фанеру easy songs, they were in обтягивающем трико, among them was a trendy now композитор Igor Вдовин.
When a group of заиграла живьем, it became “ленинградом.”
Трахтенберг was the leading many programs to хали - галивских days.
We gave them Трахтенберга, and his great career has gone, and базовое education and training he received from us.
Галерея “D”, “грибоедов 137 club-it echoes from Арт - clinic.
There, our workers and habitués are gone.
I hero of yesterday's century, when culture that matter.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was “the people of our city.”
In “the artist's nomination,” has been named I, my кончилась кульминация.
In the new to the old rules неуютно work, I people the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to be popular, but the culture and popularity are shared, can be popular, but not cultural.
- Твоим activities have recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings is хиты, they vividly expressed urgency and the sharpness.
I will be programmatic exhibition, “Russian Museum in клоунах.”
Клоуны - вневременная category.
I used was social, now to be so-it is painful and misfortune.
But, in all, the tragic irony клоунах размазывается снимается.
I love гротеск, I have гротесковые ideas.
For example, saving the world by totalitarian переодевания приказном in order.
Now одежке encounter, preparing to target foreign the mechanics, not on internal human.
But his hand and should not be set in рожу плюнуть need.
And fraud will be withdrawn by переодевания.
- And recently we saw you in the role of urban шарманщика. - cultural city should have such a hero.
Those who, like me, they will not be.
Well-can and commercial art can be beautiful?
Now the commercial art should be аккуратным, тактичным, sweet.
Is the disintegration of cultures.
People used to flock, сбивались богема любила простаки, one another.
Now, all are falling on микросообщества, now it is difficult to like it all.
I'm not стодолларовая бумажка to all love.
Now need to think who is love.
Now everyone культового hero to 100 fans.
– And on стаса михайлова comes to a few thousand!
Is he coming брошенки сексо, there is the social sphere works.
But on the cultural rifts 300 people will come, and 10 evictions. not come, and in the end, less management, money, all stunted.
I have admirers, above all, not to deceive, not vandalize нажитое.
I wrote in his youth such pictures, that one коллекционера they on the wall alongside Фальком and ларионовым висели.
I began with the pictures, which usually finish.
Now often confuse concept.
Report: spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of the consumption, this from the other operas.
I'm a man of culture of yesterday's day, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and die in poverty, abandoned the money for the sake of рисования pictures.
I have for this is culture.
- Кирилл lacks петербургу?
The good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from the culture.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
With the right царях all was, hardship, may not be understood in the culture, but they understood that the need to keep the right experts.
This is in Moscow is now good consultants.
We have the leverage, there are people who could be experts, but they задвинуты, as need higher experts who correctly assess these experts and offer them the way.
Now thrives вкусовщинка.
The same Эрарта, but they emphasize that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept that there are such artists, who must seek the other museums.
Is that for you-St. Petersburg?
Petersburg-this is not the cultural capital of culture, in Moscow, there are far more ground.
And on our камнях art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soils, and we have now more writers than readers, that is wrong.
Here in Europe, the very many people любопытствующих. either on the exhibition, concerts.
We have the same tier тонок.
We need to make the fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project implemented by means of grant St. Petersburg

Birth in space
Land in danger.
Global warming or clash with an asteroid collision-killer.
Караваны space ships with землянами aboard sent in search of запасной planet.
To save humanity, raised the question of how to continue its reproduction in conditions невесомости or on the same planet запасной?
I think that choice is low.
In fact, only two real planets that can explore a hypothetical.
“This венера and Mars,” believes H of the astronomical public institution named P.K. Штернберга (ГАИШ) Vladimir Сурдин.
But if conditions on mars more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus-temperature 500 degrees.
You can only live at great heights or on the orbiting Venus … in outer space.
Approach to matters of reproduction in space began with flora.
Even half a century ago, conducted experiments on the plants.
Four generations of flowers in pea plants grown on orbit is no different from the types.
Then-getting into orbit, no tiny плодовых flies-fruit flies.
In 1979 in space have sent перепелок eggs, to verify, as the embryo develops in a невесомости.

But a further problem begins.
“The problem with the fact that this птенец should find a toehold, it must rely on its ножки and start moving,” поясняет заведующий laboratory Institute health biological problems (ИМБП) injuries, Vladimir сычев.
Not finding a toehold, птенцы randomly кувыркались.
And in 10 hours, the newborn was full атрофия instincts.
Птенцы not to react to light and breath.
And there was the point that, through four суток they simply погибали.
“And the two times we вылупляли птенцов, after it refused, because there is simply impossible to work with them,” - the failure of an experiment with Vladimir сычев птенцами in space.
The last time with animals biological “миниковчег” flying in orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
But on “биоспутнике Бион” will be the only gay species.
Was the experiment with rats that посылались in space with a fetus.
In principle, there is not a supernatural found nothing.
“It's just been on биоспутниках, but again-this is an isolated experiment, and such research should be conducted,” notes Vladimir сычев.
After landing from space rats have offspring.
But to approach the issue of reproduction directly in space as long as it is not.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing, customary habitats, simply could not realize their sexual instinct.
The same people, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is in a position to create подобающий emotional backdrop.
On ethical grounds such experiments.
But women in space would fly for 50 years.
The biggest risk was the Tereshkova's.
And the most precious, that have the humanity, is a woman's body.
Our чайка улетела, and no one on earth could not say whether he will continue after the fly in space.
Whether it is the child after the birth of the air.
“After all, on this issue, no one is in charge,” says veteran ракетно - space industry вахтанг Вачнадзе.
In June 1964, just one year after the fly in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova all дочку.
The father of a child Андриян николаев also was a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman: светланы савицкой, twice побывавшей on orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, a son was born.
But the risk remains.
We have a few units, there are astronauts, after long flights all cost, and growing healthy generation.
“And if more, this is dangerous even under орбитальных полетах,” summarizes летчик - cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, Russia's hero валерий Poles.
And yet, we need to find some new way in биотехнологиях, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.
Гидролаборатория цпк - binding phase of training to flying.
Here in terms of zero плавучести astronauts отрабатывают skills to work in an open space.
The water mimics невесомость.
If the water for adults, albeit комфортная, but still чуждая environment, for грудных children-birth стихия.
Small ихтиандры if confirm-life on сушу withdrew from the ocean.
There is a link between what the baby is around 9 months, moms in окоплодной fluid, it's easier to get used to the then водичке.
In principle this is logical, because from the moment the birth, from the moment the first купания, is just 2 weeks.
“This is very little, to forget something,” says instructor грудничкового плавания марина аксенова.
In short, if a child born невесомость more natural condition, for women's needs, the strength of the gravity of gravity.
Very quickly in невесомости дряхлеют muscle живота, таза, declining ability to выталкиванию fetus.
Ah, Or опустим and this, relying on стимуляторы родовой activities.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on giving birth, chasing it.
“And beyond that?” asks questions нетривиальные валерий Poles.
On the other hand, the child, too, need an artificial gravity.
Not feeling the gravity, the body does not form a skeleton and мышечную system.
The emerging on orbit is impossible, as an adult, in a special одеть нагрузочный suit for training.
He will simply be stripped of that it will be vital.
“And this experiment, in which we work with you, with the birth of a child in чужеродной environment, will lead to what we привезем on land received дезадаптированного fully human,” sees the head of the Committee on Bioethics ИМБП wounds Igor пестов.
As long as the birth of children in space – the theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality, when земляне on their кораблях head on a distant planet, which will be home to their offspring, born in space.

The military chief of the main checkpoints ревизионного management: checking шварц - system failed due to the politicians.
In the industry, the Czech Republic has a good government procurement agencies control and, despite the availability of quality legislation, has lagged in its application.
This statement Miroslav кала, vice-president of the Supreme checkpoints ревизионного management, from an interview for the site Aktuálně. cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but he must correctly applied, which, in my opinion, we are lacking,” commented the present кала.
Such conclusions provides joint inspection czech and german regulators.
As an example of the wrong approach Peter Нечаса practices lead to so-called шварц - system.
Recently, the Prime Minister announced that гдп (Civic Democratic Party) will not be concerned about entrepreneurs audits-goes it is banned or permitted?
“The law should be somehow appropriate, and if it is something bans, and the Prime Minister may not stand up to the workings of the institutions, which are expected to remain the responsibility of audit and seek to meet their obligations,” an кала.
At the meeting, ревизионного committee in the Chamber of Deputies you разговаривали about a joint project between the Czech and the german parties, within the framework of which was сопоставлено legislation for public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
Had in mind the parallel review that we began, perhaps, two years ago.
Simply put, it suggests that european legislation says, how should undergo public procurement, it follows the national legislation and then also use in practice.
All of the information was собрана and, even with the still unfinished test, surfaced interesting differences-simply put, the legislation we can be “precise and безошибочное”, but in practice we use on some measures, give in to Germany.
It follows, therefore, that is not enough to create more and more уточненные rules, must focus on the application of the law.
As well as the project can help you, what it means for you?
It is such a joint control can contribute to efforts to halt qualifications laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not result in a positive outcome.
Economy means obtaining appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) the low price, in order to avoid the enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we achieve this, lowering the limit orders.
Perhaps this system переполнится “bonds”, so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, they will find much easier than if the limit is not diminished.
You talk about the internal problems of practical use legislation on public procurement.
But as the system functions control in Germany?
There is there such a body as our КРУ (checkpoints ревизионное management) or it works differently?
As for the institutions, there as our КРУ opposes Bundesrechnungshof, by our principle, there is also a panel, generating a little differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the authority to a certain extent are similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are divisions in auditing and on the level of federal land-that their system is somewhat different from our own.
BRH can manage only the federal money, the state means we have at hand.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal счетных Chambers.
As for the local legislation, there are easier than the us?
Indeed, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects, Germany could serve as a model, but it can certainly say that it is better for everyone.
This is so because they are dealing with better control?
Certainly not, but повторюсь, such comparisons don't like me.
But to say that even образцовые countries faced with many challenges.
Otherwise, they would not have received no benefits from our cooperation with офисом, right?
If talking about domestic legislation, as were reflected in your institution, the amendment to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short, it still does not show in our work to control.
So as we are implementing controls on the need to take account of the fact that some of the delays.
Take this into account only in the process of preparing the future tests, we have begun to use our new tool “detection of risk неэкономности”, through which we turned away almost 14,000 public contracts we examine their... there, of course, these changes will manifest itself, because the change in the cap, change the conditions of some types of tenders and so on.
As you see, the claim that the law will benefit or an extra burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is, of course, a step in the right direction, and, I hope, it is confirmed.
The problem, which may arise, that the rules “ужесточатся” and they will be impossible to comply with.
With the operation of the previous rules-controlled enterprises повязаны with provider (for example, the regional operational program — with the Regional Council) that any to uphold the law on public procurement means of fiscal discipline.
Whether in such a case, strengthen the law in this way?
I think that's not in this way.
The system should be ruled out, those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit the mistake, not on the formal влияющую decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then, as out of this situation?
Let's recognize that this path will lead nowhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister announced that гдп will not be concerned about entrepreneurs audits of the so-called шварц system. — what does that mean?
“Schwartz-system” is prohibited or resolved?
The law should be somehow appropriate, and if it is something bans, and the Prime Minister may not stand up to the work of regulators, who are expected to remain the responsibility of audit and seek to meet their obligations.
We can say: “we поменяем this law and this разрешим”, but you cannot say that, let's pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains a fairly strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is right that will protect the public procurement..
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when a candidate with the best proposal disqualified only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but he must correctly applied, which, in my opinion, we are lacking.

Shimon Орнест: on концертах we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about that, less than a month must be brought about the end of the world?
It is only one of many troubling news on which we, the people, so it is easy to попадаемся.
Together with a group of the Tap Tap we constantly шутим on this issue and say that we are the only group in the world, which is able to collect enough positive energy, to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give a completely unique three концерта against the end of the world.
Could we tell you about this readers?
It is about the national event fundraising, which we планируем here is already within two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has a calendar майя, about the end of December 21, which declared at 11: 10.
The day before the event, the 20th December in 21: 00 parallel стартуют three концерта in Prague, and Брно Остраве.
They come to an end, roughly speaking, at the moment, when on the island Кирибати in the Pacific Rim, the hour at which the 12 hours before we have completed, майский calendar.
Those who came to a head this idea?
Initially it was my idea, the further we all придумывали together with our художником Гонзой Аугустой.
Apart from that, we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to, together with the public think of the state of the world we once передадим our children.
On the occasion of the end of May calendar we have created a unique collection of goods from shoes, t-shirts, and the original сумок ключиков against the end of the world, these things can buy. at www. E-tap. cz and thereby together to support us.
A group of the Tap Tap, together with other musicians also исполнила anthem against the end of the world, which is called “the end of the world отменяется.”
Be already полюбившийся audience YouTube anthem on these бенефисных концертах?
Of course, in the end, if in the end it will all work out and not the end of the world will come.
His запоют understood at all концертах simultaneously.
Anthems while зазвучат also live czech tv.
The words to this песне wrote and played the role of Jesus in клипе Томаш Ганак, participates in the execution also Xindl X …
As you began to cooperate with them?
We also сотрудничаем with other персонами Czech cultural life, because we spend many charitable causes and Live.
Seek to actively подключать them to these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, they are interesting.
That goes for receipts from концерта against the end of the world?
The purchase of equipment for безбарьерного educational center STUDEO, already the sixth year so we work with civil association of Tap in Едлички Institute.
Teachers regularly attend school students Institute Едлички and spend with them uplifting and interesting arrangements.
The students themselves have no money to go to преподавателям, and thus we seek to give them that opportunity.
As part of the project, the construction of additional Едлички Institute in the future there will be a separate building, in which we переедем with this project.
On every концерте committed several musical groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We tried to draw up a program that заинтересует all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, controlling Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with даном барта, the Tap Tap, Марьян Банго and Иржи Сухи.
Of all the details can be seen at www. kpks. cz.
Whether you are planning to any such “ambitious actions” in the future?
In May, will be the first time stand on фестивале “Prague Spring” and here, of course, приготовим fun program with interesting гостями.
In the next year, we would be delighted to have representation in the national чешском House in New York, and I personally, we will be in the US, is very much wanted to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About заграницы you have serious plans, you already have in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
A group of the Tap Tap-this is the group of people with limited capabilities.
As you справляетесь with expensive in terms of organization and logistics??
This is not so scared, as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in the electric инвалидных колясках, their коляски must travel in багажном secession, plus the large number of cargo and'with instruments.
However, as long as these problems without s. czech airlines ČSA and british airline British Airways has always been famously prepared for us, how many times I удивляло.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without problems.
Thanks to выездам overseas you can compare the different countries in terms of availability, public relations for the disabled, and so on.
With than you encountered by now?
After Luxembourg, Madrid, London and other countries, where everything works better than we have in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still on a basic level.
Compared with прагой in Moscow are many barriers, and there still is in диковинку самостоятельное travel on electric a wheelchair in the center of the city.
There is also not in the course of such banal things like give way to инвалиду clear.
Fortunately, and there are already there are organizations that are trying to take people's attention to the problems of people with limited capabilities.
Rather than in, on the contrary, we constantly need to catch up to the advanced countries?
There are so many things, the implementation of which far behind.
But it is important to come, that the upgrading and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those people, who is concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal that people with a severe form of disability by moving on the streets, can go to the toilet, in the museum, where everything …
There is not a very common that a large number of people with limited opportunities to take an active role in public life, in this we them with the Tap Tap slightly опережаем!
Respect for the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but in the moment, when among us will appear well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really begin to change.
As long as this single cases — people with a strong will.
A group of the Tap Tap in now is very popular, but back on two years ago, in 1998, you have forced her to organize?
I entered the Institute Едлички as воспитатель around me was a lot of young people who wanted to somehow address.
And because I've музыкант and играю including at саксофоне, along with a colleague, organized an interesting Music кружок.
Ah, but over time, says our leading Ладя Ангелович, this is a little bit out of control (смеется).
The popularity of same came only in recent years, or I something путаю?
It is true, we helped that we began to join the famous певцам and actively working on the propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can assess, essentially as if there is no.
Thanks to the European Union means we can afford skilled teachers, equipment, and so on.
Whether you stood in front of the goal so well раскрутить The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In business, a lot of things-Shaw, подражающей one another.
This is logical, all new accepted with caution, and it lasts for long.
There are very few rare things, but I say that осмелюсь Tap Tap, one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, sorry, this is of course …
But this very sorry излишня, because people with limited capabilities are not any dementia and all abandoned by individuals, which we should pity.
They are the people who can live a life and, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities-as it is, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole of society.
Обеспечило whether success that you strict head, what you think?
If we want to do work qualitatively, we should be in many things of hard-line and keep a certain discipline.
But I believe that this is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion and fly to make, and when learning that two times a week they should run on репетиции, visit подготовительные rates and spend a lot of time on the road, the very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the composition of the group the Tap Tap twenty people.
How many of them were in the early in 1998?
Only one Ладя Ангелович.
We open a group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have a desire and force of will, our door is always open.
He will be held the day before the expected end of the world, in Thursday's 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague in the stadium Incheba, in Брно - in-club and Fléda Остраве - in the center of Plynojem involving 12-60 groups and other musicians the Czech Republic.
In completing концерта all three cities combine телемостом in time for the group's song Tap Tap отменяется “the end of the world.”
The goal of this project is to collect funds in the $25 million крон on procurement многофункционального безбарьерного equipment for the educational center with STUDEO Едлички Institute in Prague.
On the concert ticket worth 400 крон, for children up to 12 years, entry free tickets can be bought in advance in. Bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week, a meeting of ministers of the european space agency Poland was adopted the twentieth member of the european space agency as the second country from countries in the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full-fledged member of ЕКА 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ЕКА in 1994, and for the next 40 years, took an active role in a series of projects to agencies.
But the path to космосу Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, the polish enthusiasts were рейсами in space, but this is not always встречалось with understanding.
Напомню, for example, about the lecture and. Штернфельда, 6 December 1933 represented in Варшавской астрономической обсерватории ideas from his innovative work in “the introduction of космонавтику.”
The idea of a young engineer (1905, R.) left the audience lukewarm, after several years of Штернфельд recalled that only Dr Ian Гадомский was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France Штернфельд won the prize of Robert Эсно - Пельтри and André Luis Хирша for “bringing космонавтику.”
Dr Ian Гадомский (1899-1966), about which stated above, later became a great пропагандистом астрономии and космонавтики.
He published in Polish, magazines, hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on this scientific disciplines.
Гадомский became known world пропагандистом космонавтики, and his contribution was the coverage including the one on the opposite side of the moon кратеров was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built rail дрезина, missile-equipped vehicle.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear, even to break or to drag carts, was to be used rocket.
Information about this дрезине known only from the press that era.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began thinking about missile стрелах.
The study logistics секция weapons technology in conjunction with professors Мечиславом Вольфке and Густавом Мокжицким.
From the lingering materials, studies have reached that stage of the practical test.
But with the arrival of german troops work were interrupted.
In 1937 in специализированной press came the idea of фотоэлектрической missiles-fighter, which proposed the engineer Рогозинский, and in the next year to work out the “air missile торпеда авиационная rocket-and-bomb” author Леливы - Кживоблоцкого.
Both projects were developed for military use rocket engines.
Before the war, all the projects military use missile technology in a temporary research and advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of work ended because of the start of the war.
The next scientific work, devoted to space achievements, appeared in the polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the polish society астронавтики (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, about the society is mentioned in November 1954 Andrews magazine “problem”, in which four публикуются wordy article on астронавтике.
In one of them, a professor of M. Суботович has proposed a society that will engage космонавтикой.
At the time, already набирали momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that the space research - перспективная industry.
Since the start of the 1956 polish society астронавтики (ПОА) tried to join the international federation астронавтики (founded in 1951), and is already in the autumn ПОА became its actual member.
And in the next year, the first chairman of the ПОА Казимеж Заранкевич (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of астронавтики.
In this post he remained until the time of his death, which came in 1959.
With the 1956 ПОА contributed a significant contribution in the development of a highly successful метеорологической missiles RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polish missile выполнившей scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 has been completed in 1957, and the launch of the first took place 10 October 1958.
Rocket, to overcome the distance 1800 M, was about 80 centimeters in length, and her weight was less than 5 kilograms.
Subsequently, was built and improved version of the RM-1А, and in the summer of 1959 on Бледовском пустыре were conducted tests двухступенчатой missiles RM-2.
The rocket was in length of about 1.4 M, and her weight was approximately 11,5 kg.
The next version of the missiles was already in a position to do the real work of rocket science-RM-34 could overcome on line, and its task was watching the high-rise ветром.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The first type of missiles Наследницей RM has become a rocket метеор - 1, which was devised in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.
Rocket was meant as двухступенчатая, its overall длина was 510 centimeters, and the initial weight-32,5 kg.
Were developed three types of (обозначенные as метеор - 1А, 1В - and-1С), the size of which различались chambers for scientific equipment.
Rocket метеор - 1А were appropriated space worth 0.4 L, метеор - 1В 0,34 L-and - метеор 1С - 0,62л.
The maximum range from all three types of was 37 kilometers.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, Aircraft Building Corporation in the development of missiles from метеор - 2, and its first летные tests began in October 1970.
Rocket метеор - 2 with стартовым 380 kg weight was able to withdraw a useful cargo weight of 10 kg on dropped about 60 kilometers.
Then were built versions of метеор 2Н метеор - and-3.
Should also mention membership in КОСПАР (Committee on Space) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee КОСПАР two years later.
In addition, within the framework of Интеркосмос, Poland joined in the research of outer space on soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the polish pilot Mirek Гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir Ремека.

The repeal of the law on public work is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled a law about public work.
The resolution has caused оживленную debate in society.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at this проблематику with a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.
It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, unconstrained by the private capital, together with unrestrained financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of the labor force (wage) raises the price tension.
Under this concept should be aware of when a producer, through the delivery of cheap goods to withstand the economic competition that “bashing” the value of a rival to take a larger share of the market, and thus increase their own income.
In the massive scale of this means for most entrepreneurs or extending the production overseas, or cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance of rises in unemployment as a result of those in countries where the cost of labor, compared with other high.
Because private capital does not bear no social responsibility, including that produced them and for unemployment, rising unavoidable state spending on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of similar businesses pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social damage caused in their pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that you do not need to make a concrete statistics.
Бесцеремонные methods of private capital to create the economies of individual states, when governments are forced to join in competition with each other, to artificially reduce social level of its population in the country, with the aim of attracting foreign capital.
In other words, the government's own population is at the discretion of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected, above all in the changes of the current legislation.
The goal is to make its economically ​​народ diktat of private capital, above all in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and, at the same time, serves as a tool for cutting workers' rights in the area of labor law.
As a result of the increasing levels of poverty and, along with that, and the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany for several years, there is the public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves own.
The number of these people are already close to a million.
In terms of the competitiveness of the german economy is constantly presented cases, when employed people receive a salary, that the state they should доплачивать, they received a living wage.
This scandal has become known to the public, and, in the case of additional workers needed.
Economic measures in nearly all of the southern states of the EU, will result in the same state, in which people, who are under pressure from the crash of social status, or forced to value, as it was in the 19th century flushed, or exist in нищенскую salary at society's backyard in the hope that someday in the country come to private investment capital.
But спрашивается, where does it take?
If the funds will come from other EU countries, the poverty move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the chinese, indian, Brazilian, Turks, марокканец, egyptian, African still works for a share of european wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media to nauseam argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of their own agriculture-driven economy that leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not the managers of the action to intervene in the economy.
Then, should answer the question, not in the private capital is now virtually the entire policy, and the governor of the state, in its own selfish purposes?
Explicit answer is yes.
It is the existence of the almost all-powerful lobbies and omnipresent in all states.
As a result, we have a situation, безысходную проявляющуюся in corruption, ensure mutual benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the State Department because of a lack of financial means поручают drafting legislation to private legal firms, which are tied to the industry.
Then these bills argues the Bundestag.
The entire power comes not from the people, as the constitution of western-style, and from the powerful groups, to their own interests.
It is clear that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly in such ​​ситуации, as it is described by Аппианом произведении in “crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar's and Помпея”: “the state has long held together, and did not engage in violence.
Bribes, illegal obtaining милостей with stones and by.
Graft and corruption flourished without the bans, and went on to a pre-election люд проданным voice”” … порядочные people not баллотировались as ruler, at the end of the day the state for eight months left without the Consul.”... “seriously began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the need for choice energetic human “.. Аппиан thought that this would be Помпей, but they became цезарь, who has replaced the democracy on an autocracy.
As in древности, in modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard to the public interest.
Private capital is inherently not intended for use in public purposes.
The current outcome is no different from the past: unparalleled decline elite without any efforts to reform the deeper character.
It means to cause of fascist and communist regimes, we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization systems, 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes, and the existence of a liberal democracy can be seen as a certain type of pausing, after which is expected to be the next round.
Above all, tragically, the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disaster that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.
The repeal of the law on public work is not a solution, or at least, not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both on the international and national and european levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social population level.
So the trend is systemic in nature.
The solution is a specific political and social reforms that will strengthen долевое state participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and private capital will weaken a monopoly position in society in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory chaos.
“Nothing will come out of the violence, and can never get out” - Стинг песня, “fragile”, where the main стихом рефрена are the words: “do not forget what we are fragile.”
“If my sons did not want war, they would not have been” - умирающая Гутель Шнапер, wife Меера Амшела Ротшильда.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has raised a number of responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position that it has a right to self-defense, and the Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism by the israeli state, genocide, over palestinian arabs, and the state of Israel attributed to the role of terrorist states.
I do not want to speculate about who in these repeated periodically волнах murder-the perpetrator and victim, who, after all, today's israeli citizens, including самоуправляемые territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and not be witnessing the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers peek behind the curtain, look at it, who above all serve of already 95 years of tension (counting from signing the Declaration Бальфура in November 1917) on a small site lands of the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning подкреплены historical facts, some of them are decommissioned, on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great and Napoleon.
What is not so clear is always whether these people are taking their own steps, or for their throne was someone who was directing their actions in advance its goals.
It should be allowed, that we live in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of power and money проистекающей of them could not happen for the life of one generation.
Among all feasible targets; rich households stands one, which could be seen as head спрута (do not know whether someone over them, but that does not rule out) - Rothschilds.
Many of them do not write.
Of course.
The news agency Reuters University) (they have already bought in the 1990s, the 19th century, to stop the rumors linking them with the name of criminal acts in the top areas in the shadow of where they are, and who has always fought to consolidate their power, приумножению wealth or both, and to another.
They are large equity holdings in nearly all the central banks in the world, and against countries, whose central banks, they do not have their share, or they are preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was 5 countries, after the ouster of Qaddafi's was only four, but at the same time, the russian government took the central bank of his country in their hands).
Anyone who has tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for Ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the Civil War, he began to issue their own (понимай - government) money and was assassinated in 1865, in the theatre.
John F. Kennedy began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. deputy Luis Макфадден'in 1936 after wanted in the FED for the launch of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for global power in the period since 1859, year on year 1871 led to develop a plan for the three world wars, created by the great масоном 33-level Al Пайком.
The first task was the destruction of the war's monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and a third should lead to a reduction in the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (the number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury goods, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (экуменизм there can be nothing, except as a prerequisite for this project) and a final grab absolute power.
A method by which works, the group of the richest households led by Ротшильдами, is a challenge to the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao-order out of chaos.)
But these decisions are always фальшивыми and lead to a worsening of the situation (see the FED basis, which would prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).
So, after they managed to unleash the first world war by killing габсбургского heir of the Austro-hungarian See Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, launching a Bolshevik революциию.
The first world war ended in a sudden, unaccountable воинском and about the surrender of Germany (already had no need for the war to destroy the Tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, happened раздробление central european powers, Austria-Hungary.
To relieve the outbreak of World War II, bankers and politicians have created a stealthy конфликтную situation, imposing on Germany's vast war reparations, than a prerequisite to radicalization of impoverished masses, then remained only подкинуть Germans strong enough обличающего guilty and offering simple solutions Leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong german minority, which was supposed to play, and indeed played a function fifth columns, sparking the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds, producing a reason Zionist movement, one of which sought to create a jewish state, preferably in the area of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (the return in Сион).
Вышеупомянутая declaration Бальфура created a prerequisite for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, came the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
Flared the second world war, it is difficult to gauge whether Hitler, pulled out of the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or all that he has done, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of european jews in concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the jewish state, the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and, just as Germany was because of military репарациями 2-Yu's global war, the state of Israel was провозглашено, to create a third очаг war.
If international bankers can unleash its, jewish people, and during the second World War, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now, together with the arab or, simply put, muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only at home, but also on the international level (take only a sharp division of people on supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is a victim of the Israeli-palestinian conflict, where the offensive breeds обиду in endless chain of violence, if all began with the greed of the individuals and their commitment to a global power?
There needs to be distinguished from the ordinary people of Israel's leaders, because, as we, the international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections exclusively their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, a hawk is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician, doing everything in order to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan …), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over Ормузским содержащим Strait, 20% of all the world's oil reserves (судоходный corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what is now more words, David Рокфеллером in 1994: “all we need is a crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
A new world order in their view of the world is similar and slaves.
The rest of the world, where human populations serves a handful of financial aristocracy, наслаждающейся комфортом.
A world where everyone born body at birth имплантируют чип, with whom he becomes a creature under total control.
“And makes all the small and big, rich and destitute, free and slave have on right-hand or on лбу stigma, so that people who are not помечен name the strange, or the number of his name, nor could not buy or sell.
This wisdom: everyone who has a mind that can calculate the number of strange.
For it is consistent with the name of human, and this number шестьсот sixty-six.

The film “Operation Арго”: when the worse nowhere, вызывайте Hollywood
In November 1979, the crowd of islamist student demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Резы Пехлеви бежавшего, after the revolution in the US, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration a positive outcome of the situation not to, she could not afford to dismiss Shah overboard because that is at the root of the allies could undermine confidence in other countries.
But to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not able to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was reinforced by the botched the release of the hostages by force.
Inmates diplomats were finally released after 444 days after talks brokered by the government of Algeria.
Their fate has triggered a wave of solidarity at home and антииранских sentiment.
The defeat in Iran has largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election-year, completed the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, срежессированный актером Ben Аффлеком “Operation Арго” describes one of the episodes in the history of America, which brought a small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of six embassy workers managed to escape.
After they completed the complex further twists its way in the embassies of Canada.
The CIA, in collaboration with the canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, it has helped экстравагантная legend dressing, according to which they выехали on canadian passports as members of the production team in place for the country, подыскивавшие съемок - fantastic epic.
The combination of жанров
The plan, which invented the expert “evacuation” Tony Мендес, asking for cooperation in Hollywood.
To legend was accurate, in specialized journals have been about the film, устраивались press conference, the fictional manufacturing company, had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Мендеса.
The film Аффлека - this particular combination of several жанров.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called “film - киноопус”, the history of successful затеи, bubble-example may be a series of films about friends Оушена.
The film constantly change the mood-on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes from Tehran (титрах shown знаковые historical photos, events and the way that those same situation were продемонстрированы in film — big differences in this not).
On the other hand, Hollywood облегченные fragments, пересекающиеся with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions-the men in suits, discussing the situation for tables, negotiations on лестницах institutions, on the phone …
Бену Аффлеку gloriously failed to make рестарт careers.
From высмеянного actor became a respected режиссером, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
“Operation Арго” his third полнометражный film, after the tragic детектива “say good-bye to, детка, say good-bye to” (2007) and “триллера city” (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film Аффлека, who remains in his hometown of the filmmaker-Boston.
A sense of the atmosphere in the room this refers to the taste, which возвышали earlier films director over голливудским standard.
And it shows in the “Аффлек Арго”, where Tehran “plays” in Canada.
The best scenes in the film are occurring on the streets, with the reconstruction of real events — the entrance scenes of the embassies of his impressive clarity, which also captures the confusion and непредвиденности emotions that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.
Similar effect Аффлек and his colleagues are in сценах s fictional (fake headquarters in Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
Режиссеру had to deal with that narrative suggests many exciting scenes кинематографического meaning.
He is successfully working with this little, sometimes something додумывает - there all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a telephone call in America, prevents the impending crisis in Tehran's airport, and the chase on runways посадочной page look quite надуманно).
The lack of “Арго” is absent, associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Аркин and John Гудман in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very обаятельны, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are in the film is far from the only.
The film Аффлека lacks a little драматизма, this film, which can be viewed with moderate interest, assessing постановку and retro-style, воссоздающий триллеры 1970.
But exciting.
However, that is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, and also for evidence, as exaggerated notions of the all-powerful and всезнающих спецслужбах.

The rules of fueling air шаров, bananas and circus
Portal www. bankovnipoplatky. com, each year, a survey of the most ridiculous bank сборах, now has decided to declare the competition on “the most absurd ruling or project from the workshop of the EU”.
“We сподвигло to this recent event, in which the EU's plans to take 40% quota for women in the administration of the large european companies,” said “law” leading опросника Patrick Нагер.
Among the already urged by the номинацию абсурдностей - the recent decision of the European Court for unification rates insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had the benefits of life insurance for insurance companies, because they are objectively less prone to risk.
“Further steep ideas from the workshop of the EU, people can file on competition before the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” said Нагер.
The controversial EU should include, for example, and compulsory adding биокомпонентов in fuel, as a result of the harmful nature, and a ban on the use of reliable ртутных градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or the directive about the size of cages for hens, owing to what this year's significantly tightened their eggs.
Also criticized was the de facto ban on the use of the term “бутербродное oil” or withdrawal from the sale of the classic лампочек.
The qualitative bananas must be 2,000-14 centimeters.
European-wide apparatus often gets the decision under the pressure of the trade or industrial lobbies, the position in which Brussels usually defended any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat вета asserts the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby to be: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union were to achieve длины in 14 See and not to be “смели аномальную кривизну.”
While the European Commission оправдывалась that only the loosest harmonize national rules that are complicating the trade.
The EU, despite the opposition of some states, yet has softened standards concerning the fruits and vegetables, referring to the existing directives will lead to расточению products.
Кандидатом on the gains in poll can be, and last year's ruling, the EU, according to which продающиеся air шарики must necessarily снабжаться warning that children younger than eight years can't inflate their weapons without adults.
The EU has reached out to american studies, in accordance with which air шарики in the game are a potential cause of death of children through that is being strangled.
Such a limit is now spreading to children up to 14 years, which is banned in дуть ярмарочные дуделки.
Забавные ideas born and at home
Enough is absurd and rule regarding the european officials: everyone who is in the EU any official position, could not, given the sensitivity of themes for Greece, the use of the name Macedonia, and should instead say “FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bankovnípoplatky. com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists, the principle of “non-interference” (Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, apart from a few more of these ridiculous rules, for example, usually about the size of the EU's food supplies to the territory членского state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food supplies, which may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its membership in the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic has topped, for example, set volumes консервированных грибов, for that it faced a large fine.
The organizers also опросника заинтересовала and the idea of some countries to pay for something that they don't have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the statement about receiving subsidies.
But these ideas have emerged in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.
Попросим European Union about compensation,” declared in the autumn of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslaw палас (ЧСДП).
As he pointed out, that the country was a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called pre-emption интервенционных state was full of depots, which was necessary вывезти.
For that, the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to паласу, should have to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission has gone to the Czech Republic, ordering the tender on buying grain from countries that do not have the landlocked.
Subsidies to obtain subsidies offered селам ministry of regional development, the german minister руководимое Pavel (us-DEU), in particular, such subsidies would go to the statements on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: fancy orders are the exception
Although the resolution in the member states can easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU's regulation, as well as on more efficient functioning and development of the EU, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, experts say, is the EU's черпание grants for projects that do not have even a hint of something shared with the deepening european integration, but which the member states have made in discussing the budget.
Is the emotions among the czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to identify specific their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this contest.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and retained by the Austrians наименование “Оломоуцкие сырки”, but “Туземский ром” tradition, which in our country are rooted in the 19th century, our producers must have been переименовать on “Туземак.”
Called ромом can only products from тростникового дистиллята, not from sugar beets.
The official list of registered products to the EU, along with the internationally known сырами “фета” and “горгондзола” марципаном from german Любека or пармской ham, has already proved, for example, карловарские сухари, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий хмель.
Commodities also sign the EU can be proud of пардубицкий carrots and горжицкие трубочки.

People want to I оберегал republic, but I любитель, argues Окамура.
Mr. senator, as a man's head is going to run for president?
I don't think about becoming a senator or president.
If we had in the country all function without problems, I would not undermine ran.
But I already can't look, as in the last 20 years the country разворовывается, quick суетятся воры, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I have no ambitions to be a politician.
But when they see something that I don't like it, then try to find a solution, as this change.
And because I have already turned forty years and I an independent person, not относящийся nor to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.
In the Senate, you were, but soon set in presidential castle.
Not поворачиваетесь you thus back to the people that you have chosen?
I say all the time that включусь in a fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.
Later I уточнил, if that will be elected senator, will run for president.
My goal is not the position, a position-it is a tool through which I can make their views.
So I need the most influence and широчайшие powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation ропщем themselves in a bar or watching tv, but with this ready растоптать any who try something has to change.
To this добавляются media that human очерняют, and which confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, about me saying that I даю bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to the Иржи Пароубека.
Turn to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with the thesis of the material and the criminal responsibility of politicians and about обратных property of the above $20 million.
In order to do this, we need to change the law.
You have no such powers as president, and only a Senate may propose laws.
As you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen of the lobbying to holding экскурсий became free enterprise, it failed to advance.
The problem is in политиканстве - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately чинят obstacles, and that is holding back the citizens.
As an independent беспартийного person I am far greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
I have an advantage in that I without party раскладывания on полочкам, irrespective of the tenets can take from each party, what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you see a person, more relevant to the right or to the left?
With the Czech's point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to blame me for the left.
For me, not at all important-a little to the left or the right.
For me, it is important that we were going forward.
It is not about what someone refers to the right, and to the left, I want to unite people.
I always assistance of any good for society, whether his decision to propose КПЧМ or гдп, and I just go against bad ideas.
You злитесь, when someone says that you are a populist.
But not доказываете you this is what you said?
When you создаете business plan for firms, you also have some ideal goal and views.
And for this you стараетесь converge.
We can call this populism, but all the proposals, to which I say, already operate in the world, or the prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans.
And with that, in politics, you cannot long продержитесь.
Or do you think that when you выйдете to people and поговорите with them, you will realize the material and criminally responsible?
I have no other opportunities.
Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and to try to lure away them on their side, that we have made.
If I was elected president, it would establish the direct tv ways in which I draw on председателям parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminally responsible for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of failure, should be told why it does not want.
If there is a strong personality, which makes the abuses, it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president – that was the achievement of public pressure.
To say directly that I любитель, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies, to stand up for their beliefs and views.
I only amateur in politics, and for his program попытаюсь gain the support of the majority.
Things I try to push their own; in that case, if this fails, through six years закончу and go back to the private sector.
This is, in part, it sounds as if Окамура should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not no savior.
I know that, one, I will do nothing, so I ignored a number of famous people with offering a run for the Senate.
I went to Радиму Янчуре, he refused, in connection with a lot of work.
Also I at least supported leading investigations журналистку Jan Лоренцову, which exposed the fraud with light fuel Asia.
I put forward his candidacy because people and really неудовлетворены, but now I feel themselves on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people are not going to vote, and the majority of those who have opted for the representatives of the establishment.
Us independents in the Senate, only two.
People chose the Senate so that the changes will be implemented.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of his own party?
I have not thought about this, because I have no time to screen the purity of the past every potential supporter, and I have no money to do so.
There is no money and in the presidential campaign, on my transparent run only twenty thousand крон.
You have no money?
You talk about the property, and how are your own affairs with this?
Personal wealth is estimated at $60 million.
I have a station in Prague, at a cost of around $25 million, headquartered in 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, коллекция art of approximately 10 million, Астон - Martin at 3.5 million and шкода Суперб per million, well, and even a few million on account.
Incidentally Астон - Martin I have emerged, because this was my мальчишечья dream-I always liked Джэймс Bond, who traveled by car, was галантен with women, and at the same time fought against over villainy and lawlessness.
You ездите on Астон - мартине, own property on 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but their own money in this particularly don't want to invest.
This is not very convincing.
I have no 15-60 million on the campaign.
I must inject themselves in debt?
In the campaign, I have already invested $2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program not so интересна.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
Spending on the campaign, I essentially покроет сенаторская salary.
But on this money, I would have not had lived, for example, could not pay for the son of a british school, which is 30 thousand a month.
If I just wanted to earn money, so nowhere would not ran.
Thus, you will continue to do business, to live?
Wouldn't you not saying that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of salaries.
As I promised, and their activities I partly reduced.
For example, the Managing Director of tourist agencies in the spring will be my deputy.
People would have wanted to, that I was бессребренником, which will keep the Republic.
But I also need to something live.
How much, how the entrepreneur, you are accustomed to getting a month?
From two to четырехсот thousands that получаю and beyond.

The architects of the MVRDV argue that the real adventure is not only in the imagination of Спейкениссе and his recently built the book mountains-2 photos
“It seems to me the building веселым, it looks футуристично, finally we have once again we can see something interesting,” says Лизетте Верхайг прохожая, on the edge of the road.
But Stephane Спермон, a specialist on it based on nearby major venture, believes so: “no, this building is really good.”
But I wonder: why do we now another library?
Everyone has the Internet, ipads and electronic books.
Now, no one has already voluntarily not enter such old-fashioned library, right?
Спейкениссе, малопримечательному спальному городку under роттердамом, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population numbers 80.000 people has a very low level of education in the Netherlands.
To deal with this always: a few years ago, it was decided to make a contribution to the overall education and build seven s fictional bridges, who portrayed on the euro notes, in the form of живописно раскрашенных миниатюр from железобетона.
The success of this initiative просветительской was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that it was the only way to break the grip of statistics: build here библиотеку!
Вини Маас from роттердамского архитектурного bureau MVRDV, Master of the courageous столбчатых диаграмм and author of clever, sometimes even cynical построек, snubbed by the task with his usual невозмутимостью and appeared on конкурсном opposition research in 2003 with five books under мышкой and ухмылкой on its face.
And so, as the members of the judges озадаченно оглядывались and shrugged, дерзкий Маас сложил from its original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in his project of the following words: “respected townspeople!”
This is it, my proposal: “книжная Gore” in Спейкениссе, the so-called Букенберг!
After nine years of this mountain of 30 million euros.
It is part of the project, which also includes ревитализации underground гараж, supermarket, mail and several surrounding them home prices and таунхаусов a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, “книжная Gore” was marked by a second Prize competition “the best library in the Netherlands of 2012 .”
The project also participates in the dutch national конкурсе wooden equipment 2012.
Thus, безликий пригород, which previously could not offer nothing but the post-modern pedestrian zone and surprisingly некрасивой ратуши, white facades which suggest a молокозаводе, has become richer, the one thing the modern architecture.
But most important of all-in Спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The long road to book
First impressions: книжное Эльдорадо under колпаком for lunch.
There was only one, in the center of the лифт проходящий горного array, for the real aficionados of the architecture and reading choose to explore the countryside пешком.
Остекленное from all sides-removal светлое and easily foreseeable, floors of обожженного Hinduism asserts and many street lights unmistakably creates a sense of public urban area.
The urban environment воссоздана perfectly.
View unwittingly seek скамейки, dogs and are in the football boys and девчонок.
And everywhere-books, books, books.
“Usually the deficit shelf are along the facades, and are located in the middle of a dark hall, typically неуютный and безликий,” says вини Маас.
We have put a classic sense of space on its head and lift the zone for reading from the inside out.
Domestic space of the book mountains used skillfully: in the center of the host offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental and technical center locations.
Especially радуют black deficit shelf, which serve the отделкой walls, парапетами, лестничными перилами.
Their sights and smells текстура peculiar.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers, construction workers lost in more than guesswork, what it is for unknown material.
“We tried to work with the secondary materials,” explains Йоп Трауборст, head of the project, representing the community of Спейкениссе, in line with the demands of a standard.
And once again on the same agrarian venture in Фрисландии we met a by-product of agriculture.
For many years in теплицах and on the fields in the Netherlands as подкладки under roots applied artificial волокнистый material миллиметровой толщины.
It is cheap and saves time.
A delicate textiles, serves a one-two of the season, after that it can emit.
For the first time in this library полотно - such volumes-was спрессовано in панели толщиной four сантиметра.
Under the impact of the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (KLP) into the dark, homogenous, the sound of the material, a bit like a new car and запаху little sneakers.
At the top are 105 ступеней.
The one who преодолеет path-almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in литературном cafes not only fantastic species in the city, but also the dutch крокетами and древесными фикусами in window.
They care about the atmosphere, and in the first part of the right humidity air on literary woe.
The costs for a new soul
“It's hard to believe, but this is a building, despite many стеклянных structures, represents образцовый project in terms of ecology,” says Троуборст.
For his отопления and cooling the Earth is used.
Although книжная Gore is under glass колпаком, even in the clear days the sun falls into the only briefly.
Vast farms of клееной timber, lying перпендикулярно стеклянному фасаду, provide shade and take on more of the solar rays.
The climate in помещении very palatable.
The rest of the defense provides a fully automatic рулонные шторы.
Stephane Спермон, упоминавшийся above скептик from it, has already visited the new библиотеку.
Лизетте Верхайг also was already here.
As well as the traditional chinese medicine преподавательница Синтия Богард, which is called “the soul of Букенберг Спейкениссе, which has long lacked.”
The reason: a few weeks before the opening of every citizen has received an invitation to sacrifice one of their own book.
These books were to occupy the empty seats on the shelves are not yet fully укомплектованной library-at the time it was 70.000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelf заставлены доверху.
“There is nothing worse than полупустая library,” says the architect вини Маас.
“I think that, thanks to our invitation now every citizen in some ways is associated with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the buildings.
Even if it only serves to.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Спейкениссе wrote his литературную history.
And even though they are very young and необразованны.
This is, after all, only the initial point for english identity.

Сабо: “the Germans should play a more important role”
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Сабо, an expert on the relationship between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow the diplomatic path.
Most Welle: in the early weeks, Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of the Palestinians to get observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin refrained voting.
Why?
Стефен Сабо: Germany does not support israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany needs to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the american position, it also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence – while not speaking too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the imposition of no-fly zones.
In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is true.
The fact is that it is in the process of converting its foreign policy, and it is moving from the policy, which is to say, by the US, to strictly german foreign policy.
The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans lack a coherent single policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed to this.
I believe that, as long as they only нащупывают its role, but are on the road to a more “normal” foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which holds France or Britain.
What exactly is the “normal” foreign policy from the german point of view?
This willingness to borrow in its national interest, is not dependent on the US or european partners.
I believe that the german foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and links with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany largely differ from those of other big states, and so Germany must defend their interests.
The tables are the economic interests of the position in the Middle East conflict, and for a vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Gulf states.
So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and elite in arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not attached to the far too much weight, it is not entirely one-sided link.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, воздерживаясь when important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am confident that, in Europe and even in the United States, the majority of the german position.
So I do not think that this was the same dramatic надлом, as the libyan issue.
Germany may even become so a certain respect.
After all, this is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that with its interests entails reckoned.
In Europe there are different opinions about the palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, clearly have voiced support for the veto.
There is a divergence of opinion between the US and many european states?
In the power of american domestic politics, such differences have always existed.
I believe that Obama's government in the back of their minds has sufficient understanding of the european position.
But in connection with the local political situation the government, of course, can't openly hold such a position.
I believe that a significant divergence of opinion is not so significant, as always, it seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, the reply that Obama is not enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
It is easy to whether Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes it such a difficult situation for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, непротиворечивая european policy, but now it is not.
So they can't stand as part of a broader approach and instead are forced to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
It is because they are doing to the euro.
I think that, in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in forging a common european position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, because of ties with Israel.
This theme has always been щекотливой.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player-not to take it on a really major role?
Or the leadership role is still hard to give Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to this, it still always a disappointment and, for obvious reasons, so far always comes, it is hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – each time, when Germany assume the important role that lends itself to the various антигерманские feelings.
The Germans are not just deal with it.
Indeed, it is an old problem: you do not want to be is surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more precarious position than that of the US.
It must take into account the different neighbors and opinion, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in european politics has diminished, but at the moment the EU is not supplied this vacuum, who remains the same, then?
The Germans simply have to play a more significant role.
Even if you do not like it, not pleasant or reinforces нелюбовь to you-this is life!
Стефен Сабо - deputy director Трансатлантической Academy in Washington, the Institute, in which the obscure academics and experts, political scientists from Europe and North America jointly researching the transatlantic community.
In addition, a member of the German Marshall Fund Сабо - in which he specializes in german politics, us foreign policy and transatlantic relations.

“Preserving commodity signs” in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become chinese
Armani is universally known Trade Mark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But that such Armani Polo?
It is officially зарегистрированное наименование in China, which has nothing to do with the names of firms, from which it образовано.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of benchmark names not предъявят lawsuit.
But then, and it is unclear whether they stand up for their rights.
“Foreigners is becoming increasingly difficult to defend their commodity signs in China,” says Thomas Паттлох, Taylor Wessing, a company lawyer специализирующийся on rights violations on commodity signs in the Far East.
On my desktop every week appearing on a new case of this kind.
Имитаторам enough to add just a couple of letters, to gain the right to file their trade signs.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead Wears Prada can file-Kny.
This same way legally they are copied german enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma.
Паттлох папку opens with записями departments registration commodity signs in Beijing.
14 September 2010 chinese company recorded there, the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which also used the name fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
What the Chinese are champions of the world by копированию and violation of intellectual property rights, are known.
In big cities, there are многоэтажные универмаги продающие almost exclusively a forgery.
But things are not such Паттлоха. on behalf of its доверителей he opposes to chinese enterprises is officially withdrew from the ministry official registration of commodity signs right to use the name, which is guarded by somewhere else.
The chinese call it “бан минпай,” Mark - пассажир.
It is associated with the word “бан дакуань.”
So-called women who preyed upon for rich men.
The chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
“This damages the business, with the need to fight,” convinced Паттлох.
“Trade Mark размывается, unique position flotations, image very much suffering.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in affected areas in the millions, especially in the case of the expensive копируемых products.
According to market research company CLSA China, with volume sales of 15 billion euros in the year, is the third largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
But achieving undoing of dubious records in реестре trade execution is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Паттлох recounts affairs, in which the court rejected claims, as the first long опротестованное name became “реалией market.”
If not истцу is lucky, he will have to pay even плагиатору, as his знаку damaged the trade in China, says Паттлох.
Sometimes, the law of the jungle rules here.
There is also the famous case of графических elements.
In 2009 the company Daimler lost the legal dispute with the producer of construction machines, Sany, a business that, shortly before the firm acquired-producer бетононасосов Putzmeister.
So the Chinese still have the right to use эмблему, similar to the Mercedes, star.
Купившая Volvo company Geely originally used сине - white логотип, напоминавший BMWS; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
A producer of fancy goods Lacoste lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, which has the famous крокодил looked the other way.
The chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
Agency records of commodity signs CTMO in Beijing confirms that in 2010, because of a lack of personnel and equipment and there have been setbacks.
But in the past year has “return from emergency workers in the process to normalcy.”
So, the number of cases has dropped objections необработанных at 22 percent.
It was closed almost 57.000 such affairs, 75% more than last year.
Yet 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in ведомстве.
To deal with this is expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year in CTMO comes more than 1.4 million claims about protecting trade execution, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China in ten consecutive time led the list of new регистраций all around the world, the agency reports.
The same goes for the total number of actual trade execution, only 5.5 million штук.
In 2011, was to pay out £1.8 billion yuan fee.
If simplify, this means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Опротестовать its worth many times more, as it shows the german family enterprises Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, owned fights against the chinese плагиатора.
The Germans have done, that the illegal production of them fake auto parts was gone.
But имитатор secured for a chinese rights on the trade mark Freudenberg.
This was an oversight of their own, so as not to be protecting Bin in Germany, says Ханно Вентцлер, Chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the agency records of trade execution CTMO rejected претензию мюнхенцев.
The truth, in both the next инстанциях Freudenberg won, but the other side continues to struggle so far.
Need to be on guard
The question now is for review in the Supreme Court.
Вентцлер hopes to bring it to a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: “the process extremely roads and take what we have plenty of time, money, and the nerve.”
Domestic spending is unlikely to succumb to the учету, архиву firms had to просмотреть even a century ago, acts to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg inconclusively proposed противной side of “greater шестизначную amount in euros” for a settlement.
“Hence, it is clear how costly that we should,” says Вентцлер.
The dangers of the Far East threatened to infect even in Europe.
And it is in that case, if имитаторы register there for a soft trading signs.
So, one chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to file наименование Freudenberg for shoes and products from the skin.
Owned long ago ceased production in these areas, but despite that failed to prevent the registration.
“The need to be vigilant,” says Вентцлер.
As he and the lawyer Паттлох recommend german businesses to be very cautious with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations protecting commodity signs, more foreigners should be “all that somehow it is worth defending, registering also in China,” says Вентцлер.
Otherwise, it may prove to be worth far more than the registration.
Indeed, if the Freudenberg lose in the last act of his drama about signs of the trade, it should pay противной side лицензионные fees for its own name, explains Вентцлер.
Otherwise, we drive away from the market in спорном сегменте.

The World AIDS Day: притоптывать, sing, help
In the chorus of Хайдельберге репетирует Имбонги - and AIDS orphans in Свазиленде rejoice.
The history of relations, преодолевших distance more 8733 kilometers.
At first can притопывание: ковбойские сапоги, баскетбольные sneakers, дамские лодочки and male тапки pick такт on паркетном semi and quickly find him.
Time-two-three-four.
Only after this slowly increase the voices of singers - альт, Lord, тенор сопрано - and they are coming, and follow each other for очаровывают.
And Фите Хопф, a 29-year-old the conductor, not just from their выскакивает матерчатых туфель when leads them flexible and выразительными gestures.
Monday night, in the room музыкальном Institute of medical psychology in Хайдельберге chorus of Имбонги репетирует new song.
Fifty members of the choir on репетицию came from 23 to 69 years, from специалистки on human genetics to дворника.
“Th” Обани” — not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to completely чуждом language: зулусском, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Aid for самопомощи
According to the assessment of Unaids, the United Nations program on AIDS in the world, there are about 34 million people infected with HIV.
23,5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Свазиленде contains 245 4,000 orphans, AIDS.
With more than 40% of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Эситжени group Voices for Africa has found шефов in Germany.
70 of them attend school, готовящую to further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, one can assume шефство.
It guarantees the child money to school, school uniforms and day-to-day hot lunch in Гого - center.
Имбонги on зулусском language means рассказчик or восхвалитель.
In this chamber does not speak fluent on банту, but are good at singing.
Almost ten years of chorus of разучивает songs on this strange soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, the length of the summer 8733 kilometers from Хайдельберга, in the northwest of the Kingdom's Swaziland, is the village Эситжени, which depends on the votes of the german choir.
Forty percent of Инфицированы
There are about 2,000 people, some still in ordinary хижинах from глины and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus ИЧ.
In Эситжени, reflected in the disease: the highest level of Swaziland is HIV infection, has the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision at flesh in men, which reduces the risk of contagion доказанно, half the population is almost taken.
More than forty percent of the population in Swaziland are themselves using, death in the mid-fourth decade-are not rare.
The chorus of opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants Имбогни saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only родительской concerns, but simply: food, clothing, education.
Without a school education a person has in a poor country, there is no chance at all.
First it was the commitment of private individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get hot food.
But a year later, the chorus of a unification “Voices for Africa”, which has since almost профессионально cares about сиротах AIDS in Эситжени.
Facts about инфекциях, sexually transmitted
What are the most important, sexually transmitted disease?
To dismiss бактериальным ИППП сифилис, хламидиоз and триппер (гонорею).
Frequent viral ИППП are HIV, the human папиллома - virus, генитальный герпес and гепатит.
Лобковый педикулез and чесотка belong to паразитарным ИППП.
What are the major поражаемые groups?
Сифилис and гонорея meet mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Institute of Robert коха comes from what the least in four out of every five cases сифилиса, registered in Germany, the transition is happening as a result of sexual contact between men.
The гетеросексуальных adults often встречающимися illnesses передающимися sexually, are хламидийные infection, трихомониаз, кандидоз (грибок), гонорея and human папиллома - virus.
The spread of HIV among гетеросексуальных adults we have relatively low, but about 20 percent of new HIV заражений falls on this group.
Youth хламидийные infection are significantly more often than among other groups.
According to the data, three-quarters of all infections hit young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have the youth also often meets human папиллома - virus.
As is changing the number of infections?
Not all of the disease, transmitted sexually, are subject to mandatory registration.
Incidence of сифилисом, according to the Institute of Robert коха, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV заражений since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is roughly one-tenth of one less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to венерическое disease?
With infectious diseases can arise canker in the area of genital mutilation, complaints with мочеиспускании, throwing, pain, bottom живота, and also the will or уплотнения.
But often they are not accompanied by болями and other symptoms and remain.
How can we protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but it does not provide стопроцентной protection.
After all, partly возбудители diseases, передающихся sexually, can also spread through контактной infection and in close physical contact.
So experts recommend regular check-ups, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis can be cured most ИППП and avoid the consequences of the remote.
Шефство, donations and not in the least fees charged for speech choir across Germany allow something up.
“All we have sent in Эситжени already roughly 200,000 euros,” says Аннете Леннартц, Chairman of unification.
In the village of money from Germany ordering Цодва Дламини, conscious and an active woman.
She cares about the orphans were well-built up, for example in one of бабушек.
Гогос, call on зулусском old women, this pillar of the villages.
Some of them have taken to him to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and making sure that, in the form of children every day in time came from.
Those who are not left home, coming in to the orphanage Ханийсиле, lonely woman, being paid from associations, as well as two поварихи that every day, prepare for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, the “Voices for Africa” organized a швейную school построило two курятника and, together with the american institution to protect public health PSI organized a surrender of analysis on HIV for many residents of the villages.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is evident across the country, prefer deep silence.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Аннете Леннартц, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Quite unusually for a country in which the King has officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Мсвати III, known for his fondness for излишествам.
Polygamy, instead of a democracy.
In particular, on such санкционированном state-style life also lays the blame for what the virus ИЧ so quickly spread in recent years.
But it is also the бродячих workers разносят virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every street corner, says Аннете Леннартц, “but they almost do not use.
Another culture-flesh to flesh.”
In order to maintain a bit of cultural exchange, the chorus of Ибмогни every two or three years, making a trip to South Africa and поет songs, full of грусти, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern corner of the black continent know even since the days of apartheid.
The bus, full of white, singing a song in the black language-such recognition not only brings a good mood and rejoicing, but, even so, engendering tears in the eyes of the strictest пограничников.
Trip always also leads in Эситжени, where певцы подшефных children attend.
Despite that, a small village with a hard-to-can be found on the map, in the River Valley Эцулвени it more than known.
“Идите in Эситжени, light,” said здешние people.
And after-8733 километрового flying time back in Хайдельберг when топающие певцы returning in репетиционный hall on the street Бергхаймер, we can see that this light on fire and also here.

Мессенджер: NASA opens the ice on Меркурии
“Зонд Мессенджер” has found evidence that the planet Меркурий there is ice.
Ice coverage can have толщину to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA proved the ice on the planet Меркурий.
Although it is located closer to the Sun, there also is замерзшая water, as явствует from three studies, published in the journal Science in Thursday's special.
“Зонд Мессенджер” found evidence that permanently based in the shadow of a region of the planet покрыт ice.
His толщина should be a minimum of 30 centimeters, and perhaps even to 20 meters.
Supposedly, the water comes with a comet or asteroid, facing Меркурием.
No one links the opening of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said chief scientific зонда Sean соломон.
Temperatures on Меркурии can achieve 426 degrees Celsius.
But these discoveries could help explain how the water and the other building blocks of life into other places in the solar system.
Aspirant for the inhabitants of the Earth зонды, telescopes and small robots, for example “феникс”, examine the depth of the universe.

In the constellation змееносца astronomers photographed by a harbinger of space-based clashes: 400 million light years from Earth's core, two сливающихся galaxies несутся towards each other and inevitably collide.
This is the birth of stars телескоп “Хаббл” removed in спиральной галактике M83.
Those who do not like the technical cuts, may call it nicknamed “southern Цевочное wheel.”
A photograph of space-based telescope “Хаббл” shows фрагмент туманности ирис in constellation Цефея.
Туманность, удаленная on 1,400 light years, is composed of particles of dust, the size of ten to a hundred times less than the usual domestic dust.
This image was составлено from optic and x-pictures of various телескопов.
It shows a ring of black holes, удаленное on 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 сфотографировал for NASA space телескоп “Хаббл.”
Most scientists call спиральную galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star туманности is the most vibrant group of new stars of our млечного path.
Звездная wine, constantly creating new stars.
This звездное cloud, with United туманностью розетка, also creates a new star-a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly светящейся галактике with small black hole is no dust, only the gas.
Researchers suggest that it emerged shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe mainly be hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: major telescopes
Probably телескоп was invented in 1608 year Хансом Липперсгеем - even before Galileo галилей a year later, proceeded to surveillance stars.
Since then, the mirror optic телескопов became ever more accessible-and their view of space all the deeper.
For 30 years, and it is from 1947 to 1975, the year телескоп “social” in обсерватории Паломар under San Diego телескопом was the biggest in the world.
The mirror, изображенное here, had диаметр five meters.
In Arizona, the US, a “big бинокулярный телескоп.”
It allows us to look in space, with the help of two mirrors, each диаметром 8.4 meters.
“Гран Телескопио Канариас” has a giant inner workings - диаметр one only mirror is 10.4 meters.
A mirror of the “great южноафриканского telescope” in South Africa сегментировано - for the sake of cut costs.
Yet in diameter, it reaches roughly eleven meters.
The lack of low-cost constructive implementation: телескоп rigidly скреплен under вертикальным corner-it limits his mobility.
“Телескоп Хобби - Эберли” in Texas also has a fixed вертикальный corner.
His feature: high светособирающая ability.
It reaches-despite the relatively small диаметр mirrors the parameters of the world's major телескопов.
With the help of радиотелескопа in Аресибо (Puerto Rico,) researchers listened to внеземным cues in space.
Радиотелескоп has диаметр 305 meters.
Participating in the project “search внеземного Reason” (SETI), any owner of a computer can help, by giving its вычислительную capacity.
On the kind of european обсерваторию астрономической Service (to) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is “a very big телескоп” - entirely appropriate to their name.
His four mirrors to cover in зрительной tube even average инфракрасный spectrum.
In Chile обсерватории also planned to setting the european “a very large telescope.”
Its main mirror should раскинуться by as much as 42-foot-and will be составлено of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But the photos should expect, not before.
Until 2007, both of the existence of “Кек” on гавайском вулкане Мауна Кеа were considered to be the largest in the world.
They established two mirrors диаметром on ten meters.
“Телескопы Кек” in обсерватории Мауна - Кеа, which along with them, staring at the sky and with the help of телескопов Субару” and “IRTTF.
Moreover, the Мауна - Кеа should emerge a new giant телескоп - with a mirror image of диаметром thirty meters.
Here, they can be полюбоваться on иллюстрации.
But the most important species from space to space телескоп “Хаббл.”
On 24 April 1990 he delivers images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space телескоп “Kepler” searches for planets outside the solar system, first and foremost, on which the possible life.
2 February 2011, NASA reported that 1235 planets — the candidates have been detected since the start of the mission.
The photos запечатлены recent preparations “Kepler space telescope.”
Space телескоп James Уэбба (JWST) will be sent into space, not previously, on board the missiles “Ариан 5 .”
The mirror инфракрасного space telescope has диаметр 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of existence: he must to the first stars and galaxies look for the big bang.
Scientists suggest that the South Pole Меркурия there is ice.
But there is no credible evidence of this, as “Мессенджер” revolves closer to northern полюсу planet.
Радарные замеры for decades, indicated that the Меркурии there is ice.
Thanks to запущенному in 2004 зонду “Мессенджер” – the first, which revolves around Меркурия scientists now believe in this.

Пейте oil every day-and живите to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people go to библейски почтенного age.
Even here there is a museum longevity.
The search for разгадки in a country where 97-year-old старцы seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people go to библейски почтенного age.
Even here there is a museum longevity.
The search for разгадки in a country where 97-year-old старцы seem still relatively young.
The journey through Талышские mountains can be called wild and романтичной.
Микроавтобус with громыханием headed on the road past извилистой заросших by dense forests, the turbulent речек and ordinary peasant houses.
All around so зелено and vividly that, one might think that is in Шварцвальде.
But it is the southern edge Azerbaijan, Iran's border is only a few kilometers from there.
Here live талыши is one of the nations of the Caucasus, about which little is known, is just what they do and say on фарси азербайжданском and different долголетием.
The final point is Лерик.
Small town кичится too heavy architecture of soviet times, which is not harmony with живописным mountain ландшафтом.
Tourists from Europe's almost not coming here, the road from the capital Baku азербайджанской утомительна too.
The 323 miles away eight hours, as the road is only one page.
Легендарное wealth, which the authors of the Caspian Sea oil, here, in the province, while not добралось.
But Пилата Фатулаева (48) convinced that Лерике than there is in the interest of tourists.
“In May, Baku Welch фестивалем songs of the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year we will meet other the oldest people in the world,” says Фатулаева.
She is the director of the museum longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here задокументирована biography of roughly eight dozen талышей of these seats, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to a black-and-white picture.
This is my grandfather, he here 120 years.
In the age of 136 years it has another child was born
But the controversial star of the museum is чабан Ширали Мюслюмов, which allegedly marked the 168 years.
Birth certificates, however, is not.
And given that старейшему man, whose age подтвержден files, marked the 12 years of age, is extremely dubious Мюслюмова.
“He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,” explains Фатулаева.
The man was is married three times, and he had a child at the age of 23, 136 years he allegedly was born daughter.
So whether чабан Мюслюмов added a couple of decades to its age?
After all, even Рембрандт Шольц, researcher in the age of the Institute of Max Ростоке, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia.
“A lot of people have advanced age can be found in some areas of China, Japan or the valley Хунза in Pakistan,” says Шольц, “on сардинии also live extremely many very old people.”
However, because of a lack of documents the scientific confirmation of age is impossible, because there was no реестров civil state.
Every day, a glass everywhere
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the district of Лерика strikingly often reaches the biblical age.
Now here 20 people over the age of 100 years.
Why here, in the south, so many долгожителей?
Azerbaijani экскурсовод Fareed Мугимзаде explains this special genes талышей.
The director of the museum Фатулаева, by contrast, believes that the deal in nutrition.
Талыши like meat, bread and most dairy products, many of them on выпивают стакану everywhere, every day, but hardly a высококалорийная diet can be healthier with диетологической'point of view.
Or, in the case of первобытном lifestyle that keeps people in youth? Ченгемиране, tiny селении not far from the city's Лерик, live Рубаба мирзоева.
In 97 years, it is still relatively young for these широт.
Мирзаева, which argues that it has 143 потомка, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It sits in the semi with бочкой oils, which tirelessly катает 94-here.
Here, under one крышей live eight people, including one of the sons and daughter Мирзаевой, which long ago already have their grandchildren.
Also nearby скачут two малышей.
On the kitchen guests prepare tea, which shows in the typical пузатых стаканах армуду.
The Мирзаевой perfectly flat 2011 and the solid white teeth, under the headscarf she hides long dark русые косы that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always have my hair молоком, so that they never выпадали and retained the color.
“And I never enjoyed шампунем,” says Мирзаева.
Ежемесячной pensions lacking on life
She always ела only that grew in its own backyard, tomatoes, картофель, горошек.
For all the life I never buy products in store.
She then recounts his муже, who served in the army.
Harder just after World War II.
But became better, when the “favorite” father Heydar Aliyev was at the helm.
Propaganda is frequently in the speeches of the old women.
But the cult of the father of the nation, conceived around figures, who rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son ильхам.
Yet among азербайджанских where there is poverty.
230 манатов (roughly equal to the same amount of euro) Мирзаева receives a month as a pension, for local conditions, this sum, which can live well.
And, possibly, long ago grew up the son of Мирзаевой, too, is right: “old men in our culture have deep respect.”
They live in a large family, любимы, surrounded by nurturing and happy.
What is the reason for the stay alive as long as possible

The word “human right” is not in the Constitution
The revolution was back in Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo reveal deep splits the country.
The future constitution, based on, they were beaten, furious fight back.
The egyptian president not скупился on verve.
We must create a transition.
“And his success rests on my responsibility to the nation and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was overwhelmingly to all people, but first and foremost to the christian коптам, liberals, просвещенным Muslims and нерелигиозным egyptians.
After all, they are all still hopelessly разобщенные растерянной in opposition, feel the fear.
The fear of a religious state in ниле at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, hardly извиняясь, said that he temporarily cut the competencies Constitutional Court and expand its authority, “to save the revolution.”
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer with a degree of american doctors of the University of Southern California, is not entirely clear egyptians and the world.
Whether out of the forces of the judiciary?
In fact 234 articles have quietly in ночной 15-hour скачке with impediments to исламистски настроенном Constitutional Assembly of 100 participants, and it is partly the cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that proceedings relies on the “principles of islamic law”.
But that means “principles”?
This was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists would use the blurred wording and the emerging in connection with her legal люфт for a strict interpretation of Shari'a.
At the very least, it suggests one нововведенная article: in all matters concerning the Sharia, should attract for the Council of the University of Al - Ашар, Supply islamist institution of the country, something more authority in Sunni Islam.
This should not, but could mean that the clergy надзирает for legislation that de facto would be the limit of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution is the subject of much readings
Another problem: should stay подсудность civilian-military trial.
These courts in a period of Mubarak's power served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody until 11.000 were civilians.
Also, as discussed in the project, the state must safeguard “the true nature of the egyptian family” and “maintain its morals and values.”
Юридически this ill-founded so that public institutions with the help of this article can even control the content of movies and literature.
Open the text of this means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no article sets no straight equality of men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
But what is an insult and how it should be paid for by, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the formula that bans “insulting people.”
Whether enough will be critical to President or jokes about правоведа?
The question of how much and in this project, which offers on Morsi's signature and who, in his words, “very soon” will be presented egyptians on the referendum.
“The revolution is back”
Already several weeks is shaped by the opposition against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual consensus on the evening Friday in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy this document before it can enter into force.
“The revolution was back, and we defeat,” said Хамдин Саббахи занявший, third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy ministry official Mohammed El-Baradei said that the draft constitution “a place to dump the history.”
Through the service short news Twitter he accused Morsi's supporters in the desire to lead a “coup against democracy.”
“If he were to declare a referendum, we work to his Palace and скинем his,” said оппозиционер Яссер Said.
“We are not tired, the blood of our brothers still not отмщена,” quoted the egyptian media opposition policy Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they do not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
“The Koran is our constitution.”
A well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, have called for demonstrations, but the opposite of caution to the wind, not the Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer on other shores of the Nile before Каирским University.
It took part in a large number of women under покрывалами and adherents of Salafis, who shouted: “people requires the application of God's law.”
They demanded from Morsi's: “очисти country!” and reassured: “the Koran is our constitution”.
The struggle for power over символичной Square, on which all began, have created a state of near civil war.
Morsi's supporters, clearly, did not want to go on this risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood announced that, as opponents and supporters of the draft statements out loud and clear.
Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box in the direction the country should go.
The majority of the project for the Islamists, it is seen as a done deal.
“The concept of “human rights” is not mentioned anywhere.”
Hafiz Abu Саеда livid at this форсированного constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all the social forces.
48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (ЕОПР) defended the Muslim Brotherhood under Mubarak, when they sat in jail or представали before the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, and because human rights for him неделимы.
For this, he was beaten, arrested, sentenced.
And now, the words “human rights” never meet in the new constitution, he regrets in a conversation with “Welt am Sonntag”.
Morsi's expanding influence on all three branches of power in the state it is frustrating to the lawyer.
These measures represent a clear attack on the democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of to strengthen civil state, President of de-facto annulled his,” regrets Саеда.
After all, without the civilian public organizations democracy can function.
Саеда feels that all got out, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on ниле with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be retaliation.
Демонстрант on Tahrir Square warns: “you создаете monster that cannot control.”

The Norwegian ракфиск: the most foul пахнущая fish in the world?
The population пятимиллионного Norway one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but also throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of success of this country as it is linked with the local an addiction to one extremely зловонному рыбному блюду?
Take a few перезревших кусков cheese.
Поместите them in piles of dirty and потной sports clothing.
Leave them there for недельку.
You could smell отшибающий обоняние ракфиска - one of the world's most famous норвежских деликатесов.
I am in a small town called Фагернес, in three hours away from Oslo.
Around covered in snow живописные. this is a very good, but in the air разлит неистребимый signature smell.
Ракфиск is форель, посыпанная солью and бродившая in water up to a year, depending on how it is душка needed to do.
As the massing сумерки and холодает, crowds gather on the other in норвежцев Фагернесе devoted to this himself, say so, захватывающему блюду.
“Her eating raw and запивают рюмкой аквавита, local тминной vodka,” explains Хавард Хальварсен, local пожарный profession and moonlighting ракфисковый “General”, which is holding a festival.
All around us, people eat нарезанную кубиками small fish and its запивают немалыми спиртного portions.
“Someone more like аквавит than ракфиск,” says Хавард.
This напиток перебить can smell.
I have a couple of пробую shreds.
If пронести piece under the noses, everything is not all bad – than a little different from the serving sushi, which you long возили with a bus.
Ракфиск - this is the Norwegian product from completely other times, the poverty, when, even before the advent of the холодильников, fish in the autumn замачивали герметически closed бочках соленой with water.
Then a deep in the winter, when fish are already well and thoroughly забродила, it removed and, приглушив perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
Even the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of норвежцев were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrating, mainly in the US.
Now, as the population rapidly grows more than 13% are immigrants, which involve these jobs, higher wages and advanced social welfare system.
Residents of Sweden (a longtime rival, and yet not so long ago and far more зажиточного neighbor) en masse coming here to work.
Ракфиск is seen as some kind of an important symbol, непременный, albeit somewhat зловонный element of past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, there are expensive – small бокал beer or сандвич would cost you in 9 pounds sterling ($14).
Norway has rarely appeared in the world news, and most of the country, it seems, please.
People here still reluctant to mention the name of the general, Anders Breivik, the right-wing экстремиста расиста and, in the past year расстрелявшего and kills 77 men, women and children.
Not to mention his name, the original called “what happened on July 22 .”
Норвежцам it is very difficult to believe that, in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens has proven to be capable of such atrocities and killing.
At the heart of today's well-Norway is growth (since 1970), one of the largest нефтегазовых industries in the world.
“But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our g, разносящая подносы with выдержанным ракфиском, a woman with long светлыми hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of нордического prosperity.
We the people – as you call it – рассудительный.
Like most норвежцев, it perfectly speaks English.
We do not love выставляться on display, we not хвастливы.
Norway's very Nehru carefully treats its oil revenues, much of the oil industry invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the financial crisis, when all the World сорили money, which they have not been, Norway бережливо подсчитывала all costs.
“As long as we can drive on лыжах walk in winter and summer approaches, that is enough for happiness,” says Anna.
“And there are ракфиск,” she adds with беззаботным [.
I stand in the snow in the queue for any food - ракфиска with me enough.
This is гамбургер with лосиным flesh is certainly exoticism, вкусное сочное meat.
But the evening awaits us even more of the same fish with незабываемым odor.
In my hotel spend special ужин devoted to ракфиск, in which visitors votes determine the best or, perhaps, the most ароматную fish.
There is direct телеэфир, in which the show's top wearing a tie - бабочке, surrounded by тарелками with ракфиском.
It's like песенный competition “Eurovision Song Contest.”
“So, тор - Jürgen assessment of what you put in the best fish there, up in the mountains?”
“Yes, this is our assessment Хавард,” …
All laughing at and applaud.
Someone falling off a chair, perhaps перебрав аквавита.
And can simply надышавшись odor of this fish.

Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto is no easy start careers.
As long as новоизбранный Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join in the office, the BBC correspondent Уилл grant invites us to look at the difficulties, with whom he will face, and the mixed expectations of his country.
Road traffic in Mexico City now, especially in a pickle.
The city heavily loaded transport and in the best of times, and on Monday were возведены стальные barrages, перерезавшие several key exhibit to the capital and вызвавшие chaos on the roads.
But this was not done in order to not give people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protests get to Parliament building.
On Sunday in a new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto наденет presidential перевязь and take the reins of the country.
It is not an easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which now складывает their authority, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed order 60.000 lives.
“My government says the people of Mexico about its willingness to deal with violence,” reported earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto, US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, White House.
I intend to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements, next to the President of the United States, the political career of Mr Peña Nieto has evolved as the governor of his home state of Mexico City.
At his home, in a vast and populous state, the capital of the country, opinions are divided about the new leader.
Прямолинейный man
In идиллическом town Валье - de-cheers for, for example, to remember him with warmth.
People call him to take credit for the revival of tourism, the development of the tourist areas and the creation of infrastructure.
Before the city can get one of the new highway, built Mr th Peña Nieto, who are fundamentally different from the roads with выбоинами and ямами, who were previously on this point.
A placard with his name висят modern building on the sports center and a magnificent interactive museum, посвященном climate changes.
“We have come to associate with it, hope for real and serious changes,” says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Ольвера Эрнандес, Congressman from state-led Peña Nieto институционно - Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect a real and dramatic change, which is so badly needed in our country, primarily in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of uninterrupted years in power, the PRI party was left in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Ольвера acknowledges that, after his 12-year-old in the presidential palace Los Angeles Пинос party is pinning high hopes on Enrique Peña Nieto.
Moreover, he refuted charges that the new president бессодержательности united opposition.
He is very прямолинеен and very предан trial of the implementation of their vision for the future of the country.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man умеющий listen.
But in other parts of the state, many people had a different view of the former губернаторе.
Несауалькойотль municipality, also known under the name Сьюдад - Неса, marks a contrast with the разительный мощеными улицами Валье - de-cheers for.
The hidden under эстакадами highways, he is the sense in many suburbs of the Mexico City.
And the problems in муниципалитете also wear the rigid nature of this мегаполиса.
Earlier this year for the pacification of the drug gangs, trading in these areas, were enticed by the troops; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
On пустыре near the vast dumping only for the past two years, have been found dozens of bodies of women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during губернаторства Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than the average in such a notoriously violent city прославившемся Сьюдад - Хуарес, name which нарицательным, when it comes to murder innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto, the missile shield him, in the best case, it can be said that, during his tenure as governor, he has not managed to cope with the problem of killings of women.
In the worst case, his administration accused in complete ignoring this problem.
Жительница concrete homes, like most of the homes in this area, обветшалом Иринея Буэндия barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his daughter of the late Марианы moon.
According to the official version of the Мариана in 2010, had committed suicide.
But her family believes that she killed her сожитель.
“When I was gone before her home, it seems that her body before this вымыли,” recalled Miss Буэндия.
There were signs that it was beaten by, and the body has already окоченело.
The mother Марианы пересказывает this history, and the daughter of the portrait looks at us from the wall, where it hangs alongside распятием, on which начертано just one word: justice.
It is in this, they say, has been denied this family.
“The state officials appealed to me as from old сплетницей, discontented нарушительницей calm.
They want people to simply accept the faith of all that, they say, and помалкивали.
But that is wrong, so can be, especially when there is so much the violations and недочетов,” she says.
Putting on the presidential перевязь on Saturday, President of Peña Nieto, with it will take on the difficult responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico, affecting the crimes associated with violence, and the new president promised to make a decision on this issue priority during his tenure.
“I hope that he will be exactly the same as the president was governor,” says Ольвера, Congressman from Валье - de-cheers for PRI.
But this is precisely what most fear the families of victims in Сьюдад - Неса.

Bradley Мэннинг not complained about abuse, the indictment says.
Prosecutors are trying to rebut claims by Bradley Manning of poor conditions of detention in custody.
In the course of the hearings the increased attention has been paid пребыванию Manning in military prison in Квантико, staff Вирджиния.
The protection of demands to close the case on the grounds that the conditions of imprisonment Manning were brutal.
The US army rank-and-file is accused in the abduction of thousands of secret documents.
In the indictment Friday tried to prove that ordinary Bradley Мэннинг, accused in the largest drain classified materials in US history, not used multiple opportunities to send a complaint of abuse, which, in his words, he has taken, locked in a military jail.
During interrogation by перекрестного досудебном слушании in форт - Миде, the state of Maryland, the military prosecutor Major Эшден Feign said that the records of weekly visits to Manning representatives of the administration in prison for nine months of his detention in Квантико, staff Вирджиния, does not contain complaints about abuse.
Caught in the review of the interrogation of a motion to stop the Manning, on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the day after Мэннинг said that, under guard, he intended to commit suicide.
A military expert analysis of the intelligence data, arrested in June 2010, is accused in the abduction of thousands of secret documents during service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks source has confirmed that the source of the information was precisely Мэннинг.
During the hearings in the Friday prosecutor Feign together with Мэннингом every reports that заполнялись after Manning visits to the representatives of the administration during his years in jail Квантико, where he was on a strict regime of imprisonment from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison officers were supposed to answer questions and Мэннингу записывали his answers.
When the prosecutor asked Feign in Friday about reports, Мэннинг acknowledged that evaluates appeal to him by the administration of the prison as “an excellent”, and the general conditions of imprisonment as “very профессионально organized.”
Discussed reports do not contain complaints about abuse, although Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, argues Feign.
Мэннинг replied that he expressed concern about these issues and устную that посещавшие his administration officials discussed these issues with him and said that they should, but not adopting this in writing.
“They are lacking записывали “problem” (after the discussion of my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the subject in a conversation,” says Мэннинг.
The military judge, Colonel Дениз линд, also asked Manning, why not complained about mean false message with him in January 2011, during a meeting of the Commission, рассматривавшей suicide intentions, which he expressed in writing for several months before.
Мэннинг said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve, with the removal of the regime to him “warnings” accidents won and softened conditions of imprisonment.
Representatives of the military leadership made it clear that the limited detention regime-levels lower than the regime supervision to prevent suicides-was introduced to protect the prisoner, but also for the sake of the security of others.
“I wanted to give the administration know that with me all in order to rescind the regime warnings accidents won … to the level of my life improved, from my point of view,” explained Мэннинг.
In Thursday's Мэннинг testified about his arrest in Iraq and transferred to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months, before being converted in prison at the naval base in Квантико, staff виргиния, in July 2010.
He told me that the thoughts of suicide, it has appeared in Kuwait, and that once he had lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically very hard, when you are not known, as is your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world сжался to base Camp Арифжан, to my prison, said Мэннинг in Thursday's.
“I thought, I'm going to die in that cage.”
In Квантико, Мэннинг, in his words, that most of the time, in a small cell-at least 21 an hour, and often even more than 23 hours a day in a wilderness.
Мэннинг reports that he will be allowed to leave only матрас, blanket, шлепанцы, several of the clothing and score.
He says that he has tried to move, as sleep or even simply lie in дневное time ban rules.
According to Manning, while they sleep in our eyes he constantly Bill light, проникающий outside chambers.
If the guards do not have seen his face, when he переворачивался in постели at night, then, in his words, his будили and was forced to turn over on the back.
The lawyer Manning left the official argument about неправомерного treatment with Мэннингом in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning stole in military prison in форт - Ливенворт, state of Kansas.
Moreover, on Friday the judge расспросила Manning's statement, which he made during дачи in Thursday's testimony, that after one night of his forced sleep обнаженным in his cell in Квантико, forced him to stand naked before the set of guards and other prisoners on утренней tested.
Мэннинг said that not having to прикрыться blanket during the review.
In response to questions, the judge in Friday, Мэннинг said that understood from ordering a guard that should throw a blanket, which could hide, but admitted that no one did not directly приказывал he abandoned his.
In Thursday's Мэннинг stated that the previous night his forced to sleep naked for his attempts to show офицеру that he poses no risk to themselves.
Мэннинг reported that офицеру said, that would use the резинку трусов or шлепанцы to травмировать itself, but has not done so.
That night, according to Manning, his нижнее underwear, шлепанцы and withdrew from the camera points.
His lawyers hope that the judge, at least, would incorporate that he had suffered in the conclusions, and substantially reduce term of imprisonment, if Мэннинг found guilty in military court, which must begin to examine his case in the beginning of next year.
Protection has said that it plans to offer Мэннингу accept blame for less serious crimes, and other charges, challenging as excessive.
The resumption of hearings planned for this weekend, it is expected that the charges will insist that conditions in detention were justified.
The Pentagon argues that Мэннинг содержался in Квантико in accordance with the rules governing the content of those arrested with the most stringent regime.
Among the charges, urged by Мэннингу, числятся pandering opponent, illegal promotion of ongoing data on the Internet, the transfer of information on national defense, and the abduction of public property or records.
If he is convicted on all counts обвинительного act, he may be faced with life imprisonment.

My crisis of national self-determination-American narrative of mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to implement themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind people of the country's complex time.
Рубен Наваретте believes that Mexicans of american origin разрываются between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I passed on коридору for coming, close to the border controls and stalled on the spot.
Signs point to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my entire life called мексиканцем.
This is simply a contingent name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves ирландцами, and friends from New York to see themselves as the Italians.
Later, I stopped at the complex design “American of mexican origin.”
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, at home, my grandfather, there was no need for provisional titles or complex конструкциях.
I was simply the American.
I say speaking Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary of poorer than the carriers of the language, and I can't get rid of the american emphasis.
Because I достал his american passport and was in place for Extranjeros.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when the president-elect of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda was usual for meetings of the presidents of these issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
The president of Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of Mexico's economy, which Mexicans now, with the same success, will remain in Mexico, instead, to перебираться in the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada, and create some североамериканский trade bloc like the European Union.
Moreover, the president of Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not hit.
For Mexico's relationship with the United States is hard and old scores исполненный question.
Most Americans have never thought about that, in 1848, the United States moved to Mexico and under дулом винтовок forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But Mexicans minded centuries, not минутами, and see reminders of those events around.
So it is only of any US state деятелю обмолвиться any word of criticism in the side of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the mexican society here, there are complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants Монтесумы преисполняются воинственностью.
In this most complex relations with Mexico are more than 35 million Americans of mexican descent living in the US.
You want to talk about the grievances?
Their enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, the people who find themselves in this country for opportunities, and those for whom there is no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, фениксе, Denver or San Antonio so many people of mexican descent and only for one reason: at some point, their family history anyone-father or grandfather-not having to implement themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of all, it was a certain type of Mexicans — смуглые, малообразованные, from poor farming families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about this.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the american dream, we studied in good schools and good work on устроились, but we do not forget that even this dream-America, not Mexico's.
Our national self-determination muddled and unclear, but we know what to believe their country.
The United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the mexican elite ruling class, and we do not like.
We are with them the same.
They see us as a reminder of the degrading поражениях and refer to us as a people, as a second-class ненастоящим Mexicans.
We are not talking about well-speaking Spanish, and our ties with Mexico are not strong.
Our very existence for them because of the failure.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would now for шелковым fog, finding in the US сытую life, but having lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved in the United States even in childhood, and it reminds me of that, between the real Mexicans and Americans of mexican descent, there is some friction-Mex четче understand their national identity, and Americans of mexican descent this обидно.
She гражданка US and believes that belongs to both countries.
At the same time, I know many Americans of mexican descent does not feel neither belonging to one of them.
We слушаем mexican group the Tigres del Norte, but love and Брюса Спрингстина.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lost roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
And in the us we call Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relationship is not enough without the intertwined, some mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans to the mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the US.
We could tell their friends-Americans, which is a great country, and how nice of her to attend, and might be persuaded to political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Ага, of course.
Nothing will come.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and binge outlets, many of us do not believe this country too great.
I'm sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, амигос.
And this is true.
If the majority of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States, as they did with half-a - century ago, Mexico, and they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of mexican descent still in обиде for, most recently in Mexico with the interests of their relatives.
Yes, definitely.
If anything, we have more in common than it seemed to me.

The old battles in the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
It is possible to long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
There are, as a conventional, pointless debate about who first began; many buildings ruined; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, with the territory of Gaza rockets have fallen in neighborhoods of the capital of Israel's Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном conflict in the Middle East have change.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the “Arab Spring” закружили мятежной storm in many well-established realities, with the Israelis and the Palestinians failed to remain aloof from вихря, shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their fight will become even more bloody than previously.
But there are reasons that offer hope for a way out of this impasse mortal.
War without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed by 21 November, will be honored, occurred this week clashes only strengthened siloviki on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, chat to power in Gaza in 2007, 2008 from that they forced Israel to back down, despite the losses they incurred.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the groups were destroyed, and 1.7 million inhabitants blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas expands its popularity in the West Bank is one of the Palestinian-controlled territory currently in the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that the time to work on them.
As the influence of islamist movements in the arab world, Hamas creates new powerful and rich friends.
A resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among muslim countries, has the support of Hamas; it followed the example of Qatar, one of the richest and carried states of the Persian Gulf.
Торжествующие supporters of Hamas' claim of an islamic crescent around Israel from Lebanon in the north, in which governs militarized group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels to overthrow the rule of Bashar Assad's, and then to Jordan, where the king's power to Hamas' s allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region happened on Israel's southern border, in the most populous and important arab country, in Egypt, where President Morsi Мухаммеде strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention support for Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are, in many ways a parallel with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In the future, the diplomatic расстановках Hamas could become a significant player, whose voice is not able to damp down even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard-line” in Israel will come to different conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was повержен.
Israeli missile system “Iron купол” justified its creation and successfully destroyed many of the agent of Hamas rockets.
Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US remained committed to their fixed positions; many european countries also assigned blame for the beginning of the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular with Binyamin Netanyahu's government, which has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite that, since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis killed by missiles, produced by a delegation from Gaza, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the walls, which comes on the territory of the West Bank, a large part of the непризнанного palestinian state-and protects the jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegitimacy of such action from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party-as part of the preparations for the looming on 22 January elections-teamed up with even more aggressively-conservatives under Авигдора lieberman, quite удобна.
What is the point of pandering to the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If put in their hands all power in the West Bank, not whether they begin to launch rockets toward Israel from there, as do their fellow in Gaza?
Better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise its head.
Perhaps, supporters of the “hard-line” will win; but their calculations can be disproved the Arab spring.
With that, the Islamists, who have come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings toward Israel, their priority is domestic problems.
Part of the defense budget, Israel's more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism, Egypt's President Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on cease-fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change.
In Israel, not less, must take account of the long-term consequences of their policies.
At least the onset of democratic change in arab countries, the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that, sooner or later, will explode in the occupied territories, Israel, like автобусу взорванному in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the jewish state, and the demographic aspect-the growth of arab population-only exacerbate these problems.
The violent operations, which are taking place every few years on the territory of Gaza to Hamas, must pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external импульсе
It remains the only solution, to which reiterated calls for the sane, representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.
There remains the hope, not too big in the short term, in the hope that a cease-fire would allow other countries to effectively influence on the sides of the conflict.
Egypt, which has a long time to accept the decision to shut down the supply of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, a good position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the jewish state, with the 1967 with land and a combination of Jerusalem.
Other arab countries must also make efforts toward reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more for the creation of a palestinian state, the upcoming vote in the United Nations, which can become a virtual recognition of palestinian statehood.
Its role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows a reluctance to tap into solving the problem.
It is a disastrously same short-position.
The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia's entry into force of the law about унифицированной packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about smoking images of damage and struck down by illness, parts of the body контрастно stand out on green унылых коробках, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world to practice the australian law однотипной packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products entered into force, replacing логотипы цветное and forging of different brands of equal коробкой bleak-olive color with dire snapshot hit by the disease of parts of the body and the images of the children's health, which undermined their smoking parents.
Aside from different pictures and надписей, warning of the damage smoking, the only difference between with buckets, introduced in обязательном order with this субботы - name brands, that same small напечатаны шрифтом.
This is the most severe in the world conditions for formalizing упаковок tobacco products.
Australia's federal government claims that the goal of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the вредную habit of fashion status.
At the heart of the decision became the results of studies that demonstrate that people are starting to smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100, never become курильщиками.
“It is clear that, even in the most юном age children understand the sense that tobacco companies are trying to communicate with the help of formalizing strips,” Health Minister поясняет таня Плиберсек, referring to research that performed that, for example, the crown in логотипе associated with children with the idea of Princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the least in the world of smokers, so that these changes will not count on profits, multinational corporations, but the possibility of similar measures have already seen and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will increase the share of the black market, which will be sold on the cheap and available cigarettes.
“This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his start the,” believes Scott Макинтайр, a representative of the company British American Tobacco in Australia.
Budget manufacturers of products from China and Indonesia will provide far more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws are conducive to the growth of the business.
Сандра ха from a small family company Zico Import Pty ltd argues that demand for портсигары and силиконовые футляры, скрывающие unpleasant images on the packaging, rapidly grew up (with almost zero), since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the high court in Australia, where tried to appeal the law.
According to сандры ха Zico, the company has already implemented the order of six thousand products wholesale businesses and expects a new party.
For us, this is a good business.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to the experts, the popularity of social networking among the very part of the population, which are aimed at these measures.
After making a series of laws in Australia, make illegal tv advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers put cigarettes in plain sight, advertising tobacco products moved to the Internet.
Australia's government has banned the local companies and Web sites to locate advertising in the network, but it cannot limit in this foreign sites.
“If you торгуете табачными изделиями and you have remained only this small лазейка, the idea of advance its product in the Internet you seem very temptation,” поясняет Беки grocery, исследующая questions of public health at the University of Sydney.
Фримен marks a rise in the number of review on brands, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, such as social networks, like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this is a matter of rank-and-file citizen, who so loves Marlboro cigarettes, not wished forces and time and made the broadcast, or is behind this рекламная company?
The australian bottling British American Tobacco, argues that the industry is now more involved in adapting to the new rules, than an advertisement.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new rules: these are the state's claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade has been unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all of these countries' trade relationship with Australia is quite small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to the government, the collective Плиберсек обсуждало with other countries to take similar laws on their packaging.
In 2001, Canada has introduced the first proof of posting photos of warning about the damaging of smoking.
Now, this rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia had not obeyed improvements.
These images of me not задевают.
I simply do not обращаю attention.
“Simply выхватываешь cigarette and прячешь пачку in the pocket,” Viktor поясняет el Хейг, покупающий cigarettes with фотографией tumor ротовой полости on пачке.
Frankly, the only thing that can force me to give up-this is my small дочка.
James Йу заведующий магазином tobacco products, King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same упаковка's complicated the task of positioning goods at полкам
“Before I have the new party разгрузку уходил hour, and now four hours,” he complains.
“The government need to take and quite ban cigarettes, then we would say: what to do, Or, all but closes shop,” he says, вскидывая hands up.

Скучать electronic networks in the world and the permanent connections is not all bad.
In this day of благодарения I suddenly had to be five hours at the airport, because our plane surfaced mechanical dislocations and replaced by another aircraft, which we and дожидались.
Thus, I had plenty of time for reflection about the nature of boredom.
I would not fool you.
Полдня at the airport in anticipation of рейса - it really bored, and there is not much help, no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even the shops беспошлинной trade.
But lately, more and more scientists and experts in childhood development is in favor of boredom.
They say that, in certain situations, for us and for our children скучать is not all bad.
This leads to an interesting brain distracted ancillary topics that may contribute to creativity.
And because, in the modern world, we all are constantly facing what any screen, the benefits of boredom passed by us.
Can be we need to strive to boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time there is.
We are back to that.
Before I, like many, believed that скука - invention about recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not so, argues Peter туи, a professor of Greek and Roman history, the canadian University of Calgary, author of the book “увлекательная history of boredom” (Boredom: a Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact скука boasts very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls in Помпеях discovered latin calligraphy of boredom, датируемые first century.
It remains an open question about how we understand скуку.
The problem is, says John D. Иствуд, адъюнкт - University Professor at the University of York in Онтарио, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often изменялось.
Learning materials research on this topic and asked the question of targeting a group of 100 people, a professor of Иствуд and his colleagues came to the next definition: скука - this is when people “want, but can't do that, generating them satisfaction.”
The difference between скукой and apathy, he says, is that people скучающий not doing something that would want to do.
Apathy with nothing to do not want.
In the main переживаемой boredom, he says, it is a “violation of the attention and associated with the deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time reaching slowly.”
On described скука can seem very like a depression.
But Professor Иствуд argues that, despite the possible link between these состояниями скучающие, people see the reasons for the problems in the world and circumstances, and people undergoing a depression, see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes it seems that we bored when, in fact, we just find it difficult to concentrate on something.
In his study “Незанятый mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention”, published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Иствуд with colleagues cite conducted earlier experiment, participants who listened to a recording voice читающего magazine.
Some participants also heard loud sounds, not as a matter of television programs, включенной in a neighboring room, others have heard these same sounds low громкости, so that they could barely break, and a third group only listened to a recording votes without звуковой pathways.
Those participants who heard the tv with low громкости, noted that they were bored, more often than the other – it was difficult to focus, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed this boredom.
When we try to concentrate attention on the difficult task of attention, or a fascinating abnormality can cause скуку, says Mark J. Фенске адъюнкт, a professor at the University of the Neurosciences Institute Гвельфа, Онтарио, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do anything неинтересное, “for example, всматриваясь in the flow of products on конвейере in search of a marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom.”
It continues to it that when people start to покачиваться on a chair or paint каракули листе on paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such action is simply not help we relax physically.
“The study showed that children who do not prohibit ерзать and go round, learn more and запоминают more information than children, from which require смирно sit,” says Professor Фенске.
In some moments we all feel скуку: with delay рейса (as in my case), listening to the speech, scanning монотонную неинтересный film.
But different people have different propensity to demonstrate the extent of boredom.
In the 1980's to measure such individual features, the researchers have developed a special “metrics prone to boredom.”
For the definitions of such a scale used questions and statements, for example, “a lot of what I have to do, and однообразно монотонно” or “me too much interesting, so the lack of time”.
With the help of these вопросников researchers have identified that boys missile more often than girls, says Steven Воданович, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular with a variety of external раздражителей.
But in general, teenagers in general often missile.
In 1991, Mr. Рид Ларсон, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he связывался through пейджера with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said that they bored in school and during the implementation of household tasks, and 23% said that they bored outside school.
With only 3% of parents admitted that they bored.
Professor Ларсон notes that it has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom, now, 21 years later.
But he knows that, in the age of “подростковый must peak prone to boredom,” mainly because children and teenagers are not permitted to fully address than they do.
Back to my original question: скука useful?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme manifestations of it, as studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky азартным games or abusing certain chemicals in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the connection between скукой and творчеством, says Professor Воданович, examining this issue in more than two decades.
“So our brains suggests that we should do something else; it is скука,” says-Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the City University of New York.
But this is not always the most brain knows, it is better to tackle.
If you are bored and you направите this energy on the game on гитаре or кулинарные опыты, you will be making themselves better.
But if you would watch tv, you will be better off just in time, and soon it will pass.
So, if your child скучает and you give him the ipads, he stops скучать, but he will learn to grapple with скукой on its own or as any other way to manage their time and employment, says Professor Фенске.
“And such skills of independent regulation задействуются in the different situations,” he argues.
Your child learns not only on their own to occupy themselves something, he is also studying самоконтролю at all.
I do not think that скуку need as the praise.
But consider it a bad thing, too, should not be.
Rather, should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Иствуд agree with this.
“We see this so that we need more experience скуку, with скука - this is very unwelcome, unquenchable desire to tackle something rational way,” he says.
In fact, people want something отключиться from constant concern and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are used to the constant over-stimulating the senses, he says, and when there is a silence, we теряемся and did not know what to do.”

While it is unclear how the new law will be applied to the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Ороско девятнадцатилетний soccer team player, and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado State accused of committing criminal offences, заключающегося that will soon be totally legitimately throughout the state: possession of a small dish of cannabis and the tube, in which he's smoking.
Mr Ороско says that one day in September, he was with friends in Ламаре and drove in car on прерии near the border with Канзасом, when police stopped them.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr Ороско agenda came in court for drug possession and ownership of приспособлением for drug use, petty offenses, each of whom причитается fine of $100, and appointed by the date of the meeting.
“We treated as criminals,” says Mr Ороско.
But criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been underway for several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of the hundreds of small-scale trials depends not so much on the law, how many seats from consideration.
The charges in the small правонарушениях associated with molecular, already bets in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has passed a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped file charges in people age 21 and older, for possession of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks after the law takes effect.
But in the more conservative constituencies Colorado prosecutors decided to consider the existing things associated with molecular, and still have a responsibility for the storage of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs Денвера mountain areas of the West to vote for it, to prevent the emergence of in their new places, shop staff лицензированных for the sale of cannabis.
“All of this is evolving so rapidly, that I did not even know what the wait for further,” says Daniel J. Оутс, chief of police in the town аврора on East from Денвера.
Representatives of regulators in Washington State also озадачено почесывают heads.
They will form the rules for determining the order of licensing growing, processing, distribution and sale of cannabis, and all of this needs to be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most of the other states in the resolution of the issue of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, the first, and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, more than an orderly market, so they serve as a good example,” поясняет Bryan and. Smith, representative of the Council's regulation of production and marketing алкогольной products in Washington State.
But now, no one can do more, acknowledges Mr Smith, than to put some proposals and hope that this will work.
“We have no real precedent, in which we could navigate,” he says.
The Washington State, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and full year ввергнет staff in a state of uncertainty, when state licensing system is still there, and the ownership molecular already узаконено.
And there are, after all, still rocky technical aspects that need to be addressed in this period, for example, how to find a balance between распоряжением state of “adequate access” to лицензированной cannabis with a ban on the trade of it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, game sites and child care.
“It is especially difficult to locate лицензированные enterprises will trade molecular point in cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs,” Ben поясняет Ливингстон, representative of the recently created by the research group “center of the legalization of marijuana.”
21 November, chief of police of Оутс авроры sent out his underling e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office will no longer attract individuals entered age 21-year, for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stop уличать people in these violations “from this moment.”
Police chief Оутс told me that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the activity, выращивающих marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue illegal traders and распространителей drugs.
Prosecutor Уэлд counties in the north of Colorado, Ken, the LHC is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to hold accountable for the ownership of molecular, mainly to prod its users-a course of treatment.
At this moment, the Eastern agents charged in storage and less than two ounces of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations.
“The duty of our institutions-hunted for actions that are considered criminal in their moment occurs,” said Mr. the tank in his statement.
The response was uncertain, even in places like rural district Меса, where participants vote rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The grand Джанкшн, the biggest city in the district, no longer has attracted совершеннолетних responsibility for possession of small quantities of drug.
Prosecutor окружной пит Хаутцингер supported this decision, but also decided to not take charges on already open, associated with the storage of cannabis.
“I believe that, to provide for the implementation of the law, as long as it does not change-our direct responsibility,” he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of the state of Colorado, принявших vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of issues of the use of cannabis for entertainment in public and legal system will not be easy.
And the confused reaction people in different places the state laid bare-digit relationship of local authorities to experiment with molecular state.
“The окружных prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier,” Sean поясняет Макалистер денверский, the lawyer representing the interests of those convicted for possession of cannabis, and the local representative of the National Organization of reforming the laws on cannabis.
“They sought for so long people for this, that now may not truly come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington — the first states, in which a small number of marijuana, about the same as for alcohol is destined to become an experimental fields in the country to test the idea of drug legalization.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they опаской waiting for instructions from with the federal authorities, who still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of cannabis as a federal crime.
Supporters of legalization of marijuana, the hope that the management of Justice cave in this issue.
Despite a few received wide publicity arrests of traffickers and patients, употреблявших marijuana for medical depositions, the federal government in most cases gave good trade molecular for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and the 16 other states.
Bureau agents to fight drug is unlikely to rush in homes, to seize a small пакетик marijuana, but they are likely to turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities of the state stores рекреационной marijuana, which allowed for the new law, believes Kevin A. Сабет, a former advisor to combat drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the action of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores on the sale of cannabis, and so could not open up earlier than through the year.
Last week, Монтроуз city in the western part of the state, has proposed a six-month ban on trade in molecular, which appears to be approved next week.
“We do not want to be in this position, that we выдадим someone license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Николсон, a member of the city council.
Our city has voted against the amendment.
And now we have a clear contradiction between the results of the local vote, and voted for that state.
There remains a lot of unresolved issues.

Петронелла Уайэтт: I survived from at Oxford for what I'm a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views began not today.
I remember how much themselves, I always dreamed to do at Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world учебное establishment, the modern counterpart classical симпозиума закладывающий, the two foundations of civilization - свободомыслие and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, dropping out on historic факультете Вустерского College Oxford in the late восьмидесятых, I gathered чемоданы and departed, which culminated in the first real scandal in my life.
My father and weathered заплакал.
Friends were confused by the.
The Evening Standard claiming that I cast college, because I did not appreciate that my однокурсники engaged in sex in a neighboring room.
The writer E. Норманн Wilson joked that I departed, because I had to drink from щербатых чашек.
In fact, all was not as it is ironic.
I сбежала.
Yes, сбежала, because I have systematically травили and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or that I was in a private school.
I for one reason only травили, and in that it was the cradle of прославленной просвещенности a barbaric and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Уайэтт, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was сторонницей conservatives.
You ask why recall about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, follows center-right views, is subject to the same травле.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred to students-conservatives in Oxford was so strong that, last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as one that is given to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the student club college corps Christie in Cambridge, asserting that their “often actively insulate, expose personal attack and make feel нежеланными гостями” because of their political beliefs.
They want to impose on the Committee on equal rights of additional college representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation only compounded released recently on BBC 2 documentary film about politics in the students' environment “country miracles: young, smart and right”, in which the conservatives have presented эксцентриками and неонацистами.
The film depicts was Joe Cook, the former president of the Conservative Association, Oxford University Press, which ездит in роллс - ройсе, wears серебряный suit and stick with серебряным набалдашником.
In other university students-conservatives complain that they are “scapegoats for raising the cost of training.”
Люк Black explained, an 20 years, vice-president of the Association of conservatives Ноттингемского University, in an interview with one of Sunday's newspaper, said that “in a university environment increases distortion in toward the left.
People who do not even know in advance, we believe us United and with impunity буйными children of rich parents.”
Samuel Робертс, 21, a student of the historic college graduate corps Christie, in which were filed a petition about increasing protection, calls this atmosphere,” and “неуютной Стефани Черилл, 19 years, the new president of the Conservative Association, Oxford University Press, says that the members of the club to носителям center-right views dramatically worsened.
“It poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, and simply for normal life members of the club,” she says.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not simply, I was in a minority of one.
I came back in September 1986, timid and застенчивой восемнадцатилетней girl.
OXFORD лихорадило from hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year before, the University of voting have stripped the former студентку Margaret Thatcher her почетной extent due to budget cuts spending on higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be неуютно even сталинистам.
In the first days of the week первокурсника, when students знакомятся with each other and with the teachers, I experienced the first time that ждало ahead of me.
I still do not know what teachers not only overlooked during the травлю students-conservatives, but also very happy to take part.
Political issues-the strike mineworkers, privatization and oppose the government to implement sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - проникали through обшитые wooden панелями Wall audience.
On my first seminar I need was to translate the text of the eighteenth century, in English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
“Miss Уайэтт, said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, please, переведите first paragraph”.
The text давался me with hard, I запиналась.
Harry Pitt was very желчным man's face, like a cake.
“Тэтчеристы fundamentally not teach the french or they simply lack the brain?” he asked.
Other students захихикали.
I have to have the eyes of tears.
“Советую you take a few lessons in the initial french free time, if you will, of course, not very busy, discussions in society,” пробрюзжал Pitt.
I was back in his room is very sad.
In the evening, in college, I sat for dinner one; then someone похлопал me on the back.
It was James, a student with a second-rate of the english language, which is a member of the University Conservative Association.
“I know who you are, he said дружелюбно.
- Unfortunately, is as follows:
Over every, who is suspected of sympathies, conservatives will издеваться.
To me the most is not easy, but in the case of твоем they know that your father close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be difficult.
Most первокурсников - conservatives pretend that they labour”.
Later, in the local пабе, I tried to maintain a cowardly лицемерить.
I insisted that did not agree with all that, says Margaret Thatcher.
The catch failed.
Первокурсник of philosophy, politics, and economics, who himself studied in Итоне, said: “you are the daughter of fascist pigs.
You are contagious.”
Other students picked up his words.
I was flawed, dirty.
“As conservatives have sex? asked one of them.
They колотят each other, the truth?”
I feel so, as must have felt homosexuals to the removal of criminal prosecutions in шестидесятых.
Whether I will ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with minded only under cover of night?
Whether I will be forced to become a Labor and hide their true beliefs?
The three years I have become seem адом, full of hardship and solitude.
The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Стоун, a professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was Thatcher's adviser on foreign policy, and one of its спичрайтеров.
In college, he has not appeared.
He despised him for personal remoteness, pettiness, and commitment to Marxism - детерминистскому view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Билкент in Ankara, Turkey.
“Here you are not will be happy,” he told me.
I was touring in oxford from родительского at home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and friends непредвзятых metropolitan.
I told the father that hate oxford and explained the reason.
He believed me.
During his studies in сороковые years there are any political views.
“But this is the best university in the world, he said жалобно.
Is there such a not able, not only in the city of frozen шпилей …
Even my friends-communists always behaved perfectly.”
His eyes влажные помутнели.
“Not принимай поспешных decisions.
I am sure that this is just a joke.
You разобьешь me heart, if бросишь university.”
I was constantly изнурена journeys in London and my emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, not weathered the pressure and abandoned his convictions.
Next week, in time, when another teacher history very seriously called me “enemies of the people”, I decided to do the same.
In the soul сгорая from shame, I admitted that “I промыли brains parents”, and called them “old дураками.”
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the lid firmly гроба my career in Oxford was to care of my father.
At the time he wrote every week on two колонки for newspapers, star host.
My door was заперта.
I am not well, and after five minutes of my преследователи failed.
When they are gone, I gathered чемодан села and on the same train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me плаксой and тряпкой.
But in eighteen years no one should not become the object of such anger and запугиваний Lear in all.
All the sadder that it was OXFORD, which not only has released 14 prime ministers, but the Tories and, to this day, hidden behind the незаслуженной reputation of the university, in which the value equality and свободомыслие.

The biggest profession in the world: miners with Кавах - Иджена
The four euro indonesian miners risk their lives and health, втаскивая 70 kilograms of sulphur in the volcano on steep каменистым тропам
There are people, for whom their work-hell, and others are literally working in hell.
Among them Анто Виджайя, one of 400 mineworkers who earn a living prey of sulphur in вулкане Кавах - Иджен, based in the east of the island's Ява.
Every day Анто спускается hit rock bottom, where кратера сернистый gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, застывает in contact with air.
Отколов huge sacks of sulphur, the total weight which could reach 70 kilograms, he puts them in two бамбуковые basket, will place a basket on the shoulders and carry them to the top on обрывистой mountainous road.
Before the bar of the volcano, which is 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but изможденным грузчикам requires more than 40 minutes to climb черепашьим step, barely keeping the balance and carefully нащупывая path to not оступиться and not fall over the precipice.
They know that another large step could cost them life, as happened with one туристкой from France, which collapsed a few years ago with clear of the rocks Кавах - Иджена.
Miners with Кавах - Иджена earn 5 евроцентов for every kilogram of sulphur, which drill
Once at the top, they pave the path between the tourists that their фотографируют, as if they were обезьянами of circus and weary, carrying heavy basket, go three miles to the scales that горнодобывающая company расположила slightly above, rise to the occasion 1.850 meters.
It is about пт Канди Нгримби, venture, which эксплуатирует since 1960 this volcano, and better and not say, their workers, which it pays 662 indonesian rupees (5 евроцентов) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10.000 rupees (83) евроцентов нефтехимическим manufacturing, for this минерал distributed in everyday life and is used for production matches фейерверков, косметики динамита, and even for отбеливания sugar.
“So, as is the norm переноска 70 kilograms, we зарабатываем around 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for every ходку,” поясняет we Анто, which usually carries out three daily переноски.
He spends three hours to each of them and in the end feels разбитым, but they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems мизером нечеловеческого for such efforts, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
“Поденная шахтерам price is very high on the local standards, where the collection of coffee pay 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and среднемесячный earning two million rupees (167 euros),” разъясняет грузчик, who previously worked on каменщиком туристическом island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the station was not so severe, but Анто returned with his family in Баньюванги, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as massive as сера: “I'm marrying a young girl from Bali, where some индуисты, and he brought her on Яву to it adopted Islam.”
The Анто asthma, he breathes, constantly кашляет, and he слезятся eye due to toxic gases
In his 27 years Анто spent three years, risking a Кавах - Иджене, which has already begun сера checked on him, despite the availability of masks and special eyeglasses.
He has asthma, he breathes, constantly кашляет, and he слезятся eye because of the toxic gas, which emits a volcano.
This is the price that he must pay for achieving their dreams.
“Поработаю another two years, because they want to open a shop or learn spanish or french,” he promises to more than an acceptable English.
Наказанный life, this comfortable and bright young people could be туристическим гидом официантом портье, or in the hotel room, but instead he performs work мула.
Dividing the disreputable wooden hut with other носильщиками, he comes every day in the morning, two because сера not fading вытекать at night, when its signature желтый color is blue and блестит among мрака.
Challenging the shadows, Анто спускается in the crater, when covering the way small фонарем, подсоединенным to his каске, which he bought for their money.
About 400 носильщиков low basket with grey on their shoulders from the bottom of volcano
Despite the high profit margins, the company is not горнодобывающая механизировала mine sulphur for saving costs and provides no equipment носильщикам that work on their own account and with such deprivation.
In fact, they are not even part of the 30.000 rupees (2.5 euros) for фотосъемку collection, which, along with a ticket for входным 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards this заповедника взимают with tourists who come to сфотографировать volcano and its people - мулов.
“This work for cattle, and not to the people,” says Бадрусин, коренастый носильщик 42 years, who spent on Кавах - Иджене three decades since the left college.
Able to raise up to 110 kilos, he assures that will endure the job “as long as can,” because he needs money for the education of their three children aged from 18 to 10 years.
Not уйду retire, die here, because the volcano-this is all my life
Although сера обжигает жжет's throat and eyes, when suddenly, the wind is changing and catches mineworkers in плотных столбах smoke, breaking from the volcano, they are so выносливы, that no one is complaining to their worst disease … more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with the wind, артрозы, pain, to its knees and on the shoulders of the pest, which деформировались under the weight of baskets.
Балансируя basket on his back, Унайник now can only raise 50 kilos in 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades takes 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three грузовика перевозят on storehouse in Тамансари, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers on the narrow path among зарослей.
“Not уйду retire, die here, because the volcano-it all my life,” says Унайник, is opening his mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
One of his five children, older, 30 years, also works переносчиком sulphur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation of one of the severest of doing in the world: what do human mules with Кавах - Иджена.

Singapore is looking for children to save the economy.
Сингапурцы accuse career, stress and house prices, and the education of children.
“The people of Singapore needs to grow.”
My husband patriot, you are my wife патриотка, keep our civilian debt and would life!
It may seem improbable that these lines are part of advertising мятных лепешек, but despite this, or perhaps because of it-it has become хитом videos on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of рэпа, which uses local proverb like “Go suppose бао (булку) in печку” to посмеяться over the birth rate in Singapore.
Рекламное agency, which has made this video, BBH, enshrines the hope that, with the help of advertising, they can draw attention to this problem in the form of modern entertainment.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to people “live up to its national debt.”
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we need to make its веселой and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are worst in the world to reproduce itself, so we felt that this is the theme that we must touch.
We knew that the government tried to do a lot, for example to the launch of perfume with феромонами or organize parties quickly знакомств (called - свиданий).
Many of these ideas were, perhaps, but not necessarily креативными worked.
So we thought, why don't we do the same thing stepped out of possible to solve this problem, namely сочинить rap?
1.2 child
Those who do not take it so lightly, so this is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1.300 per year on policies for воодушевления citizens on the birth of more children.
Public package for couples and parents, provides up to $15.000 on child, prolongs the vacation on pregnancy and родам and provides tax breaks.
But all of this is low efficiency.
Singapore is abundant and high-tech state-city in Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and their austere public control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to his management of the national population, is currently at a rate of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below the 2-what is known as the percentage of substitution — in 1976.
So why сингапурцы do not have more children?
Вей Ming Dynasty, director of policy for couples and families of the national management by population, says that the reason the “improved education” and “more than a vast array of career opportunities.”
“This allowed people to have a broader гаммой options in terms of the life goals and priorities, aside from the wedding and the creation of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms of contributing to a rise in the number of холостяков and postponement of marriage and the birth of children, as a result of which fell fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which focused on a sharp increase in immigration for the reduction of the population, causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where barely скрываемая xenophobia thrives in many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, which has been criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is seen as one of the reasons that, in the past year, the ruling party of Singapore has received the worst outcome for election since independence.
After the election, was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has been known to impact on economic growth, the nation's tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some surprising consequences.
The government is making efforts to not has been built as much as a small house.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
Leadership on urban development moved to control the number of small apartments, known as “обувная box” that could build in certain areas of the city.
These апартаменты eco-46 square meters sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is a belief that they can promote холостому lifestyle and deprived of their incentive to developers who want to build a large family home.
But Лим Yu Sun, CEO of домостроительной firms the Developers, says that their “обувные boxes weighing” sold far faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments раскупаются for several days, even weeks, faster, more than the size of the apartment.
As a result, our cash flow is increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new regulations provide a clear framework for developers, which previously placed препоны, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too перенапряженные
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing national fertility rates, after a conversation with сингапурцами, who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems, that they will not have much effect.
“People are very overstretched us, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people this delay,” says the young practiced.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it is important to have their own money and time,” says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women cite his career, stress and housing prices and education as a reason, which make it difficult for them to have children.
So, as would the government nor has tried to prod their citizens to the birth of children, in terms of деторождения, the last word to the сингапурцами.

Key questions
Марьелос Поррас преподавательница, English and expert on education and job training, believes that, in order to target children and teenagers, need to understand that the goal of social networking-informed.
“The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites have changed the rules of the game,” she notes.
Поррас points out that academic, Mark Пренски, Master педагогики from Yale University and the author of the labor digital аборигены and immigrants, invented these terms for explanations for the phenomenon.
This digital аборигены they, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We digital immigrants, who must teach them, while we still learn themselves,” she says.
Поясняет that this theme is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criteria that can or cannot be spread, publish or speak, in the age of maturity, when not enough for this.”
“They were also to избирательны, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to specialist, the most effective way to show that such privacy children and teenagers, is to ask questions that make them think.
“Talk to them, to ensure that they do not do this, it is futile,” she adds.
Then Поррас contributes some options: there are things that you are not told незнакомцу, so why would you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked, if published a photo you like those that you published a pro his friend?
Whether you know what others publish pro you?
When you подписываешь photos with вечеринок просишь, whether you are allowing other people to celebrate them?
And another, everyone will need to know what you do in every moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they should conduct themselves online as well, as do this оффлайн.
The rules of one and the same.
“Outside of the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, so as to be in social networks,” she says.
Vigilance
Эстуардо Гуардия, university teacher, a professor of education and education consultant, explains the need to heads of households in good faith read a policy of social networking.
Understanding each of the points, they have good reason for interviews with children about предпосылках opening government recordings on the Internet.
“For example, age and that allowed to spread or publish,” he says.
According to Гаурдия, the key question-remind children lesson “not говори with nobodies.”

Unasur summit ends without Лимской Declaration
VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) finished today in Peru without Лимской Declaration, announced previously and theoretically binding signed by family members.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document, signed on VI of yet another meeting of heads of state and government of Unasur, but the sources of the office and the administration of President pointed to the main page that his surrender after closing, but then confirmed that at some point it will be published on the Web site of the Перуанского governments.
The questions about the text, they showed that the content was that Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, during the summaries of statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was all the time is limited.
During the day was only транслировано, in the room for the press, the video's Assembly-message “closed session, breath banned.”
Немногая information that циркулировала among reporters, was handed down to press secretaries of some governments Unasur, present at the meeting, but not peruvian.
The only document, widespread during the day, was on the list of participating presidents, that provoked the anger of hundreds of journalists from a variety of national and international media, which asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of President of Peru's dispatch of electronic communications media with “the final declaration of the summit”, but it is about Humala's statement, and not an official document, which ended with the summit.
Last October, Peru III accepted the south american and arab countries (АСПА), and at the time, despite the fact that it has required the press, too, was not imposed the so-called Лимская Declaration, which previously announced.
On the official Web site of the АСПА can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings, peruvian authorities tried to, to have been off the system for the transfer of all journalists, but most have limited to obtain information.
The summit also led to a joint decision of Chile and Peru, to accept the verdict of the Hague court, care of the territorial dispute between the two countries.
Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered for a regional summit and ratified, that would abide by the decision of the International Court, which starts on Monday in The Hague hearing statements from both sides, in the framework of the charges brought against Santiago, Lima.
“We will abide by and carry out a decision that разъяснит disagreements that we currently are in the International Court of Justice,” said Humala, alongside its чилийским colleague.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals,” added Piñera, and cheer пожатием hands Humala against the backdrop of the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of both presidents that they disobey the International Court, happened immediately after Colombia опротестовала this week Боготский pact, under which it accepted subordination вердиктам this international court after the decision of the maritime border with Nicaragua, which it deemed improper.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Rousseff's Дилмы; Venezuela's Hugo Chávez, Bolivia's Evo Morales,; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in the Unasur was suspended in 2011 after the impeachment of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Takes the president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for the opening of the debate in the morning and for closing the summit, later полудня Лимскому on time.
The head of state итоговый read the document, which reported that were taken 16 agreements were approved and the direction of the action on 31 project among south american countries, the amount of the alleged investment amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the adopted agreements he mentioned that Unasur countries take “important steps toward the goal of citizenship in South America, for which we расширяем agreement about the place of residence”.
He told me that the actions undertaken to improve cooperation in the fight against the “uncertainty and citizens against transnational organized crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, low-cost access to the Internet in all corners of South America and taking into account aggregate and effective way of risk of natural disasters.”
Because Europe is in crisis, “economic unification (Latin America) should not be триумфаторской foundations, and should serve to expand our manufacturing and anticipate the foundations of a better future for our cities,” added Humala.
“We decided to give the privileges of a group of 31 знаковых projects that will improve the link spaces of South America, in particular in 20,000 village and border zones … unifying our country and forming new economic framework,” said peruvian President in прочитанном.
Among the projects he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and limited поперечными осями on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The document also итоговый affected the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country would serve its re-entering the Union of South American Nations”, from which it now ruled out.
The need to Latin America was the region of prosperity and peace, would be united, and had good relations between the neighbors, was another theme, подчеркиваемой at the summit.
In this sense, the colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that hopes to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to conduct negotiations in good form on the debate as a result of the verdict of the international court, оспариваемого here.

“South America should learn from Europe on the issue of the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the “South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans “killing each other during the second World War,” and in other clashes, “but now they almost one Fatherland.”
He defended, in this context, the project of South America citizenship, which endorses the members Unasur.
“The need to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers on any south american country, as is already happening with the members of the Andean Community, but still there is a reactionary sector who want to get us back into the past,” he warned.
Эквадорский President manifested itself, moreover, a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition for reducing the influence of the Anglo-saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the San José about human rights.
Those who read lectures, never take no commitment, and we, on the contrary, подписываем южноамериканцы, everything.
“Inexplicably, Межамериканская Commission on Human Rights in Washington and is financed by the United States,” he said, referring to political asylum, the Ecuador основателю Джулиану WikiLeaks Assange.
Correa assured that no жалеет about this decision, because with him he not betraying their principles, and maintained its “deep values of democracy and human rights.”
He added that, in time, “there were some suspicions that Assange will be экстрадирован in a third country and not respected the process.”
He criticized, moreover, the swedish justice for demand arrive on its territory for interrogation about the alleged sex crimes, while “the swedish legislation thinks it is possible to implement it by видеоконференции, which can be done from Ecuador's embassy in London”.
Correa confirmed that there is a risk that the physical and mental health of Assange.
“I have not spoken to him since he arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador, I reported that he was in a small легочная problem, nothing serious,” said эквадорский head of state.
That really is, so this is the danger that his physical and mental health of заточения in a small space, without the ability to do exercise on the air.
“It affects the health of any person,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum, provided Assange since June in эквадорском embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which would allow him to go in Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and european judicial authorities and stressed that the talks were in London about the search for a solution to the problem of заточения WikiLeaks founder.
We don't speak talks about human rights, it is the word we use is not in this case, but were the constant debate.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and european judicial authorities, because the lawyer, Assange's Baltasar гарсон, leading a series of processes in different european инстанциях,” he mentioned.
And pleaded, “if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end.”
And if Sweden as well, it allows its legislation and, as it has done in other cases, допросит сеньора Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London or допросит him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa used the occasion to show himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and stressed that tolerates no “mediocrity, hazard and lies that distort the freedom of expression.”
“The enemies of freedom of the press is not tainted by villains, politicians, journalists and bad, with profits, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this sense, he remained довольным that has neither of these journalists, “neither bankers, nor the bourgeois country - гегемоны not prevail in Ecuador,” and added that, as a переизбранным, “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to retain a veto in Paraguay Unasur, at least until the next election, arguing that the agency “must be hard and will not tolerate the opportunism of coups and support under the guise of legitimacy”, because in reality “it has eroded the legitimacy of парагвайской democracy.”
Эквадорский President felt it, moreover, the “very good” to his colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos' s lead is now negotiating with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which proved good никарагуанского maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not respected.
This is a problem between south american countries and центральноамериканской.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome to go together.
Need to process their determination to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed the hope for a good conclusion to the dispute over maritime borders, which are in the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that “the right thing for Latin America engaged in international resort, if the two countries agree to accept the decision, however difficult it may be.”
Regarding the opportunity to stand as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he indicated that he is considering the possibility of “with great joy and optimism, even though sometimes it is very difficult.”
Correa assured that, if that fails in elections in February 2013, it will fade from public life.
In personal terms, I never was interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be redeemed only by the political authorities.
“My political movement сочло, that I will this victory possible, so that must accept this responsibility,” he said.
In the case of victory, it would be my last term in office, the President, and then we emerge from public life.
If they lose, the same.
“This decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with the venezuelan vice-president Николасом Maduro, who told me that he went to treatment, which had already been planned, рутинное, and that he is expected to miss out on a campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean the escalation of the health of President Chavez,” he explained.
The head of state эквадорского participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which finished with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality, and security.

Mortality from AIDS today-the result of late diagnosis
Фабрицио was 21-year, when he declared that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
“I like оглушили”, he recalls the difficult, despite the такт doctor, moment.
Юноша concealed it from his family.
Opting to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to know about it as much as possible and his efforts frustrated. - he has already noted its 43-60th birthday.
Фабрицио - one of the “oldest” patients with HIV-separate hospitals Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came in 1994, breaching plenty of obstacles.
He is living with a diagnosis of “the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has 22 years in the early 1990's, in that it would be hard to believe – then there was too little treatment options, too little of it knew about the disease, too jaundiced treating the sick.
Even so, the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection not wanted попрощаться with him, “because he was порез.”
In other words, in those times have AIDS was the sentence.
Now it may survive with this синдроме and do this without undermining the quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when the virus has already damaged the, “drew” their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
Later, 31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least after the first alleged cases, “a great achievement for the moment is that the survival of a patient who is treated in a timely manner, and the survival of the overall population in exactly the same,” pointed out the head of HIV-secession HCG, Хайме Андраде Вильянуэва, citing that this information is confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Инфекционист and expert on HIV / AIDS, Андраде Вильянуэва explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depends on the extent of the defeat of immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the expected length of life, those who did not consume drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when a reported 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive in the age of 25 years, according to these терминам, “maintaining control, can live without the problems of up to 75 years,” he explained.
To assess the progress, should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today at an average annual rate of 76 years.
Although the mortality has fallen dramatically in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (annual report ЮНЭЙДС), it is also true that, since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database died.
Only in Халиско 255 people died in 2011, and has already recorded 187 deaths by May of this year; however, argues that although there are ubiquitous access to the drug since 2005.
Why, so far, is a lethal the outcomes?
Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I am, so this is the case in our hospital.
At a minimum, the past 12 years we have had no shortage of медикаментах, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about his инфицированном position, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He led сокрушительные data: “nine out of ten patients come when, already have some оппортунистическую infection; what needs to be done, to have a greater impact on overall mortality, so this is a diagnosis for more early-stage, and so we must provide fine for identification on a massive scale, for all the people who will be asked to it.”
In its proposal opined specialists and government officials of the Council on preventing AIDS in Халиско (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, such as Фабрицио, who asked for the review in a private laboratory, побужденный only those that did his friend and, despite his young age, he has already been on the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой Капоши, раковой tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that will die, and don't want to know.
“Time is still die, the better I will be надираться three times a week,” they say. but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I well питаюсь, do exercise, принимаю drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
“I work, I have a lot of class, I give a tour, an active life of gender, but with shared responsibility, забочусь about themselves and about another person,” listed Фабрицио, who agreed to share their personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to сподвигнуть his statement that those who now, in the context of the World Day to Fight AIDS, is experiencing fear.
Let проверятся if was the risk of contagion, as soon as possible, to find out whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let the kind that can live, like any other man, being responsible.
It is his report summarizes the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms table
Big gap between health programs and the ordinary citizen, believes Ricardo Салазар, a journalist from Гвадалахары, who became a problem associated with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places, on this task, “actually increased distribution of condoms, before we make one or two, we will now offer packages to сотне, and this is a very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now so far has no access to презервативу”, he said.
Among the most vulnerable to the new infections are teenagers.
“Why do they have?” is a popular issue, with ехидством and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, staff аптек and health workers, who do not want to hear teenagers, assured пропагандист.
I propose that the change is inefficient distribution; to condoms were not only for прилавками and to a hundred of them was in автоматах туалетах in public places, which often goes to the young.
This is not encouraging распущенности.
It is not about the payment, beer and мотеля, Governor Эмилио Гонсалес replied, when asked whether it is possible, the distribution of condoms under his leadership.
“It's not sexuality, best to make condoms available to those who are already testing sexual activity,” he said.
The key data in Халиско
Recorded 13,435 (12,158 total cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).
The state takes 4-ranked in the national rankings on the new and the cumulative AIDS cases and 13-e for HIV.
92% of заражений relate to the gender, 6% of the way through the blood and 2% to перинатальному path.
An estimated 50 thousand people can live with HIV, as in one recorded case is from 4 to 5 people, who do not know about it.

Worse still, the Court rejected the document, ousted the government of Mexico in amicus curiae (friend of the role of the Court”), which described the process, which must be within the law of Vitro конкурсных manufacturing, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries, to link it with Article 15 of the US bankruptcy law.

“Гектор Хетин Рейес”: “basketball was my life.”
Заядлый баскетбольный explorer Гектор “Хетин Рейес” was more than 60 years is associated with this sport and, thanks to him, объездил the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico, housed in the minds of so many баскетбольных stories, as “Гектор Хетин Рейес.”
And even before the hemorrhaging in the brain environmental him to a wheelchair in 2008, Рейес was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a small player categories, top player баскетбольной League, уполномоченного and chief BSN with Ковбоями Баямона and president of the Federation of basketball.
“I carried out a lot of roles in баскетболе throughout his life, including several at the same time, as when I was president, BSN, director general of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990's,” recalls Рейес Primera Hora during a visit to his home in Баямон, where he lives with his wife founded Исабель, retaining for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Рейес not exaggerates, making this claim.
The walls of his home, almost all украшенные photos and памятными things, gathered for a long way, attest to this.
In the heart of Баямон
The emotion he protects those who remember his way through Ковбоев, starting in the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when under 15 years of his speech in the role with the agent or agent of the contract.
“This was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because they had the opportunity to be part of eight championships Ковбоев since 1967, as an agent, with the agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I попрощался with one in 1981, the year дебюта Джерома Минси in BSN.
From that moment, and continue to lead a “Куко Ортис”, which was a great administrator,” noted Рейес.
I remember that the genie бартов that направлялся here and was in the University Алабамы (Birmingham), told me: “I have for you, there is a very strong player, the growth of 6'7”.
“Want?”
And this was the beginning of a Минси, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico,.
Бартов then recommended снайпера Raymond гаусса, who received the citizenship and became one of our best бомбардиров.
I remember that said that if Минси brought чемпионство Баямону гаусс, would have helped to win another one.
Чемпионством Ковбоев with гауссом I насладился, but is already at a distance, because to the 1988 already значился boss of the federation.
By the time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Минси in the national team.
Remember how we won for the first time in the US during the olympic квалификационного tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, on which we have received the fourth and it was to be bronze, if not the canadian judge, which has forced us to play the game, said Рейес.
The team with the World Cup 1990-this is the best team, what you ever saw?
It is among the best, as well as the one that won the Team's Dream have in the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite was the one with Панамериканских games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and разбили team of the US, which was quite similar to that which we have бронзу won the World Cup.
In the team not only again played Минси, гаусса, Рамона Риваса, Fico López and “Пикулина” (Ортиса), but also the young (Javier) “Тоньито” колон and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Франсиско and Edgar) and Mario “Quixote, Morales, who could not participate in 90 year because of the trauma of колена.
The team, which, perhaps, was not the best in terms of personal composition, but has brought us the gold medal and great delight, was a team of Olympic квалификационного tournament in 1995 Неукене, Argentina.
With ролевыми players such as “Канито” Ньевеса, Pablo Алисеа and young Роландо Хурруитнера players in return, temporarily estranged for confusion in the championship Панамериканском Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico,?
Without doubt, this was Пикулин Ортис.
His impressive performance in international tournaments.
No one in Puerto Rico, not dominated at this level, as did Пикулин.
And this is without taking into account his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best пуэрториканцем manager?
This is a very complex issue.
We have had a very good молодняк, including Хулио Торо, флора Мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond Далмау, Армандито Islander people.
From the young, I like to work Лео Ариллы.
What you think you his crowning achievement in the federation?
Participation in the Glorious era national team between 1988 and 1998, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in the season.
What you have done?
There were things that I wanted to make, for example, регионализацию smaller categories.
For example, to boys from Понсе played only in their area, and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national плей - офф.
Now guys, travel and play too much, and it unnecessarily.
At least, I see the fruits of a compulsory certification and appreciation for managers, officials and judges.
It delivers me pleasure.
What do you do now?
Most of all I listen music, watch music videos on YouTube, my era наслаждаюсь their grandchildren and occasionally хожу on баскетбольные matches.
And, of course, my wife Иcабель наслаждаюсь society, which has always been with me.

Downhill course, which examines “the end of the world”
Every week, students examine апокалиптические phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombie, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
In this семестре, when religion professor Stuart Шарме decided to read about the end of the world, he knew that располагал неотразимой enticement: the end of “a long return reference” calendar майя, 21 December, for which many people in America as proof that, come the end of the world.
But Шарме had no idea that his anticipated in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Сэнди, financial crisis, which some call “долгоармагеддоном”, and the growing conflict, where втянут Israel, a place where christian theorists believe that the end of the Apocalypse will begin.
“I'm not aware that this will be the most апокалиптический семестр of all,” said Шарме this week students University Рутгерс - Камден (New Jersey).
If you look at what is happening in the world today, as if we were just 30 days, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those апокалиптический way of thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of “the end of the world” in this семестре, theoretically, the latest in history.
In Темпльском адъюнкт - University professor Barry Вакер reads “the media, culture and the end of the world.”
Every week, students examine апокалиптические themes, such as nuclear war, zombie, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We engage, why these ideas with time travel,” he said, and the way that offer some bleary scenarios that cause certain actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, may be war.
This month, the students анализировали films on апокалиптические themes and explored, as they are out of line with examples from real life.
“I tried to tell students that may, perhaps, plausible and it is impossible,” said Вакер.
In the main кампусе Pennsylvania State University professor of the history of Latin America's Мэтью Ресталл and his colleague Солари адъюнкт Amara, a professor of history of art – and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is called simply “the end of the world.”
“We are not добавляем “2012”, to always have the opportunity to read the course once again, if not the end of the world will come,” said Ресталл.
Despite the “неминуемое destruction”, the students must learn to cook, projects and ceding bottom-line examination.
In Penn State итоговый exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that leaves students choice, but as the work of “to the most nights, which presumably will be the end of the world,” said Ресталл.
Rates have proved quite popular.
“The place went for two hours,” said Ресталл about his course for students with high average баллом, on which записались 35 students.
We have received reports on e-mail for many weeks before the Semester from people who asked, is there still a place.
The students, in turn, reassure, that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to see that make people, to console themselves,” said Бриджид Robinson, 23-year-old студентка separation of religion and sociology of Хаддонфилда, New Jersey, in Рутгерс - Камден.
And апокалиптический thought, secular or religious, it is only a question of solace or its absence.
Уилл Векеса, the 25-year-old student of psychology and separate сестринского affairs, said that looked all апокалиптические films.
“I have never heard of the course, which would be taught it,” he noted.
I like it.
But none of the surveyed students — not to mention Professor-not said that believes in the date for the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project affecting майя prophesy, and in some ways we have discredited his,” said Джули Зеглен, 21-year-old студентка last rate in Темпльском University of Уэст - честера.
Майя never predicted the end of the world; and this is the key point in календаре Ресталл, said.
But he noted that there are апокалиптическое concern in western culture, which consists of a few centuries, where people react to the changes around предсказывая, the end of the world.
The Internet has increased the speculation.
“In other places, people don't think about it,” he said.
Англоговорящем predominantly in the world.
Joseph Догерти, a professor of religion at la - Саль, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question about whether, if he knows of any rate, about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not take part in the end of the world,” he wrote, referring to the вышестоящей resort.
We have помилование from the Pope.
Ресталл noted that, for a long time, read about the many days the court, and said that, if nothing happens, 21 December, “people immediately begin to think about the next date” or философствовать that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
The students and teachers blithely belong to that date.
Some have said they intend to go to parties, “the end of the world.”
“Could be, позвоню someone from friends to посмеяться together,” прокомментировала Самира Ford, a 20-year-old graduate студентка ties.
