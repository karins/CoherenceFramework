A Republican strategy to counter Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers it as a myth, stating that voter fraud is rare in the United States the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, the Republican lawyers have identified that 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain : the new provisions negatively affect turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments from 2009 promulgated new laws making it more difficult registration process or vote.
This phenomenon has gained momentum after the November 2010 elections that saw him add 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 projects of laws restricting the right to vote were introduced in 41 states during the single year of 2011.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of advance voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and retire to citizens with a criminal record their vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to put such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsoring bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity card as the card health insurance.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such an ID.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the ID required.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of people over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required ID card with picture.
More.
Students, voters considered voting more for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
By cons, these states allow club members fishing or hunting vote more Republican side use to vote cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have sponsored legislation in 2011 abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, the voter registration campaigns have helped to save about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced by 17% the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 levels.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states to reduce the period of advance voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African American, while they accounted for only 13% of voters in the state.
It was the same with Hispanics.
They accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of people who voted early.
Conversely, whites accounted for 76% of voters represented only 46% of voters voting in advance.
Of course, the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes Democratic Governors.
The Advocate General of the United States intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photo.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democrats denounced the partisan critics of the laws that have been passed and they see a clear goal of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that the states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: the new provisions negatively affect turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly American democratic system.

Screening for prostate cancer : take the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test may present incorrect results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to hesitate more men already reluctant to spend testing.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, this one European, found a difference in mortality between patients who were screened and those who do not have.
This study also demonstrated, with follow-up after 12 years, we have between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if one is not detected.
I recommend the test from 50 years or age 40 if you have a direct relative who has had cancer of the prostate.
The African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once it has detected a cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
So be patient to understand the degree of risk of the cancer, offering the options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect the long-term life, and instead opting in these cases, active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We will suggest them to do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, it accurately determines the criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if it should pass or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool for assessing the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevent disease
There is unfortunately no magic formula to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no one smoked, the rate would increase to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
By cons, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco use remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This hurts a lot to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data : 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer fell by half.
the weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the development of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protection against colon cancer," adds one.
power
The organization also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
In excess, it boosted the risk of being diagnosed with colorectal cancer.
The deli also, and should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, salting or drying can cause the formation of carcinogens.
"These can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," says one.
vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, are inconclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
As one of them noted a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another rather noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking about his concerns and his family history with your doctor.
"Skip a test, it does not give you cancer."

The Higgs boson husked
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has created quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this effect contributes to the Higgs mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, no less.
And then there is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "least worst" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but that has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether this is good Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that there is a genuine new particle, and it resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be completely certain.
Suppose all the same whether it is good Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law must inevitably wanting two things can not be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and do not try too hard, you'll hurt yourself.
But even if the particle physics is a strange world, it turns out she has also a law of this kind : the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens appointed fermions, which obey the Pauli principle wisely.
And the other waving bosons, dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least, not for this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, depending on the site (absolutely amazing, for that matter) The Particle Adventure Laboratories Berkeley mesons, we will not discuss here, and the "force particles" in which the great forces of nature and which spread the Higgs boson would somehow related.
These bosons then, it must be emphasized here, not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is a boson with an extraordinary banality : the photon, or "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone thrown in a pond.
This "fault" is born an electromagnetic wave (light or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc..), And this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, a bosons "bearers of force."
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, the only difference being that this is another field, the Higgs field, which should be "bothered" to this boson appears.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field, to excite, must reach very, very high energy, almost as if it were a frozen pond with only a very could ride the big rock surface.
This is why we have a huge particle accelerator like CERN - The Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km in circumference! - For achieving such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs mass.
It is indeed not all particles or all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, they do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field : those who do have mass, while others (such as the photon, like) have none.
Now, what "can bring" all the research, application Ms. Plamondon?
For science, it is used to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows the physicists to scrutinize any difference between the observations and the predictions of MS.
They are also more fervently hoped that we find, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
The latter, it must be said, still huge gaps, not offering any explanation for gravity (gasp!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oups!).
But we did not find such differences at CERN until now.
implications
The implications of this research in the area of Mr. and Mrs. All- the - World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.
Consider : in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, the revolution does not suspect that their work would trigger.
They foresaw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already said late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and has itself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - starting the laser was rather seen as a "gadget lab."
Imagine...
And applications can also come from all around instrumentation research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not his original intention, is now an "eye" for all digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
This does of course not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...

Palliative Care - The best way to die... | The Gazette
Commission with its die with dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of end of life.
The debate should resume shortly, while a bill is being prepared.
However, in this critical area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir has attempted to take a closer look.
There are only a few weeks, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that had left him gnawing a break of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, half fig half grape, lying in bed at the hospice Victor- Gadbois, Beloeil, where it is happened the day before.
"But it's still a shock, can not be prepared for that," he said.
The disease is at work : a huge weakness that prevents them to the toilet, and even eat alone.
Seated before a delicious lunch, he agrees to be helped to eat, resigned.
Brave, sometimes even to smile, talk to strangers who are working around him, give him his medication, offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that you heal me from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the " team found a remedy for this evil.
"In our lives, we learn that a man, it pisses standing," said Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the house Victor Gadbois.
Decline stage of the child, for some people is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept the decline, he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter hospice Victor- Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They forecast a maximum life of three months.
At this point, the "team of doctors and nurses around them are more lavish care called" curative ".
For Mrs. A., 89 years, the worst fear is to die "conscious and choking."
But the disease has made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no wish in life," she said, before he is asked to accept a mask to help him breathe.
She still expected in the coming days, a last visit to his son from Italy.
At Victor- Gadbois, we lavish, with a group of volunteers, body care and assistance to food.
What is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make life more comfortable death.
In Quebec, there are a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
This is very little when you know that eventually all die one day.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whatever level, physical emotional or spiritual comfort.
In dying, we agree to provide care to mouth brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics are no longer required to control their blood sugar.
And death is part of life.
Last night, we were served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it was his son who finished beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help the relatives and patients alike," said Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
Home Victor- Gadbois, the days are not alike.
Alongside a 93-year- old man who enjoys his last meeting family in the yard, ensconced in his pillows while they toast in his honor, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by her parents, his wife and two young children, having tried everything to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by elderly cancer patients less than 45 years," worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the home of Victor- Gadbois arrive home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say to treatments designed to soothe the pain when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, that either at home, hospital or nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the house Victor Gadbois and Hospice Society of Greater Montreal at home, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in the Quebec health care which threatens several specialized palliative care physicians adopt a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by luminaries palliative care Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, runs to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before we agree to carry out euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spent 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, but we do what is necessary for relief.
I fear that patients do not ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And parallel, many oncologists are attacking their patients until the last day, despite the worst predictions.
Expectations of Hélène Richard survival were minimal when already dropped a grueling chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, she said she regretted that I stop beating me, she said.
But she told me that I " was over!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank the caregivers not having acceded to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Hospice Society of Greater Montreal at home, patients are refractory to treatment against pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, so doctors often use palliative sedation, which returns the patient to sleep until his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient is relieved not be able to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want you euthanasiiez me", it means "I want to be relieved."
The realization of this report was made possible thanks to a grant of Journalism Institutes of Health Research Canada.

Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the roads, the construction contractors, fundraisers political parties and experts of the Italian Mafia every day tell what they know about a great "system", combining the building industry, officials, politicians, unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" which was very expensive to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It 's funny how the system crumbles since we took drastic measures," quips Jacques Duchesneau, a member of Quebec and former head of the Montreal police.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, through a background investigation on embezzlement related to road works contracts in Quebec, where the Liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, n ' had consented only backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" establishes a direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the survey in 2010, he says, the only Department of Transportation would have saved a billion dollars in contracts," some restraining their instincts to reach a share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping she manages to "demonstrate the tricks behind the people."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, are also splint with his army of auditors, investigators and government analysts.
More police officers ' squad Hammer ", which since 2009 have led the" cartel sewage " from Montreal to go easy on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted searches in series and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec City third.
He is suspected of pocketing bribes, kickbacks in exchange for repeated public contracts.
Are also indicted engineers to the road of Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
This caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the commission "system" for obtaining public contracts.
He even paid for years 3% of the value of contracts awarded to Montreal at an intermediate related to the mafia money transferred it to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has sown to the wind in the 2000s, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power.
He also admitted having organized illegal fund-raising for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts in inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former civil engineer, was well detailed to the committee: in ten years, he has received construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes of bribes totaling 736,000 dollars, in exchange for which he swelled sewer cost contracts.
Other officials of the road said they had been made to bribe inflating 30% to 40% of the invoices, false extras.
Then a party organizer Mayor Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Smith of deliberately ignored a parallel budget feeding its coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Smith resigned in early November, Montreal plunging into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the Borough of Rivière-des -Prairies to the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of municipal land bought 5 million and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in the real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation that will finally put in place, she says she "takes on a thread to understand how the system works, infiltrated by ants to stop gangrene and pin the culprits."
The process, she said, is "painful but positive."
We're cleaning the wound but should a true Montreal investigation unit and a watch, not to see him return questionable practices.
As does the housework.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau noted for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials aware of the scheme," when they are not soaked in scheming!
Considering 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips : "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to$ 100 donations to parties but this will not change the situation, he said : "While we do not strictly limit campaign spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates an overhaul of the award of public contracts and financing party system : "We can not go lower, to the bottom of things with courage, will rebuild the house on a firmer footing, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...

"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain the increase?
This can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players arrived.
Every day I rose at their side.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
In everyday life, these push me to raise my level of play
And in game, it's easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I will not burn me.
I started in the center of preforming the INF Clairefontaine on my way to Saint- Etienne, I always advanced in steps.
So you take advantage of the competition set up by Carlo Ancelotti...
Recruits this summer are used to play games at the highest level.
They also know that every workout is crucial.
What makes a guy like me wants to meet and provide maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my position.
He is assisted by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Ancelotti is it the man for the job?
Course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, it has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of Europe's top coaches.
He has extensive experience and has won many titles with posh clubs.
He witnessed great players.
I think he will win more titles to Paris.
In January, I had a discussion with him comforting.
I then went out to a series of injuries.
The confidence in me also explain my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the season PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the leading position.
But nous Embuscade in Reston.
One of our major goals is the Champions League : we qualified for the 8th finals with style.
What is the purpose of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our say against very good teams in Europe.
First we want to finish top of our group in front of Porto, in order to receive during the eighth -final second leg.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in time.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project happen.
In Ligue 1, does not win the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really care to pocket the title of champion.
Last season, it is not gone away.
In May, there were disappointment because we had the quality to finish first.
It was a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, conducted a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media waiting too PSG?
It is normal to expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and the players we have.
We fully accept.
After, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and still found things to be ashamed of, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
It is not FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a game project
A team is built over time.
It has been proved in the Champions League we could meet there.
Watch Manchester City that does not happen, for two seasons, to qualify for the 8th finals, they also made huge expense!
In view of the amount invested, you imagined with a 15-point lead at the break!
It was neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by the new GMP.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be smiling by telling us that despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Good to be told that there is a "Zlatan dependence."
This means Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals.
He came to it and proves he is the star of the Ligue 1.
He demonstrated wherever he went he was a great player, a global star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also meets the men he has around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their game
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to move forward.
How did you feel about the Euro 2012 with France team?
As a disappointment.
I was keen to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatch playing time
I saw things there and I came out stronger.
Today, I can make good games selection.
This is what I expected since my baptism with the Blues.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine and we must today be exemplary.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blues?
It results for him.
It is well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires wins.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to compare.
White had achieved its goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil.
The good draw (1-1) ripped off, October 16, in Spain there is a founder match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before the shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.

With Bitcoin, and sell without paying banks
Just the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fee between stakeholders.
In addition, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable : the belief that the current monetary system is banking monopolies, leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol as BitTorrent, which allows the exchange files peer.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have been recorded with 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to$ 2, five months later before coming back today around ten dollars (courses are listed bitcoincharts.com on site).
Nothing very impressive compared to world trade in real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on virtual currencies issued in October.
It describes bitcoin as "virtual currency with the most success", "compete with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is distinguished from other types of virtual currency such as "credits" used to advance a video game that you win by playing or you can buy (and sometimes share in return).
The social network Facebook has developed such a system.
But each time, a central authority control and process exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both trustees of the ledger, auditors, issuers of money, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses as an e -mail.
Except that a user can select a different address for each payment, ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically by a system of double encryption key.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
With the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoins exchanged actually exist in the book of public accounts, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write the new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge to computers, and the winner of which, a kind of provisional central banker will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hash stage, that is to say processing of a large file into a shorter, unique digital fingerprint.
Computers "are" the new transaction and it add a number before "chop" all.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special footprint (many zeros).
Once this number is reached, the other nodes easily verify that this is correct.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user would pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be approved by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, which leaves room...
The scale of the challenge is raised each increase computing power.
Network life has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and stolen bitcoins in deposits.
"The fault is not used for the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, which just launched Paymium a company payment real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through the anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Of heavyweights like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, such as the platform of WordPress blogs, accept.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and found that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," enthuses Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul which converts bitcoins gold.
Pierre Noizat also authored a book on learning that currency, believes in the potential of this technology as network transactions.
His system Paytunia is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile contactless payment, but Bitcoin uses to validate transactions, thus cheaper.
The carrier operates over its identity and can be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement at merchants that do not need to install new devices or software.
They simply provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," said Pierre Noizat, which claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement questioning of hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to re-evaluate the various risks, today considered high, if successful in this currency.

We left Afghanistan.
And after?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. should follow the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any of us expect.
These are mostly Afghan farmers we punished by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, maimed.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse foreign armed presence, as time the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer when the West will be more discreet.
The departure of the French troops based Nijrab, I observed the top of planted almond French credits through hills, is done in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored joined Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.
There will be no flood Taliban on Kabul at the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country with fire and sword because of fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by the Organization of Al -Qaeda, but the situation has not improved today.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and Taliban current meet in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The principal chiefs of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have evolved into businessmen, government seizing land for resale in the Land returned from Iran and Pakistan refugees benefit " of huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They discredited, most of them have also not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the country, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave as those who took advantage of American largesse : capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They rubbed the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years Kabul now has 5 million, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full of girls as boys.
It will provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opponents are fond of mobile phones, television, and Turkish soap operas that have a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities will be the order they considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle is already concerned with reconstructing provincial militias that escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should enjoy a degree of decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, removing the Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
Karzai does not want foreign control, especially during elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country since the 50s and well before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been re-started, no dam is in condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported, nothing happened, except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure was needed.
The noise was rumored that Afghanistan had immense mineral wealth.
This only adds to the feeling that Westerners n " were there to capture it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site or transportation for export through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) search the immense Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
It will one day also as Afghanistan and Pakistan, which largely depend on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The departure of the French troops fighting ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids : high school girls, boys, Department of French at the University, French Institute, cooperation in military fields, legal, medical and agricultural support Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of matching grants and offensive actions, a service "" civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), removed in 2012, led, and is complete with a French NGO, many works of collective action and agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages interest.
This work, greedy local implementation " of labor, have helped to contain the insurgency irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased arable land.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two billion military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of local, very hard in these valleys often located more than 2000 meters.
The Embassy has received dozens of written small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa requests.
For them to overcome the insurgency by foreign groups, the farmers said they wanted, he would keep them for a small civilian aid, well controlled and that affects them directly.

A Constitution forceps in Egypt
This is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, it temporarily grants full powers, he decided to play his all.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote the final text the next day.
There is just one week, the head of state had granted two more months of this Assembly to finish his work.
For nearly two years that Egypt is based on a provisional text amended several times which weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal complications.
This new initiative has only increased the divide in the country.
To his opponents, President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium" continuing "betray his word" and "trample the law."
The side of his supporters, we are assured that this is a way to get it over with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the process of transition.
A referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to abandon their plans to explain the text, section by section, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute raged throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with Time magazine.
Especially since it uses a precipitate vote is the ultimatum to the Egyptian people : "Either you vote for my text or I keep full powers", they supposedly to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, large Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals were missing.
Mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling not being able to present their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, alternate members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Commentators have also amused that one of the only differences of the day is expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members felt that the pendulum of the constituent was set incorrectly.
The text, which was still in the process of "being voted yesterday evening has 234 articles.
Objects of attention, Article 2 is finally identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stipulates that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi parties, for whom "establishing Islamic law is a major claim, hoping to replace the" principles "with" rules ", which would have allowed a more stringent application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a sign of good will and respect for others elements of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", say the liberals, who see only one shot of communication.
Because according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is through other items.
They aim in particular Article 220, which gives the Al-Azhar University in an advisory role, particularly when it comes to check the conformity of laws with the Sharia.
According to the specialist Egypt Sophie Pommier is worrying because "people called to decide are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. "
Liberal fears are further fueled by the fact that the next president of this university should be less moderate than the current one.
" For now, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the civil state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not scholars but scholars, some trained in the French system " moderates Blouet Alexis, who is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledged " there may be some ambiguity about the Article 220 because the words borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [ Islamic jurisprudence, ed].
And the question may arise in the future to what extent civilian judges are competent to decide on. "
Beyond its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is very critical because of the powers it grants the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that they are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another point of contention : the powers of the army.
Accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defense budget will not be presented to Parliament, but a National Defence Council.
Nor will allowed the trial of civilians in military courts, as requested by the associations of defense of human rights.
The latter are also expressed concerns about the text, they consider draconian.
The offense of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious impact on freedom of expression, the press in particular.
In addition, no item is no longer echo to the protection of women, says Heba Morayef, Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word does not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was speaking last night on TV, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
Supports the Head of State parade them on Saturday.

"That language, Moscow will" Migrant save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists argue about what will give the law on compulsory language test fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already been introduced in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia : Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose : to earn money to help their families stayed at home.
Since December 1st, a law came into effect and states that each worker must pass a Russian.
For the moment, this rule is only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, personal services and retail.
However, over time, promising the federal migration service, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also of the history of Russia and the basis of law.
We'll have to validate their Russian language skills to obtain and renew his work permit.
Are free only nationals of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law.
Earnings, negative attitude and protection of human
The network of test centers will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the State University of Moscow State University of St. Petersburg and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants can take the exams in all cities with more than 160 centers have been opened throughout the country.
The initiative to introduce tests was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the Act comes into force, human rights have already repeatedly asked in the press what it will give?
What is the requirement to know the Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering "of slavery to work."
Many speak of rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service of Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before departure.
Only a system of organized selection will resolve 90% problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without occupation, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, certify Sebelev the migrant future is to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him provide a "journey" in a crowded house where he and dozens of his torment is similar for months without food and paper and must toil 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are mistaken, we take their passports, and they do not affect the expected salary," says the CEO migration services for the work of migration services Tajikistan Tolib Sharipov.
I do not argue, Mr. policeman!
However, many citizens of the republics of Central Asia who wish to make money in Russia trust they do not know not only the language of the country where they want to go, but they write with difficulty in their own language.
This is obviously not their fault, but their misfortune few Turkmen, Uzbek, Tajik can not afford to follow even a fair elementary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children let alone dress properly and equip them for school.
Once they reach adolescence, these young people go to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you do not know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and weakened."
However, defenders of human rights notice an important aspect of the law on the language.
The exams will be used only to migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no review or official work thereafter.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome to enter or defense"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money : between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a false registration quickly for only 1500 rubles.
Russian police know that we have false documents, we do not have registration, where extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea," he told reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Be quick, do not skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of entry into force of the Law on the tongue, it was discovered that the migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Many false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers out of a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing each migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure : it will cost three thousand migrant worker.
Representatives of the government and the defenders of Human Rights agree that short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption to make it impossible to simply buy these "scraps of paper".
Authorities may give migrant workers who could not validate the exam the first time the time to attend language classes.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicate with people.

The Ministry of Interior is not involved in the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Interior Ministry proposes to toughen the law against carrying civilian weapons.
This is the policy response to recent incidents : whether it is for shots at weddings or the massacre organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of arms by rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a permit to carry a weapon in the passing from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma shortly.
Everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw."
An open letter appeared on the Internet in which the authors, representatives of various centers of fire, require abandoning "this senseless cure."
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered gun is minimal, said the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police while 1,168 crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of laws on civilian firearms will not prevent criminals to supply the black market.
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Providers : the factory to the officer
The black market for weapons supplies through multiple channels.
The main channels are five in number, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and at Headquarters.
Capture taken from a site taking Screen Control Arms
The first is "military footprint", that is to say the weapons were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," said Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to police.
Baranets explains that these are the weapons stolen from police stocks as stolen directly to representatives of law enforcement as well.
Illegal guns go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were started deliberately to cover the deficit," said the old soldier.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are for something.
"We see private weapons plants that do not compete with the competition in the international market and flowing weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of black market smuggling.
An important part of pistols and machine guns from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes craft, a mob formed and organized supply," added the former military.
Where are the weapons?
The experts assessed the approximate proportion of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was made in 2011 by the Center for Analysis of problems and study public administration.
Experts have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data portals for weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, just the army and police.
Half of these weapons on the black market is found "for lack of employees whose work is related to weapons," says the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacturing and 5% are from "clandestine excavations."
A seller and looking at a gun who requested anonymity ensures that long ago nobody buys the weapons found by the specialists of the clandestine excavation, they are too old.
Most often, he said, sellers will seek new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys through a teaching unit, eg a TT pistol.
It is her book from the goods by a fence.
"He carries it in the city and sells it for 900 € per unit with two magazines," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, and when crimes are about to be solved, it makes a purchase control with illegal arms dealers," says the seller.
"As a luxury boutique"
The buyer and seller are typically found through knowledge.
I looked at the sites, blogs, until a guy shows and offered me to come to the station Begovaya someone take me to become a "wedge" to haggle.
The price of the gun, it gave me on the spot
Victor Baranets Observateur in Military
To find a gun, I must know someone who has a contact says the seller. I know someone, but I do not trust him.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come in saying, for example "On behalf of such a person, who asked me to send her daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even bought a pair of brass knuckles with a person whom I trust.
It my book only to me because he knows I do not give.
The new look for small arms in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons mid-1990s when it was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
Patterns, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "anything you want."
"I thought I was in a luxury shop," recalls the military.
There is no secret to the buyer says Baranets, you can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy it goes with the seller in the forest and installs a target.
"They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the gun works well, you begin to negotiate," describes the expert.
Shop from the sofa
Search engines display the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses."
To do this, you do not need any document and person to meet.
"Just have a specific amount of money," writes on advertising on the site "Buy a gun or a gun fight."
Users will leave their application and ask questions.
And sell to minors?
"Without a permit, of course," ask the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has issued a vast network of fake sites with shovels and picks people wanting to buy weapons.
People flock to the food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military
I 've heard of this type of patterns : generally, the site is stored outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer shall pay the automatic terminals.
"It gets back a picture and instructions on where is the hidden weapon," said the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that making a request on the website, you can find yourself unarmed and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has issued a vast network of fake sites with shovels and picks people wanting to buy weapons.

A Makarov for$ 100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts say, can cost between$ 100 and$ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov association "Right to a weapon", you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
He came out of long-term storage by the management of the storage medium.
According to official data from the Ministry in relation to the period January- October 2011, the number of these crimes has generally decreased in Russia 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs dropped by 7.8%.

United States : employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets are on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against the low wages paid by Walmart supermarket and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy 's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will grow or falter quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of leftist associations.
With increasing low wages received by employees at Walmart base and the fast food chains, event organizers are seeking the establishment of trade unions.
This sector is currently not covered by the labor movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, "Black Friday", when a wave of rain balances seizing million befell America and sometimes triggering scandals.
That day, some employees of the company Walmart, which employs around the world 2.2 million people have left their job to organize pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the stores of the company whose products are intended for consumers in small and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotgun through car batteries, vacuums, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than the big supermarkets.
This is why many low-paid employees at Walmart are shopping solely on their workplace.
Prices and product choices have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell cheap products especially because of low wages of its employees.
These also complain of poor working conditions, such as lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants events of "Black Friday" asking for a raise, they complained that the prices provided by the company medical insurance had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For the employee base at Walmart affecting$ 9.5 an hour, this is a sum that can not afford.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average wage to$ 12 an hour, it would cost the group 3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferring any salary increases on the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store to return their 46 cents.
They spend in a year only 12.39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart noticed with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and have brought no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" has continued in the stores from 8am till midnight the next day and Walmart sold items over the period 5000 to the second.
Its funds have made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The spokesman of the company Dan Fogleman assured in an interview at the site of left Huffington Post that while "less than five" Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was a "transaction com" among others " from the union organizer.
"Next Client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and involved either Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet implemented), but McDonald's and other good restaurants market.
McDonald 's Announces sell billions of servings and then they do not even give you any sick leave and do not pay you the job you honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage set by federal law and that New York is$ 7.25 an hour.
Fast foods to increase with time, but not an average employee base affect New York$ 8.90 an hour.
Nobody touches less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with that amount in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers working at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income and wanted to stay there for long.
Today I find myself interviewing employees of McDonald's who complain about having to live with that salary and sometimes having to feed their children.
On the other hand, the forum Wall Street Journal there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know with what you feed them.
The demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30 near the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue required the cashiers and cooks fast food are paid at least$ 15 per hour, an increase of more than two once the current minimum wage.
They also sought to ensure the establishment of unions in the sector of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration to obstruct and punish protesters by a union harassment or dismissal.
However, the administration rarely their life easier.
For a union, grab fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
A key is the extraordinary turnover.
They do not agree
Other tumultuous events stood near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the gathering at midday near the McDonald's in Times Square with the participation of several local Democratic policies, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, said: "McDonald 's announces sale of billion servings and then they do not even give you not sick and do not pay you the work you have done honestly!."
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats for including the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio has said that "we must all support the employees of the fast food that they get a fair wage and economic well -being that deserves every New Yorker.
The New York Times characterized the event as the most important sector of the known fast food throughout its history has ever.
But only a few hundred people attended besides not all were employees of fast food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently unclear whether this spark mass movement will be small.

"At the moment, it happens only moderately to fool the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies are used to collect augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was revealed that Google has been the current model at its annual conference in November we learned that Microsoft had asked the patent.
However, it is clear from the interview with the group's director of interactive 3D technologies Microsoft lab Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, as scientists of the company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, by creating virtual spaces open.
- Could you tell us briefly what your research group?
- We work on the interaction between man and machine and trying at the same time to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained yet to pixels on a flat screen and sometimes touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox does not sell today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the gesture control.
- Let us also in the future?
- While the Kinect has made physical interaction, many things are going on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Entering information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change that and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
You have to go out in the computer world as ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.
To do this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more convenient form.
To begin, let's get rid of those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but it is not overrated?
We can not say that this is a panacea : the issue of confidentiality arises because we do not always want to tell others about his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project where we thought gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet gestures, limited.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but a bracelet worn on the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
Now is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example : voice + gesture.
- That is to say?
- For example, how would you ask me to spend this can?
You would with words and gestures.
- I usually just talking.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt depending on what the machine can and can not do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but there is a mutual rapprochement.
I think very soon we will work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good depth resolution and this is very important.
- If one is interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensors, what you do not like in modern cameras?
They lack the resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is the current generation that we base our work on the 3D recognition.
It would obviously be nice to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c / s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In relation to this last point, all current technologies are good enough, it adds work for designers of algorithms.
Keep in mind the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c / s really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond gave the touch sensors regular processing delay between 1 and 100 ĩS, current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how it influences the interaction of man and machine.
I could use a device of this type in my work, but do not need to touch, to have more frames per second.
- But does it not increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a typical sensor field visible.
It is not used to set the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the curve of the camera and see how it could help define locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses in public.
Do not you think that a view of the daily use of technology of augmented reality glasses are one of the platforms with the most opportunities?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone the hands is not practical but here's what I think, the best option would be a plus "transitional" reality that you would from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a very personal device and that is their strength (personal items are the ones you see are the only one) and at the same time their weakness from augmented reality glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with others.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is more accessible than Tony Stark in Iron Man, but also the mere mortal.
There is a problem that the opponents of this idea point the finger there is no tactile sensation!
The hands do not feel anything!
Which answers your group he prepares over this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve image support.
It flawlessly records pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to assign the palpability of these "pictures in the air" such interference led to a more precise point where the ultrasound finger and gives you the feeling rays, currently still low, a breath of air on the fingertips.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, they are also a line of work with prospects.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe he feels it would normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we have not tried yet.
There is still a job down there on which it will take a long time to take pains : how to convince someone who is physically located in a very small space that it works in an almost infinite open space - we work concepts on treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, it happens only moderately to trick the brain, there are still many years of work.
That's what makes working on virtual reality so interesting for researchers : many things are still the absolute state of fertilization.

The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The vanguard St. Petersburg" dedicated to the citizens who find themselves in advance to the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra- selective list has hosted eminent actors of the art scene in St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and have found recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero "Rosbalt" is the extrovert artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, rather bearded man, dressed in red that can cross near the Russian Museum, Summer Garden or at parties and openings plugged.
Tables Kirill Miller always gather crowds, regardless of venue.
It is one of St. Petersburg storytellers fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands a barrel organ and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg because he had matured enough for this difficult role in his life, his philosophy and his bohemian image.
- Kirill, why do you go about the city while red and not yellow or turquoise for example?
- I chose red as specialized fashion in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image creator and society.
Although in society, which is not gray creates aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to begin the discussion.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Palace of Culture Nevsky where my work.
I realized that this was my path.
So the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave of Postgazonevchtchina with those who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya - 10" and then there's been no wave.
I am interested in theater, fashion, music, all kinds except the words.
- And all that was left in your artistic Clinic... - It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of Saint Petersburg, where should meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took took place Pouchkinskaya -10 which housed before the work a musical and artistic club, Bohemian Club, home of the St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born : NOM, Tequila -jazz, I still see Chnour happen with the project "Van Gogh 's Ear."
Chnour and his friends sang songs in easy playback in tight shirts, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer fashionable today.
When the band began to perform live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg not badly animated emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great career began, but his training and basic education, is our home it was received.
Picture "D137" Club "Griboyedov" : these are the impacts of artistic Clinic.
Our employees are left as regulars.
I am a hero of the past century, from the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press was the price "The personalities of our city."
I was appointed "Painter of the Year", and that's when my reign has ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are two different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a current and very high acuity.
I'm having a scheduled "The Russian museum through the clowns ' exposure.
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social, today it hurts and it's scary to be so.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic fall.
I love the grotesque, I grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the full and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can not give her hand, but must rather spit in his face.
And lie will be erased by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of player -organ. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else but me can play.
- But maybe the commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art to be neat, delicate, sweet.
Disintegration of culture is happening.
Before, people were divided into herds, supporters of the bohemian liked one thing, another fool.
Today, everything is divided into micro- communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I 'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, we have to think that you'll like it.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- These are people that threw that come to see, the sexual and social works side.
But the cultural side, 300 people come, 10,000 will not come and ultimately means less management, money, everything decays.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings a collector hooked beside Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables are usually those that painted the end of life.
Today, we often confused ideas.
They say there's spiritual culture, consumer culture.
Consumption is not growing, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- In good culturels experts.
There is this concept : the official culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of good tsars, it was not like that, the czars did not understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg that may be experts, but they are excluded because it takes higher experts properly evaluate these experts and fraieront their way.
Currently, the "rule of taste" which blooms.
Erarta the same, but they differ in that they honestly say they do not take any contemporary art, there are artists who have to find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- Saint Petersburg is the cultural capital there in Moscow more culture, there is a ground for it.
And our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many who are curious to see exhibitions, concerts.
For us, this layer is very thin.
We need to make the art of fashion as was the case at the beginning of last century.

Birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with landowners on board in search of a planet back.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to live our species weightless or on a planet back?
I think there is not much choice.
There are actually two real planets that we can win, if only by assumption.
"This is Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Mute, researcher of the State Astronomical Institute PK Chternberg (Gaich).
If the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500.
We can not live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
There is still a half- century, was conducting experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbit differed in any way from earth varieties.
Then orbited insects, small fruit flies breeding.
In 1979, quail eggs have been sent into space to see how an embryo developed in weightlessness.
Is obtained at the output a chick quite normal.
It is then the problems start.
"The problem is the fact that the chick must find support, it must be put on its feet and start moving," said the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medico- Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.
In finding no support, chicks waved haphazardly.
And after 10 hours, newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
Chicks do not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they died just after Four- days.
"We goggled their eyes twice, and then we left, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," said Vladimir Sychev noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last "miniature ark" biological with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, biosatellite "Bion" will ship as species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats and their fetuses sent into space.
In principle, we discovered nothing supernatural.
"It was still biosatellites and that's the only experience. Should do this kind of research," noted Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it is still unable to make copies directly into space.
This is not an easy task.
Losing their normal environment, the animals are no longer able to fulfill their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not performed for ethical reasons.
But women go into space for the past 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what is most precious to mankind.
Our seagull flew and nobody on Earth could not tell if held after a flight into space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
"Nobody answered this question," said Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired sector rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The child's father, was also a cosmonaut Andrian Nikolayev.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having twice been in orbit and have even worked extra- vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, even very little cosmonauts who had nothing and give birth to offspring in full health after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia, Valeriy Polyakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiation and the creation of an artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory Centre preparation of cosmonauts : mandatory step in preparation for flight.
Here, neutral buoyancy, cosmonauts train for spacewalks.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but still a foreign environment for infants is their true element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this : life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Insofar as the baby moves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb of its mother, it is then easier to get used to the water.
It is logical principle, because from his birth to his first bath, it happens only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," said the swimming instructor infant Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if the child that is born of weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs to gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, pelvic atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
Okay, ignore it by relying on simulators delivery.
Of course you can prepare a birth in a special room, the woman happens to get him out.
"And then?" Valeriy Polyakov request to invite reflection on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If he does not feel the force of gravity, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can not dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for training.
It will simply deprived of basic needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, fully mismatched" provides the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of medico- biological Problems of the Academy of Sciences of Russia, Igor Pestov.
Childbirth in space is still something of theory.
However, over time this will become reality when the Earthlings will visit their shuttles to a distant planet will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.

The head of the SAI (Supreme Audit Institution of Public Finance) said: "the control of the pseudo self-employment (in Czech" Švarc system ") failed because politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has qualified inspectors and quality legislation but is lagging in terms of its application.
This was said Miloslav Kala, Vice -President of the Supreme Audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us," said Kala in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint project of Czech and German control inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice approach "Švarc system" by Petr Necas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls, is it therefore permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in a good way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can not prevent an act of authority to inspect and require compliance with the law"says Kala.
At the meeting of the supervisory committee in the House of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech- German project in which were compared the legislation on public procurement in these two countries.
What was it about exactly?
It is a parallel control we launched there this about two years.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides how to manage public and private markets and a proper follow him practice national legislation.
We've gathered all this and this control procedure is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "tougher and better", however, according to certain parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continually develop rules more detailed but it is necessary to focus on putting together law enforcement.
How this project can it help you practice and that he result for you?
Common control of this type should contribute just that we stopped strive to clarify the law, and improve lower thresholds when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest) to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the thresholds markets, we may not reach that goal.
It could be that this system is so much overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes find many more opportunities if the threshold remained high.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of the public procurement legislation.
How does the control system in Germany?
Is there a similar institution in our SAI or a different mode of organization?
Regarding institutions, similarly to the ISC works there the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a board made up a little differently, but basically these two institutions shall similarly.
Skills are also, to some extent, similar, but with a shade over our system of Germany is a federal structure, so it has also over the accounts of this type in the various states.
OHR can only control the federal money, which is home to the resources of the state.
Public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities, there are monitored for current accounts of the Länder.
With regard to national legislation, it is simpler than ours?
I would not make a general comparison without evidence, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but we surely can not say that it will do better in all areas.
This may be because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have comparative data.
However, we must also say that this country we consider a model also faces a series of problems.
Otherwise there would be no advantage to cooperate with our institution, right?
As regards the national legislation has meant to you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already being felt they?
This amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not impact on our operations control.
As we back-testing, it takes a certain delay.
Our observations concern only for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new tool to "identify risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened nearly 14,000 public procurement - where these changes will of course feel, because the thresholds were changed and the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm.
The problem that can occur is that these rules become tougher and it is not possible to comply.
Already under the previous regulations, the provider (eg the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) controlled forced to accept that any breach of procurement law means a breach of budgetary discipline issues.
Is it really useful to toughen legislation in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who commit formal errors without affecting the decision-making process.
Such a system will place more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out?
Look to where we will not.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother with entrepreneurs controls the so-called system Švarc - what does it mean?
The Švarc system be prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in a good way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can not prevent an act of authority to inspect and require compliance with the law.
He can say, "We will change the law and allow" but he can not say that we will act as if nothing happened.
The procurement law has relatively strict rules on formalities and that, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is missing here.

The roads are frozen in places, but most are passable.
In some areas of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snow.
The network, however, remains largely feasible in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were passable this morning, but also frozen and snowy places.
Temperatures dropped and range between -5 ° and -10 ° C but should rise slightly in the day.
The snow stopped in the area and it is in the plains a thin layer of snow.
The ridges of the Ore Mountains (Krušné hory) are however covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to data of the regional road maintenance that because of fog, visibility was reduced in places service.
The fast track R6 and roads in the region are now passable without difficulties.
However, vigilance is still in development, for example on certain bridges which the coating can be frozen and slippery.
All county roads and the third category, including mountain roads are passable.
There are still some of their sections of the remaining snow and frost in places packed with traffic.
Especially in upland areas, drivers should increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways reported on its website that some roads Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers packed with traffic can be on roads in mountainous areas and located in altitude.
The road maintenance services warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region at higher altitudes.
There may be sleet around Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and mainly on county roads and third category.
The I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy roads have been chemically treated.
The snow is mostly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) Mountains and the Eagle (Eagle Mountains).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of packed snow traffic is present on the roads in the upland areas.
In Bohemia, the time is now dry, mostly clear, with potential clouds.
It will blow a little wind and temperatures generally oscillate between -3 ° and ± 1 ° C.
Pilsen
The roads of the Pilsen Region is now passable, although in places it should exercise increased vigilance and adapt their driving to weather conditions.
It's freezing this morning, temperatures range between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and cooling that followed, some channels of communication can be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, visibility is however gradually improve.
This is what it appears from the information of the regional road maintenance service.
D5 motorway is feasible almost without difficulties, however, the maintenance of road communications services recommends increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The lining of most roads are dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the district of Pilsen -South and in the district of Tachov.
Departmental system and the third category are wet and in this case applies the warning against the frozen sections.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially that of the less frequented roads in the region of Šumava.
Olomouc Region
Drivers traveling to areas of the Olomouc region at higher altitudes must now reckon with a thick layer of soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the collar says "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical processing operations.
Snowfall forced the night the road maintenance staff to go on the ground; depending on the services in charge of the road, he fell more than three centimeters in the district Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulties.
" On the heights District Šumperk are remnants of snow.
Drivers traveling eastbound Jeseník should expect to meet the collar says "Červenohorské sedlo" a layer of thick, soft snow, "said CTK today the chief of road maintenance district Šumperk.
Colleagues District Jeseník have also visited the site during the night, according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now bare and wet, even in the higher areas.
In the district of Olomouc roads are passable without difficulties, in the district of Sternberg drivers should be careful, however, in the sections in the forest areas remained wet pavement.
Ústí nad Labem regions and Liberec
As of this morning, the road maintenance services of North Bohemia reported more difficult sections.
According to data from the police, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku closed.
Temperatures will remain below freezing in lower altitude, so snow and ice should keep on the road. In the plains, especially in the south east of the central plateau of Bohemia, there is, however, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No difficulty of movement have been reported yet.
Services road maintenance have reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal night for its formation : rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and freezing overnight.
It is also reported from the main roads, difficult conditions on the road 13 to the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
Closing movement between Telnice Knínice and is due to tree branches that are bent under the weight of snow until it reaches the floor.

Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is one of those alarming news, the kind of pitfalls that we love fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh more and say that we are the only group capable of collecting is a positive energy to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you climb in December a project quite unique : three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you provide more detail this project to our readers?
It is a charity that we prepare for the past two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 am.
Eve, 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
Will terminate when virtually the Mayan calendar will end on the island of Kiribati is located in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead compared to us.
Who had this idea?
Initially I think it was my idea, then we all designed with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together with the public to reflect on the state of the world we leave our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T- shirts, bags, and original against the end of the world key, buying online at www.e - tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap the group with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world is called "End of the world canceled" (in Czech "Konec Sveta zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will hear it also does in these charity concerts?
Of course, at the very end, finally, if we are successful and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The hymns also join at some point in the context of a live show, very unique, the Czech television time.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sings too...
How did you come to work with them?
We work with other personalities from Czech showbiz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charity events...
We strive to engage intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses.
What will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training center Studeo that is accessible to disabled people and we work to achieve within the institute Jedlička with the Tap Association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit with students of the institute Jedličkův and provide activities that interest and amuse.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička, we will transfer the project into a new separate building.
Several bands and performers will take the stage at each concert?
What criteria have you selected?
We tried to develop a program that caters to all ages, including children.
For example, in Prague, take the stage Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Prepare yourself also to other "mega events" like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring, again, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, until you've played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is still a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it looks at first.
We have five members whose electric wheelchair vehicles must travel in the hold, of course we also trimbalons lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything is more or less always gone well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Through traveling abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for disabled people, the attitude of the public towards people with disabilities and thus on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that is all that is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very accessible to people with disabilities out there, it is not even aware that a person moves only in electric chair in the center of the city.
They still do not consider as evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift.
Fortunately, there also an association seeking to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What do we still catch up with the developed countries?
There are many things for which we are still behind...
It is important to note that the improvements and enhancements always depend on the efforts of those involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces, they can go to the bathroom at the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that many people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are quite the contrary to the cutting edge!
Public respect and ease of access is one thing, but things really begin to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians and famous lawyers.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular back back a few years, what led you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And as I myself am a musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And over time, as our moderator said Lada Angelovič was a bit lost control of the situation (laughs).
Success came in the course of recent years, if I 'm not mistaken?
It is true, the fact of creating links with famous singers and actively work to promote the group helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if there were not in the background.
Thanks to grants from the European Union, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential for change.
Show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In a way, this makes sense : all that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts longer.
Few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural...
But pity is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, we have to take pity.
These are people who can live a life full and thrive, having provided the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something, it is not only a breakthrough for themselves but for the whole society.
Is that your success is also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap The group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
Impossible de traduire votre requête de la langue source (zoulou) vers la langue cible (anglais).
We are an open group, people come and go, we can do nothing.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
It will happen the day before the scheduled end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9:00 p.m..
This action will take place in Prague in the arena Incheba, Fleda in Brno and Ostrava Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
By late evening, the three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when the song will be sung together of The Tap Tap "End of the world canceled."
The aim of the concert is to collect funds (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the training center which is multifunctional Studeo in Prague Institute Jedlička.
The price of a concert ticket is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years, the sale of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.

Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers from the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the Agency, it is a member of the former Eastern bloc (the Republic the second State Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with the ESA in 1994 and over the ensuing years has participated in a number of projects of the agency.
However, the road from Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, the Polish fans working on space flight, they are not always met with understanding.
I would like to mention for example the conference A. Sternfeld at the Astronomical Observatory of Warsaw, December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas from the work of avant-garde "Introduction to astronautics."
The development of this young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience cold and years later Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Sternfeld obtained in France the Robert Esnault- Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to astronautics."
Said Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of astronautics world famous contribution was especially rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
In 1925 Poland was built in a handcar to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately we know neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear whether the rocket was intended to propel or stop the speeder.
The only information known about this speeder is from the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with teachers and Mieczyslaw Wolfke Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
According to the documents kept this research had reached the trial stage.
Of course, with the arrival of German armies, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a rocket hunting photoelectric, designed by the engineer Rohozinski, appeared in the trade press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba Lotnicza" an author named Leliwy - Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were aimed military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects using the technique rockets were led by interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo - Naukowy"), who coordinated all the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, other work on the aircraft were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it comes to a company in the November 1954 Issue newspaper, in which there are four more detailed articles on aviation.
In one of these articles, written by professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautics
At that time, projects of artificial satellites have already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research has potential.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) exerted efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice- president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters length was 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Thereafter was built an improved version, RM- 1A, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage rocket RM- 2 were initiated in the desert Bledov.
The rocket had a length of 1.4 meters and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should be able to make real scientific work - the rocket RM- 34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and used to observe the winds aloft.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor- 1 rocket development during the period 1962 to 1965, succeeded the first rockets type RM.
The rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor- 1A, 1B and 1C) were developed, they were distinguished by the size of the space reserved for scientific tools.
Meteor rocket -1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 liter, while Meteor- 1B in this volume was 0.34 liter and Meteor -1C 0.62 liter.
The maximum range of these gear types was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor- 2 rockets were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor rocket -2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Thereafter were built Meteor -2H and Meteor -3 versions.
It should also be mentioned the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Under the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on artificial Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non -Soviet cosmonaut program.

The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public works.
This raised in a lively public discussion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a wider perspective.
Economic systems oriented liberalism, both in the EU in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of greater economic competition unregulated.
This effectively means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This follows from the principle of free trade and free movement (without limitation) the private capital combined with an unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labor (wages) generate pressure on prices.
Should be put under this term the following meanings: a producer strives imported goods sold at low cost to resist the economic competition "making it more expensive" price of the competitor, in order to remove greater market share and increase its own profits.
On a larger scale, this means for most entrepreneurs is to transfer production abroad, or buy cheap or disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Given that private capital has no responsibility for the social point of view and thereby of responsibility towards it generates unemployment, payroll taxes are going up necessarily.
All this intensifies the perfect unwillingness gentlemen contractors to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage to the whole of society by the pursuit of profit.
This is such a point of common knowledge that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistics.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital across economies create a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own people in order to bring home the foreign capital.
In other words, governments are their own people to thank you private capital regardless of social collapse.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments of laws.
The objective is to economically coerce its own population to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs in part by a system of economic constraints if long-term unemployment and secondly by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labor law.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are many years of public distribution points for food for the poor who can not support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions the number of people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common that employees receive such salaries as the state is forced to pay extra for them to reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal for example, was updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economy almost all the southern Member States of the EU measures generate no doubt a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or get by on poverty wages, in the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital to invest in their country.
Here we must ask the question: where will this capital?
If it comes from other EU countries, while poverty will increase from one country to another and this capital can not come either, and then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, to get tired, that the State can not make capital investments in its own economy, which led to an economic catastrophe led economy.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the state can not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
The question then is whether the private capital does not influence, and even does not run today, according to his own selfish interests, politics and the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is a virtually all-powerful and present in all states lobby.
This results in a desperate situation manifested in the area of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefit, in legislation, where everything is wrong but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws for law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All the power does not come from people, as the state constitutions of Western type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that the oriented liberal democracies now see quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": " The State had long been in decaying and functions were assigned by the violence.
The blows of bribes, kickbacks, favors illegally obtained, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
Under-the - table corruption proliferate without limits and the people went to the election with the votes already sold "......" Honest people do trying to get any of the functions, the result once State remained eight months without consuls ".... ' We really started to say that the remedy to this predicament was an autocracy and had to choose an energetic"... It is true qu'Appianos Pompey had in mind, but it is Caesar who transformed irreversibly democracy absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, modern society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In essence, the private capital is no longer able to understand and advance the interests of society as a whole.
The result, now as before, a decline unprecedented elites, without any effort to make reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalizing unscrupulous economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current situation, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies as a sort of pause before the next step.
The fact that the current elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future casualties, humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today and crimes against humanity as we know by ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both international and European internal level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic effect.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms under which strengthen capital investment by the State in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the company for the benefit of State.

ISRAEL : Laboratoire du chaos.
"Nothing ever comes from violence and never will," said Sting in the song titled Fragile whose main line of the chorus is "Do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my son did not want wars, there would not have", said Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest round of violence between Israel and Gaza, as usual, many reactions are high.
Some take Israel's side, arguing his right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs Palestine and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim in his recurring waves of killings, after all, the current residents of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a perspective located "behind the curtain" on the one who benefits mainly tensions that persist for more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a tiny country in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others emerge from my own understanding of it, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the story of a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individuals acted independently or if they were accountable to the throne to someone who ran their actions based on pre-defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time where the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and the concentration causing some financial powers could not be done in a single generation.
Among families with an astronomical wealth is particularly distinguished the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not rule).
Little is written about them.
Course.
By the 90s of the nineteenth century, they acquired the first global news agency (Reuters) to end linkages between their name and serious crime for which they were involved and had always meant to them strengthening their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They have major interests in almost most of the central banks of the world and prepare for or conduct wars against countries in which they have not yet such investments (before the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq five, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4 meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Bank of America Rothschild status central bank began to issue during the civil war his own money (Government, I mean good) and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to radiate own money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, Deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to file a lawsuit against the Fed to have triggered the Great Depression of 1929.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859-1871 in the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated the 33rd degree is the highest level.
The first war was to eliminate large state monarchies of Europe, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially British, and the third is expected to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such amount slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single world religion (ecumenism being nothing more than the beginning of such a solution) and, ultimately, gain absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds is to create a crisis and then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the chaos following order).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed intended to prevent are not repeated crises like those that they produced in 1907).
After successfully trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg Austro- Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia, causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly by a German capitulation military and economic justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Czarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria -Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier start of the second world war, the bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict : they, on the one hand, imposed on Germany staggering war reparations and generating the conditions for radicalization impoverished masses (then it only need to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing to the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, secondly, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was to play the role (she actually held) fifth column to set fire to the powder and start a war.
At the end of the nineteenth century, Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration above laid the groundwork for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed by both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had originally held, or if all he did was planned, however, is the fact that the suffering of the Jews Europe in concentration camps created the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state in the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 in the same way that war reparations imposed on Germany were the cause of the Second World War, the founding of the State of Israel has lit a fire can cause fire a third world war.
If the international bankers are able to trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the Arab or Muslim population generally in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but internationally (just to see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, where one wrong begets another mistake in a circle of endless violence and where we find the source of all the greed of some individuals and their desire to gain power over the world?
Here we must distinguish between ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because at home, the international bankers will offer people the election that their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical fascist politician, loyal towards international bankers, who did everything to start a war with Iran, which could, due to the country's accession to the Shanghai cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) to expand into a global conflict because Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 20% of all the world's oil (which has a naval corridor width than 2 miles) and cause destruction of the global economy.
In what light now appear the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 : "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people accept the new world order."
In their idea, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn sees implant at birth chip making him a being completely controlled.
" They forced all people, young and old, rich and poor, free and slave to wear on the hand or forehead a mark with a hot iron, so that he can buy or sell who does not have the name of the beast or the number of his name.
We must understand that he who has good sense in the figures in this beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six. "

The film Argo: when everything is at its worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protesters composed of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They should be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the Revolution, fled to the United States, who supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not provide the positive outcome American administration, she could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not able to secure the release of hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, suddenly exacerbated later by the fiasco of the attempted rescue of hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their plight aroused the United States a wave of solidarity and anti -Iranian sentiment.
Iranian debacle contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan for president in 1980.
The film Argo, actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory for America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they met in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through incredible coverage : they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew came to scout locations for the filming of an epic sci-fi show.
Combining genres
The plan exfiltration expert Tony Mendez sought the Hollywood collaboration.
To make the story more credible, specialized magazines did state this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictitious company was producing real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The film Affleck is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a unit of a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful hit, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
Moods succeed : sequences Tehran documentary style (in subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events and how, through these photos, these situations were transcribed in the film, there are no major differences)
lighter Hollywood passages, treated with irony and a bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck was able to restart his career in a remarkable manner.
On ridiculed actor, he became a respected stage director and his acting has ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
This is also the first film that Affleck does not take place in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films over Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates the sense of the atmosphere in which the role of Argo Tehran "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of facts, the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive for its clarity also suggests confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a place given, reads a page of history.
Affleck and his staff get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake film crew in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many shares too many places
The director had to settle for a subject offering in that little exciting scenes in cinematic sense.
He's doing well, he sometimes adds some elements of reality and then the result is not always so stylish (the scene in which the threat of attack at Tehran airport is spread through a phone call America and continued on the runway are pretty far-fetched).
The weakness lies in its Argo dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as co Hollywood, their characters deserved more space and they are not far from it, only in this case.
Affleck 's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he allows himself to do with a moderate interest in achieving and enjoying retro 70s style.
It leads the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, somehow, unfinished to this day, and as an example of exaggerated character of the representation of intelligence as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the job.

Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
Www.bankovnipoplatky.com the server, leading a public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges every year, decided now to launch the contest rules or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU is considering lately to adopt a quota of 40 percent women in the management of large European companies was behind our decision," said the newspaper for Právo organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned ago, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, however, women were advantaged in terms of rates of life insurance because they are objectively less risk for insurance companies.
People can point to the end of any idea as amazing as "the workshop of the EU."
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
Among the controversial regulations of the EU is, for example, the requirement to add components to bio fuels, which has negative consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of hazardous substance or the Directive on the size of cages hens amount, which resulted in an increase in egg prices.
Criticism has also been made in the past against the ban is to use the term "butter spread" or withdrawal from sale of conventional bulbs.
The quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The EU administration reacts often under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (the Czech Republic and currently imposes the demands of its banks threatening to use veto).
The interests of pressure groups are, for example, the origin of the fact that in the EU, bananas should not be smaller than 14 cm or present an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission is defended by arguing that she did that harmonizing inhomogeneous national standards complicated trade.
Standards for fruits and vegetables were relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that the existing guidelines are a waste of food.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey to EU regulation last year that must appear on the balloons a warning that children under 8 years old should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU refers to a U.S. survey that balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years in terms of blow trumpets fair.
We too were strange ideas.
The following rule for EU officials themselves is quite absurd because of the sensitivity of this issue for Greece, anyone holding an official position within the EU can not use the name "Macedonia" and shall, instead, talk to FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" combining liberal economists Bankovnípoplatky.com the server named in the investigation, in addition to some nonsense mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU has set maximum amounts for food reserves can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU membership.
The Czech Republic then passed, for example, the volumes for canned mushrooms and risked, hence a heavy fine.
The organizers of this investigation have expressed interest in the idea of paying money to some countries because they have no access to the sea and the idea of a grant request for the granting of subsidies.
These ideas are not, however, originate in Brussels but Prague.
" The fact of not having a sea hinders us.
We will ask the European Union a refund So said. " In the fall of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture at the time Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state found itself with solid stocks that he had then export.
According Palas, the EU would have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Ultimately, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without sea access.
Subsidies for obtaining grants were offered to public by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Nemec (US- DEU), they were, in effect, be used to write applications for subsidies from Brussels.
The EU says "bizarre regulations are rare."
If regulations often lead to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the efforts of the EU in regulating and improving the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of development general rather deserve praise.
Worse, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but were imposed by Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other EU countries, fighting in Brussels for the right to use specific names to these traditional products (which she did not fight fate always win) arouses strong emotions in Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" to which the appellation "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace the name "Tuzemák".
Only products containing alcohol cane sugar, not based on sugar beet, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products from the EU, there is today with world famous cheeses such as feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham, biscuits Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp Pohořelice and Trebon ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and Žatec hops ("Žatecký chmel").
The spice bread Pardubice ("Pardubický Pernik") and cakes called "Cones Hořice" ("Hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their CTM.

People want me to save the Republic, but I'm only an amateur, declares Senator Okamura
Senator, how was the idea of the presidential elections?
This is not a senator or president to me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would be nowhere candidate.
But I can not stand to see how the country is being plundered from the last twenty years, the thieves are not under lock and taxes and the age of retirement increases.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that does not please me, so I try to find a solution to change that.
And as I have over forty years and I am independent member of any party, I have no other options to influence the situation to me in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate, but you have put quickly on his way to the Castle (translator's note : the seat of the Presidency).
Is that so you do not turn your back on those who elected you?
I always said that I will launch in the battle for the castle according to the results of the senatorial elections
Thereafter, I said that if I was elected senator, I present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is an instrument for me to realize my vision.
This is why I need the influence of the largest and broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we Ralons at the bar or in front of our television set, but also that we trample all those who try to bring about change.
Added to this is the release that breaks the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
It has, for example, said about me that I bribed journalists and I was adviser Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You started the battle for Castle with as workhorse themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive beyond twenty million [ CZK ] tax returns.
You need to change the law that purpose.
As president, you do not have such power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How do you solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for the tourist guide activities constitute a profession, I succeeded.
The problem is politics : when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I have a lot more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters of each party to what is best for our country and the implementation.
You consider yourself more as a man of the right or left?
On the Czech point of view, I feel that people would rather put me on the left.
For me, this is a little to the left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is that people are not left or right but to bring people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act just as impartially against bad ideas.
Are you enraged when someone tells you that you are a populist?
But what you said does he prove it?
When developing a business plan in a business, you also have a great purpose and vision.
You try to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all proposals of which I speak have been implemented around the world and recognized experts have spoken.
But without the support of the parliament, it remains that slogans.
You will not survive long in politics with it.
Do you think if you see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, impose material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to join my camp to impose.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they do not want.
When there is a strong personality who identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, it was achieved through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, bluntly, an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just get into politics and I try to get the majority support for my program.
I try, alone, to get things done, and if that does not work, I'll stop at six years old and I go back to the private sector.
It is almost as if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know one person can not make a difference, so I went to a number of individuals to ask them to stand as the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which revealed the fraud oil.
I introduced myself because people are really upset but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of people did not vote and that did have, for the most part, given voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, there are only two independent.
People elected Senate would be difficult to impose changes.
However, I will fight for my vision, eg direct election of mayors and regional prefects.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I do not have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and I do not have the financial means.
I do not have no more money for my presidential campaign, I 'm only twenty miles in my account "transparent".
You do not have the money?
You talk about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I was in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and Škoda Superb worth a few million and 1 million in my account.
Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin because it was a childhood dream : I have always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You ride in an Aston Martin, you have a wealth worth 60 million and you do not have money for your campaign?
Want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your own money?
This is not very convincing.
I do not have$ 15 million for the campaign.
I should go into debt?
I've invested 2 million and a half in the countryside.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not of great interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay the campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by the compensation I receive as a senator.
But I could not live in, such as paying the English school of my son who is 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to make money, I will not take me to any election.
You will continue your business in order to live?
Had you not said that you would put your business on mute?
But this is not related to the amount of such compensation.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will spring the direction of travel.
People want me to be a Samaritan who saved the Republic.
Yet it must be that I live for something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I still earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You can find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Prava.

Architects firm MVRDV show that real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. For proof, just take a look Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly erected - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig a pass on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer in a nearby large company, said: "Yes, it is actually very nice, the building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone Internet, iPad and e -books.
Today, no one will voluntarily in one of those cheesy libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing appealing on the outskirts of Rotterdam, holds a rather special record.
The town of 80,000 souls displays the lowest Dutch education rates.
To give some neurons in brains, the city decided a few years ago, contributing to the general culture and reproduce the seven bridges shadow appearing on the euro banknotes in the form of cute little miniatures painted concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive was limited.
Thus, the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to regain control of the statistics : construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the architectural firm MVRDV of Rotterdam, master diagrams sticks bold and creative buildings witty and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual composure and stood in the competition in 2003 with five books under arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury is still watched, confused and shrugging, Maas, the cheeky, piled his books to choose by size into a pyramid, and ended his speech activists arguments supported by : "expensive town!"
Here it is, my proposal for the mountain of books Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung from earth.
The building is part of a revitalization project also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 rooms.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL in 2012."
In addition, the project has been selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Thus this small dull town, which until now had nothing more to offer than postmodern pedestrian area and town hall a breathtaking ugliness, whose white facades invite to think that they home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first public building of its cultural history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado Book in bell cheese.
Certainly, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joy of reading and architecture open to you when you crush the building floor to explore its topography.
The entirely of glass interior is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lamps talk unequivocal language of municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It already looks around the benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play the ball.
And all books, books and more books.
"Normally, the bookshelves are located along the front and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the traditional spatial configuration and open spaces play inside outward.
Inside the mountain of books was skillfully arranged : in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, chess club, the center for environmental and technical center building.
Particular beauty lies in the Black Library rays, which are sometimes paneling, railings sometimes, sometimes banisters.
A new experience for the sight, touch and smell.
Even architects and building engineers do not want hardened unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, project leader from the town of Spijkenisse, in response to the Standard.
So one day we found a Friesian farm ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, for years the synthetic membrane as a millimeter thick substrate is used in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for a season or two, then you can throw it away.
For the library, the membrane has been compressed for the first time in such amounts, in slabs having a thickness of four inches.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, whose odor evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but especially help maintain the ideal humidity level of the air in the literary mountain.
Gifts for new soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, the building is a model project in ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun illuminates only a short time inside, even the weather is nice.
Thick wooden beams mounted askew with respect to the front glass used visor intercepting most of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very nice.
The fully automated blinds do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, septic computer above, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even Boekenberg described as "the soul finally found" Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, in fact, during the inauguration, every citizen was asked to donate a book from his personal library.
This helped to fill the gaps in the library that was not completely filled (now it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
Rays overflowing everywhere.
For the architect Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a library half empty."
"I think our invitation created a certain relationship between the citizen and the new building.
Everyone knows that the book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration. "
Thus MVRDV has reached the master discipline called in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."
Spijkenisse wrote a new page in literary history.
Even though it may look young and poorly educated.
There is finally a new starting point for the birth of an identity.

Szabo : "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany has opted for abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle : At the beginning of the week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request to obtain observer state to the United Nations.
But then chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support either the U.S. position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany had also opted for abstention in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Germany she finds it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is currently reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy as it defined by the Americans and establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore face several fronts.
We expect them to play a more independent role, but they are not used to.
I think they still groping to find what role, but on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
Then that effectively means the end of "normal" foreign policy for the Germans?
It shows a willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relationship with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers, which is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests do they have influenced the position of Germany vis-à -vis the conflict in the Middle East and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany first significant opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin should take care not to offend public opinion, but also the elites in Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a key factor.
However, I would not give it too much because it is not exclusively one-sided relationship.
But this is in any case a key element in German strategic thinking.
Germany prejudiced in its relations with the United States choosing abstention during important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That's why I think the divide is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Perhaps that Germany will be more than satisfied.
Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it should be taken seriously as a global player and its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
For cons, the United States announced their veto in a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and most European countries?
There have always been differences because of U.S. domestic politics.
I think the Obama Administration is secretly showed great understanding for the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government can of course not publicly defend his position.
I think the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm Policy Netanyahu.
Germany she finds it difficult to reconcile his close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, the position of the major European partners, on the other hand?
I think it does not make things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a consistent and uniform European policy, but today this is not the case.
They therefore can not register within a broader political line and must affirm their singular position.
This is what they are currently in the question of the euro.
I think Germany will take in the future as a driving force and push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not easy for Germany, particularly because of relations with Israel.
This issue has always been tricky.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they must play a greater role marks their independence.
Germany sees it play a role player on the international stage, Germany she just wants to play a key role?
Or was it always difficult to assume leadership roles?
Germany are still not used to this it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look, for example, the euro crisis, we see that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It does not make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it's always the same problem : we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate than the U.S. position.
She must deal with neighbors and varied opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy that decrease, but at the moment, the EU does not fill the void, then who is he?
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
And even if you do not like them, even if it is unpleasant to them and they are less appreciated, that's life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institution in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America together analyze the challenges of transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specialized in German politics, U.S. foreign policy and transatlantic relations.

"Brand Protection" in China when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Ralph Lauren are known worldwide brands.
Armani Polo... what is it really?
Behind this name hides a brand officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand enjoys protection as the company that bears the name can not complain.
And even if it could, it is not sure she would get succeed.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of property rights in the Far East.
Each week a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few extra letters to record their brands.
So instead of Gucci, is recorded Mon- Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada is recorded Kny.
German companies are also legally copy, like Puma, manufacturer of sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook in which there are recordings made with the trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company has registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls which sell almost as counterfeit.
However Pattloch cases are different: its constituents the task of addressing the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai" of parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
With this term are designated women who marry rich men.
Chinese authorities say they have done nothing wrong.
"It's bad for business, we must fight against this trend," requires Pattloch.
"The brand is watered, the singularity disappears, damage to reputation are huge."
Financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to the expensive flagship products.
According to data from the company's market analysis CLSA, China represents an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third largest market for luxury goods and the one that grows the fastest.
However, it is not easy to write off doubtful records Register of Trademarks and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reported trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long time, criticized the name had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not luck, it may even be forced to pay money to plagiarism, because it would hurt its brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases also involve graphics.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use a symbol that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the logger Volvo, used before a blue and white logo that was reminiscent of BMW. The dispute was settled and Geely had to change.
Lacoste fashion house had lost against plagiarists Hong Kong and Singapore, which had shifted the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The Trademark Office CTMO Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have happened last year of an "emergency situation in the workflow to normality restored."
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have declined 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, representing an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures are still pending at the office.
Acting expensive
As often happens in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark registration, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, it is a record and this means that China is the tenth consecutive top rankings for the number of new deposits in the world.
This also would apply to the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office had recorded 1.8 billion yuan fee.
In other words, each record has reported an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
A legal battle cost more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the company is fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
While the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, the imitator has been able to maintain its rights to the Freudenberg Chinese brand.
"It's our fault, because family names can not be protected in Germany," said Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had dismissed the objection of Munich.
Freudenberg has certainly succeeded with two instances, but the other party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of judges.
However, he added : "The process is long, hard and costing us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The Archives has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros six figures" to resolve the dispute.
"This is what we see what it means for us," said Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East are even threatening to spill into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators of the region ensured the use of non- registered trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit in the name of Germany Freudenberg for a production company and shoe leather.
The company had long since abandoned this area, but she could still prevent the deposition.
Wentzler added : "vigilance is required."
Pattloch him and advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "save as everything in China is likely to be protected" as Wentzler said.
Otherwise, the costs can be much greater than the recording.
While Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as explained Wentzler.
Or we lose our place in the market segment in question.

World Day against AIDS : stomp, sing, help
The choir repeats Imbongi Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans in Swaziland welcome their arrival.
This is the story of a relationship that spans more than a distance of 8.733 kilometers.
First, we stomp : cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for women and moccasins for men seeking the pace of the foot hitting the ground. Very soon they find.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers are growing slowly - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they win, bewitch and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor of 29 years almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with a wild gesture of flexibility.
It's Monday evening, the choir repeated Imbongi a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology at Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years came, the geneticist in human medicine man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, every singer has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help themselves
UNAIDS, the UN program to fight against AIDS, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, over 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa."
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This sum guarantees children money for school, a school uniform and a hot meal daily at the center galore.
Imbongi in Zulu means "storyteller" or even "praise singer".
Nobody can become fluent in the Bantu language in this region, but all can sing.
For nearly 10 years, the choir repeated songs in the foreign language that has led Germany to now go to his native region : Southern Africa.
Because at 8.733 km as the crow flies of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni the village depends on the vocal power of German choir.
40% of people with
The village has about 2,000 people, some live in small huts with straw or earth and the majority of them are children.
Over 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents.
At Esitjeni can be observed on a smaller scale what ails Swaziland : the infection rate the highest HIV and the hope of the lowest life in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population is almost never accept male circumcision, a measure which, however, guarantee a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in spring 2005, the choir had discovered the village. The Imbongis have mostly seen many children in the street that he lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without educational qualifications, there is simply no perspective.
At first it was only a few people who personally pledged to pay a few dollars each year in order to send a child to school and give him a hot meal per day.
But barely a year later founded the choir "Voices for Africa" , an association that has been dealing in almost professionally orphaned by AIDS Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial STIs include syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydiae (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are most concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute believes that the sexual contact between men are responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
Heterosexual adults, chlamydiae associated infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and the human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections were observed in this group.
Among young people, the rate of infections associated with significantly higher than in other population groups chlamydiae is observed.
According to the European survey, three-quarters of all infections occur in young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the change in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years the figure has risen from 1,967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of a tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and thus remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100% protection.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close personal contact.
Experts recommend to anyone frequently changing sexual partners have regular exams.
Most STIs can be cured quickly detected and late sequelae can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations, but also to collect funds that the singers with their voice through the whole of Germany, means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros Esitjeni" says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self- confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, at one of their grandmothers, for example.
The suckers, that 's what we call the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them hold up to 14 orphans, they offer them a home and ensure that they make every day on time to school in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one is allowed in a safe place in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and helped build two barns. With the assistance of the American health organization PSI, the association has organized a screening test for HIV for many people.
This does not of course, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that affects sexuality."
This is curious, coming from a country whose king 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch in sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These customs sanctioned by the state, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Yet there are condoms every corner adds Annette Lennartz, " but hardly anyone uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh. "
To promote some cultural exchange, the chorus of Imbongi on a trip together every two or three years in South Africa and sing songs full of longing, courage, confidence and black identity that many people in the forefront of the black continent still know the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white people who sing in African languages is a sign of recognition as it not only creates a good mood and joy, but sometimes hard as a tear to some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes to Esitjeni where singers visit their downline.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find the light," say the people there.
And after a journey of 8.733 km as the crow flies, back to Heidelberg, before these singers who tap their feet in the rehearsal room of Bergheimer Straße, there is also light.

Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice could reach 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained in three studies published Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly immersed in the shade.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or asteroids may have hit that Mercury.
However, no one made any connection between the discovery of water and the assumption of the presence of life on the planet, says chief scientist of the Messenger probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other essentials of life arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send pictures to the earth, such as small gaps through which we see the infinite.
The image from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
As Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This detail of a photograph taken by the infrared Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars : the oldest stars are blue and more difficult to identify pink dots, are the "newborn" in the delivery room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered a region where stars are born, called "W5", a little romantic name in the constellation Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
The NASA Spitzer Telescope photographed the blazing brightness of a star dying.
The donut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies.
In the vast Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, the gas and dust to form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this room galactic birth.
The Pleiades star cluster also known as the "seven sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope makes the colors more value.
This infrared photo, Helix nebula, like a red eye, looking at the viewer directly.
It is 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarities with terrestrial continent have earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and infrared photo can observe a spectacular color.
Only the infrared Spitzer telescope detectors have been able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest mysteries in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are remnants of a moon of Saturn that disappeared about 4.5 billion years without a trace.
One of the biggest and sharpest photographs has ever taken the Hubble telescope is one of the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years.
The Trifid name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (split, divided into three) because three trails of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginning of a cosmic pileup in the constellation Ophiuchus : 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies is the rush towards each other, the collision is unavoidable.
The Hubble Space Telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you do not like the technical abbreviations, you can use the nickname "wheel Southern fire."
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula lies than 1.400 light years and is composed of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the common house dust.
This photo was made from optical and X-ray images taken from different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of black holes is 430 million light years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest of our young Milky Way star cluster.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy the light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there was only gas.
Scientists believe that he was born shortly after the big bang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe : the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galileo did the USER a year later for stargazing.
Since the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see deeper into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is immense. The mirror itself reached a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to save.
The diameter is still about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The Hobby- Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its uniqueness lies in its capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this ability is similar to those of the largest telescopes in the world mirrors.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
The telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "search for extraterrestrial intelligence") by leveraging the computing power of the machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO in Chile.
Its main mirror will reach the impressive height of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 items mirrors.
However, the telescope can not take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaii 's Mauna Kea volcano was considered the largest in the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory observing the sky with the Subaru and IRTF telescope.
A new giant telescope should be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of the mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration can be admired.
However, the images of the most important area we come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
April 24, 1990, he gives us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced February 2, 2011 she had found 1,235 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space earlier in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first infrared space telescope mirror has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will be to find the mission planned by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang light.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also home ice.
However, no reliable data exists on this theory, as Messenger orbit much closer to the north pole of Mercury.
Radar data indicated decades the presence of ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have certainty.

Drink daily butter, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach worthy ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of life.
A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach worthy ages of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of life.
A survey of a country in which we are still relatively young at 97 years.
The journey in the Talysh Mountains is a frenzied romanticism.
At the bend of the many turns in the road, the small bus trundles along wooded hills, torrential rivers and small farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it is almost in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the Deep South of Azerbaijan, on the border with Iran is only a few kilometers.
It is here that saw the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh, about which we do not know much, except that they speak fluent Persian and Azeri and they have a very large longevity.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town with his boastful too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not fit at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the trip from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to cover the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country needs its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist spot.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be by the festival of the oldest people in the world," said Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
One can discover the lives of about eight dozen Talysh region with more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows a black and white.
Here is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120.
Still have a child at 136 years
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Muslumov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years.
There are, however, no birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest documented person was 122 years of age Muslumov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had had 23 children. At the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl.
Şirali Muslumov would he cheated a few decades calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, he also heard the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"A surprisingly elderly also live in parts of China, Japan and in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "also in Sardinia, there are men who are incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish the scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
It is nevertheless a fact that the people of the region Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people over 100 years.
What is the reason of life in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh the Azerbaijani tourist guide explains that Talysh have special genes.
By cons, Fatulayeva, museum director, thinks it is a power issue.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, the high-calorie meals Talysh, who like meat, bread and dairy products in particular, many of whom drink a daily glass of melted butter, are good health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves youth people? At Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, it is still relatively new to the region.
Mirzayeva who claims to have 143 descendants, living in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a churn, which she fights tirelessly content.
Eight people live here under one roof, including a son of Mirzayeva and a girl, who have long adults.
Two small children running around the house too.
In the kitchen, it makes tea for guests served in typical armadus glasses shaped belly.
Mirzayeva white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf hiding long tresses of dark blond as his son tells us proudly.
I always washed my hair with milk, and so I 've never lost and they kept their color.
"I never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate what comes from his own farm : tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
My whole life, I 've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took command.
The language of propaganda surprise in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, yet a man who led his country as a dictator, hardly knows limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him thereafter.
Anyway, the elderly Azerbaijan unfamiliar distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, an amount that ensures a good standard of living in the region.
And maybe the son of long graying Mirzayeva is right "seniors enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.

The "human rights" in the Constitution omitted
The revolution reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep divide in the country.
The draft constitution based on sharia is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president is not stingy with words filled with emotion.
We need to make the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was for the whole people, but especially Christians Copts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular.
For all members of the opposition confused and disunited desperately afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologetically, have temporarily limited the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its business "to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world did not really know what it wants to save the engineer of 61 years, holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California.
The judicial power be reversed?
234 articles written in haste by the predominantly Islamic constituent assembly 100 people during a night tour de force of fifteen times are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the decision is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But that really does the word "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the Islamists use the vague wording and the margin of maneuver resulting legal to apply a strict interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case it is suggesting that a newly introduced stating that, with regard to all matters relating to Sharia al -Azhar University article should be consulted. The property is the most important Islamic institution of the country and its brilliance shines throughout the Sunni Muslim world.
This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy monitor the legislature, which would de facto tutelage of the judiciary.
Many parts of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts are employed to suppress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also reads in the project, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote the moral and values ."
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of the film art and literature.
Clearly, it would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article explicitly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another item not to offend or defame the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
For cons, the article does not define an offense or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the formulation suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend people."
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the President or tell a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Many points are open to interpretation in the project Morsi put to the vote and, in his own words, will "soon" be a referendum among the Egyptians.
"The revolution reborn"
The opposition is mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the Islamists.
Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual harmony in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," joked Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that the draft Constitution is "to throw into the dustbin of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi want to foment a "coup against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to the palace and the reverse," exclaims Said Jasser, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for," said the Egyptian media as Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced not want to monitor the referendum, which involve its invalidity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, has called for a demonstration against - not in Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a large prayer was organized at Cairo University.
Veiled women and supporters of Salafist, who participated in large numbers, chanting "the people demand the application of the law of God."
"Cleans our country", they asked to Morsi, stating that "the Qur'an [ as their ] Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir square, where everything began, would quickly rise to a similar to a civil war situations.
Obviously, this is what the supporters of Morsi wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood has said that opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as his supporters had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box with the direction the country should take.
The project certainly Islamists win majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry against this constitutional process that would have imposed extend until February and include all social forces.
The lawyer of Human Rights 48 years and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in jail or court under Mubarak.
He did not because he shared their worldview, but because for her human rights are indivisible.
This is the reason why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the end is not even uttered once in the new Constitution," he laments in his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of the three branches Morsi has discouraged lawyer.
These measures are flagrant violations of the rules of democracy, and they generate a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president takes away all his powers," laments Saeda.
But a democracy can not function without civil society.
Saeda feels abandoned, including the international community, who watches the battle between the different political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could afford.
A protester on Tahrir square warns: "you give birth to a monster that will no longer be possible to control."

The rakfisk Norway : is it the most fragrant of the fish world?
The five million people who inhabit Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could it be linked to the local appetite for extremely fragrant fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of clothes wet and dirty football.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway 's most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and the smell everywhere, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period - as the smell as you want it exhales - of up to one year.
When darkness sets in and it's cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this amazing culinary specialty.
"You eat it raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," said Havard Halvarsen, local full-time firefighter which is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and donned a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer to rakfisk aquavit," says Havard.
Drink kills odor.
I tried a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it's not bad - it looks like a sushi who spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk back to a time when Norway was poor before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels airtight and salty water in autumn.
Then, during the winter, when properly fermented fish came out and - no doubt with the way diminished by alcohol - eating.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, migrating mainly to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was there not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, vital, well qu'odorant, the past of Norway.
This is part of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost € 10 each.
Norway does not often talk about it in the international news, which is not displeasing to him.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When talking about the killing, they talk about "the incident of July 22."
The Norwegians have a hard time accepting that their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 70s, Norway owes its wealth to the oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," says Anna, our waitress, the blond hair and piercing blue eyes, the image of the Nordic welfare with a tray of rakfisk hand.
We are - how do you say - conservative people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with caution - all, except for a small percentage of money from this industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries throwing money out the window, over the years has led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept the strings of her purse tight.
"As long as you can ski in winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk," she added in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and I 'm queuing to buy me something to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made of momentum, a real discovery is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stayed is one of many places where one uses rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter is wearing a bow tie, surrounded by plates rakfisk.
It's like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor- Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because fish fumes.

The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
As the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC looks at the difficulties that lie ahead and the people's expectations, which are many.
Traffic in Mexico is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a security checkpoint has been in place since Monday, blocking several key access roads in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential sash to become the new president to lead the nation.
A complicated task ahead.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results that must be the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is experiencing a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government is committed to the people of Mexico to reduce the violence," Pena Nieto said U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will help us achieve this goal.
Rub before the U.S. President Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A populous and sprawling state that surrounds the capital. On his favorite place, the opinions about the new leader are divided.
Direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is recorded in the memory of all.
Local ascribe the development of tourism infrastructure in the town.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads once bumpy and full of cracks.
Plates bearing his name are attached to the exterior of a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We expect him to implement sustainable change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and party M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of safety and economics in particular, we expect real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years without fault in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of Congress Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations in the party for Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects criticism of opponents who criticize the new president of lacking charisma.
It is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent view of the country.
This is a great statesman, and above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobblestone streets of Valle del Congratulations could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the highway overpasses, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military has been called in to fight against the drug gangs that plague neighborhoods, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster area, was found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who have killed.
Critics of Mr Pena Nieto, say, at best, it has failed to stem the problem of killings against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration refuse to see the reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood Irinea Buendia fight back tears when she shows me pictures of his dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reported by Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
"When I got home, it seemed to me that his body had been washed," said the Lady Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and rigor mortis had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses wall, next to a cross where the word appears : Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities have treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, a crybaby.
They want us to accept what they say and let him keep silent.
"But it is not normal to have so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receive his scarf Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president promised he would make a priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be as good as the president that when he was governor," said Olvera, in Valle del Bravo, Congressman.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.

Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse, say prosecutors.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning allegedly suffered during detention.
The trial focuses on holding Manning in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that sequestration Manning was done under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to show on Friday that the soldier Bradley Manning - accused of being behind the largest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. military - has missed many opportunities to complain about the abuse he claims he suffered during his military detention.
In a cons -examination with Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft Meade, Maryland, Attorney Shift. Ashden Fein said records weekly visits with Manning by officers during his nine month detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaint about his treatment.
The cons -examination - during a hearing, the defense filed a motion demanding that the Manning case to be dismissed because the kidnapping was carried out in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment - took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide while in custody.
This military intelligence analyst, was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source.
During Friday's hearing, Fein examined Manning forms that officers had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in the military prison at Quantico, where he was subject to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers questioned Manning and recorded their answers.
When Fein mentioned forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that treated him was "excellent" reserved his guards and the treatment he had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaint of ill- treatment, although the officers have directly questioned about his treatment in prison, said Fein.
Manning said he had verbally expressed concerns about some of the problems and visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said they would take care of, but they did not record the issues raised.
"They wrote" no problem "(after addressing concerns), and so far, it does not mean that I had not caused any problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col.. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in an interview in January 2011 with the Special Committee, which met to discuss suicidal thoughts he expressed in writing a few months previously.
Manning said that his intention for the meeting was to change its restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The soldiers said they had assigned him this restrictive status - a level below the close monitoring for risk of suicide - for protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted it... I withdraw that status to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he contemplated suicide when he was in Kuwait and he fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact of not having been kept informed of what was going to happen or what is happening in the rest of the world was very scary.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon in this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I would die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company.
Manning also said that the only things he had was a mattress, a blanket, slippers, clothes and glasses.
He tried to keep moving as sleeping or lying in bed during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, there was a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he returned at night, they wake to be able to see his face.
Manning 's lawyer has filed a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge questioned Manning reported on an allegation in his testimony Thursday - after being forced to sleep naked every night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front guards and other prisoners one morning during the call.
Manning testified that at no time has it been allowed to cover herself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions Friday, Manning said he had deduced from the order of his guard he would drop his coverage could hide his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had told him to let go.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked last night, as he tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer he could have used the waistband of his underwear or flip-flops to get hurt, but he had not.
That night, Manning testified that her underwear, flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers are hoping that at least the judge will consider his experiences during his detention and significantly reduce his sentence should he be convicted in a court martial trial to be held at the beginning of next year.
The defense has said that Manning will plead guilty to the lesser offenses and to fight for the abandonment of other expenses deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include theft of public property or records, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmission of information on national defense.
If all the charges are held, he incurs criminal imprisonment.

My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, they remind Mexicans difficult times, he said.
Navarrette said that American Mexico are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the lobby, before the customs and immigration, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two ways: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), one for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing what to file direct me.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" in my life.
It is an ethnic qualifier, as well as one of my friends use when they say Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York when they say "Italian".
Then I became a "Mexican- American."
But here, it was Mexico.
And who on earth was born my grandfather, no need special qualification or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native, and I can not lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I went to the file "foreigners."
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of the two countries meet, their themes are immigration and drug trade.
Pena Nieto had also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
Pena Nieto and is committed to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give written half their territory gunpoint.
But the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, when a U.S. official formula any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear - in the Mexican press, and among the elites - complaints about the way the Americans affect the sovereignty their neighbor.
Montezuma and children looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Want it tackles the subject of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country does not offer.
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person can be a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, the person represented a typical profile - dark skin, uneducated, from a poor village, etc..
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are living the American dream, we went to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight that this is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give the United States.
Furthermore, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them a humiliating defeat and they stare at us as if we were people of lower strain and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed while living in Mexico, they would never be gone.
And we do not end up stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and has legally immigrated to the United States as a child, remember that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans assert their identity more strongly and Mexican Americans are upset.
Although American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of both countries.
In addition, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel part of a country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in neither.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And the United States, we are considered as Mexicans.
And now, to further complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans work as ambassadors of fortune in Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We must explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that you should visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And if we consider wage inequality, corruption and violence associated with drug are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You'll have to make your own, amigos.
C'est normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century ago and a half, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans always want them how members their families were treated there is not so long.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.

Old quarrels, new Middle East
The cease -fire between Israel and Hamas is still a setback for peace.
Does it can never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed suggests that such hope is vain.
While persist the same futile arguments about who started, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed, and for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the city of Israel and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring shattered everything, and like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught by the regional turmoil.
Maybe further intensify their struggle a little more.
Yet there is every reason to think that it could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that is no winner and no loser
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the cease -fire granted on November 21 continues, the fighting this week have reinforced the partisan force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which runs the Gaza Strip since 2007, is targueront have forced the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has suffered a beating.
Killing some of its leaders and repressed the 1.7 million Gazans in one of the most miserable and crowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine now in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas became rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power booming, once the closest Muslim ally of Israel, has taken up the cause of Hamas, as well as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of Golf.
Hamas members rejoice and say that the growing Islamist bends around Israel from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia has dominion, to Syria, where Islamist rebels to overthrow Bashar trend can Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas 's allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the south side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, the most populous and far more central in Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who has ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a matter that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of the hardline Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas was given in a box.
The interceptor missile system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its full support, and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence.
More importantly, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although the rocket fire from Gaza have killed 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with a more hawkish party leader Avigdor Lieberman that of the approach of the election on 22 January, was the best part.
Why pamper these pesky Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, not they would launch rockets, like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind the wall and hit her head as soon as they come out.
Perhaps supporters of the hard line will prevail, but it may be that the Arab Spring changes everything.
Even if the Islamists take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority is to address the problems in their own countries.
The defense budget of Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbors combined.
Start a war with the local superpower does not help new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Morsi worked with Barack Obama for a cease -fire which bodes well - and could be the start of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that is becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a magazine that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic front.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains that advocated by reasonable people found on each side, and most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A hope, small and short term, is that the cease -fire will give the opportunity to people outside of the cause.
Egypt, which must now get down to stop the flow of weapons into Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state according to the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state that the proposal next pseudo state in the UN.
Obama also has an interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he has not presented its own peace plan.
Back to the White House, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow view.
Stability in the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Laws for packets of neutral cigarettes came into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of diseased organs cover the dark green packets are identical, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced with a dark olive green and horrible pictures of diseased organs and pictures of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking parents.
Out different pictures and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the strictest in the world scheme of tobacco packaging material.
The Australian federal government has stated that the objective was to deter young people from smoking by eliminating glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people do not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they never begin.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by the tobacco companies through their brand message", said Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed such that children associate the crown of a logo to a princess. "
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rates in the world and if these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this legislation.
Tobacco companies have said it would boost the black market trade, which give greater access to cheaper cigarettes.
"Adverse consequences result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others have said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the horrible packaging, has risen sharply since two months ago that British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in the High Court of Australia.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is pending renewal stock.
For us, business is good.
The only problem, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the portion of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship and the need for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by companies and local sites, but it can not prevent foreign websites to make.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and you no longer have only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the place of choice," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in contributions from some ordinary people in favor of brands on social media like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves whether it is a private citizen who loves cigarettes and Marlboro that has bothered to make a video, or if it is an orchestrated campaign by a marketing agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focused on the new regulations in force rather than marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic against the new court decisions - these countries reported to WHO that trade is unfair disadvantage, although none of these countries n ' has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO ruling should be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries on similar legislation on packaging.
Canada was the first country to mandate warning pictures on packages in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos do not bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you tidy package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package that displays a picture of tumor of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason that will stop me is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging made it difficult storing packets on the shelves.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours," said Yu
"The government had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's good, we stopped and put the key in the door," he added, raising his arms to heaven.

In a world constantly connected, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during the Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is quite annoying, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention the duty-free shops).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in the development of the child praise of boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths or to foster creativity.
And as we are, for the most ever before several types of screens, we do not know the benefits of boredom.
So we should welcome with open arms the trouble?
Yes.
And names.
But I will.
First, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom : A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The problem goes way back," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii include Latin graffiti evoke boredom, they go back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After traveling many publications and presented the idea to a panel of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as an experience that is "wanting to do something, but could not embark on a satisfying activity."
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he said, is that the person is not undertaking a task that she would like.
With apathy, he said, there is not the desire to do something.
What is at the heart of the trouble, he said, is "the interruption of attention processes associated with low mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can closely resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, we think we are bored when he is in fact a problem of concentration.
In their study, "The unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have demonstrated an earlier experience in which participants listened to tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard from the next room, the sound too high a TV that had no relationship, others have just heard the TV, and the third group was not at all heard the soundtrack.
Those who heard the TV at a low noise level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed the problem to concentration boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or time consuming task, interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, when you perform a boring task, "like looking at objects on an assembly line, the music can help you to not get bored."
In fact, he said, now we know that when it wriggles or scribbles, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wriggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all miss a day or another - the delay of my flight tickets, a speaker with a monotone, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "scale of susceptibility to boredom" in the 80s.
The scale includes statements such as, "One of the tasks I perform, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I do not have time to do everything."
Using this scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and particularly need many and varied stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are quickly bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported being bored in school and for homework at home, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if today's percentages of boredom, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reached its highest level," particularly because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question again : boredom is it good for you?
Sometimes not, as in its extreme form, this can lead people to make absurd physical, make paris or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The problem is the way that the brain was found to let you know you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at NYU
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you're bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term but not long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, it will miss, but he has not learned to care alone or to regulate themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And "this autorèglement pass from one situation to another," he says.
Your child will not only learn to be entertained, he gets control of himself in other areas.
I do not think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I do not think we should criticize.
Feel comfortable outside the constant bubbling generated by the activities and the technology is the goal toward which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood is in agreement on this point.
"We need to annoy us more often, but awakens an acute boredom and frantic to be connected to something that makes sense desire," he said.
According to him, what people look for is a way to get out and enjoy the downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."

In Colorado, no guidelines for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student in a university football player in Colorado, was charged for something that will soon become legal in the state : the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the field, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment suitable for consumption - minor offenses, each accompanied by a fine of 100$ - and a court date.
"We are treated like criminals," said Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote in Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving a small drug depends more on the place of the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which passed a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been dismissed.
The police stopped indict adults 21 years and older for minor marijuana possession, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are in the most conservative districts in Colorado called to accelerate the business of existing marijuana and continue to charge those who have.
Meanwhile, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West are currently voting to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana licensed by the state in their neighborhoods.
"Things are moving so quickly that I do not know what the future holds," said Daniel J. Oates, the head of the Aurora police, east of Denver.
Regulatory agencies of the State of Washington also pose a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to set up a licensing system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, like it or not, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first for use in therapy and now regarding the personal use.
"Colorado has a regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system recognizes Mr. Smith can do no more than suggest what works.
" There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves, he said.
The law in Washington, called I- 502, take effect on December 6, leaving a vacuum in a year, during which the permit system does not always exist, while marijuana possession is legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state to guarantee adequate access to marijuana approved and prohibits the installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a playground or nursery.
"There will be no more difficult than urban areas to install a licensed business of selling cannabis, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area locations," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for the legalization of cannabis a research group recently formed.
On November 21, the police chief, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e -mail announcing that his officers "City Attorney" (public prosecutor) no longer pursue people 21 and older who own small amounts of marijuana, and the police had to stop to charge people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said that the police apply the new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and will continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, "district attorney" (Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a strict vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with cases of possession of marijuana, primarily to put pressure on users to do is detoxify.
Currently, 119 people were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to take action against those who have committed an offense which, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offense," said Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of the limited use of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, does appear more adult for possession of small quantities.
The public prosecutor of the county, Pete Hautzinger, supported the decision, but also decided not to take no action on all cases of possession of marijuana.
"I do not feel like wasting my time to continue to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have backed the measure, provide appropriate personal consumption of marijuana legal and governmental framework is not easy.
And conflicting reactions that have been observed in various U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"There is a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer who represents the Denver accused of marijuana and is expressed as a local spokesman for the "national Organization for the reform of marijuana laws" (national Organization for the Reform of marijuana Laws).
"They spent a good part of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, also, they have a hard time accepting that this is legal," he said.
As the first state to address the limited use of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are becoming a test case for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials provide a new frontier sales legalized, they anxiously await the federal government guidelines, which always designs the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will sell.
Despite some publicized arrests of patients and therapeutic marijuana sellers, especially the federal government allowed businesses to sell marijuana for therapeutic purposes to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While the police are not likely to break down doors to enter small bags of drugs, it's a safe bet that she is opposed to licensed shops selling marijuana for personal use allowed by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities were not expected federal authorities take action.
Even before the vote, some local governments have approved a moratorium on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a one-year deferral.
Last week, the city of Montrose received a 6-month moratorium, and should impose the ban next week.
"We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where a license is granted to someone and then find ourselves faced with a federal issue," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community voted against the amendment.
We consider the vote of the community rather than the state vote.
Many questions arise.

Petronella Wyatt : I was bullied and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
This is not only today's students who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me to find a prominent place, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheater that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late '80s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and began to cry.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper The Evening Standard claimed that I had left the university, because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said facetiously that I had left after being forced to drink from chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
Impossible de traduire votre requête de la langue source (yorouba) vers la langue cible (anglais).
Yes, I fled because I was bullied and is subject to constant harassment.
Not because of my name rather outrageous, or due to the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior : my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised Margaret Thatcher and I was supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about it now, you tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of students of the center-right suffer the same type of persecution.
Increasing and institutionalized hatred Tory students at Oxford is such that last week, some of them have demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the student lounge (JCR) of Corpus Christi College said they were "often isolated, and felt personally attacked undesirable" because of their political views.
They want there to be a representative on the Committee of the university to equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland : Young, Bright and on the Right" ("Wonderland : Young, Smart and Right"), devoted to politics among students, who portrayed the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It discovered including student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (Ouça)", which moves in a Rolls -Royce, wears a full silver and moves with a cane chrome head.
In other universities, students Conservatives say be treated as scapegoats for the establishment of higher tuition fees. "
Luke Black, 20, vice -president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a bias to the left growing in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even having met them. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable" and Cherill Stephanie, 19, president of the Ouça, says that there has been a deterioration in the attitude of members of the JCR against people who are center-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate and the well -being of members," she said.
I was the only one to feel this way during my first few weeks spent in Oxford.
I joined in September 1986, I was then 18 years old and a crippling shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had passed the denial of Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the earliest days of the week home when the new students become acquainted with each other and the teachers, I had a foretaste of what was to happen next.
I discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm against Tory students, but in addition, they took pleasure.
It was as if the policy on the striking miners, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved in wood classrooms.
The first sarcasm which I was the victim involved a translation into English of French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said Dr. Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
J'ai perdu offer.
Pitt, a small man with pustular face, easily prevailed.
"Is that the Thatcherite refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" Has he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes in your spare time - well, if you 're not too busy to make friends", he launched a surly tone.
I returned to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
It was a second year student studying English, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the Ouça.
"I know who you are," said he said, gently.
I'm afraid that this is so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.
It's already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with what Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy failed.
A first year student of philosophy, politics and economics which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
Tu es contaminée.
Other students included the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How the Tories do they love?" requested one of them.
They hit each other, is not it? "
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people with the same views only after nightfall?
I should have become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years were like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only teacher was openly Tory Norman Stone, professor of modern history who taught at my university.
He was hated because he was not only conservative, but also because it was foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never there.
He hated this place provincial and insignificant, and its adherence to Marxist- deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," me - he said.
I started to commute between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded urban friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford, in the forties, all political viewpoints were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," me - he said pathetically.
They would not do that, not in the city of dreaming spiers.
Even my Communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I 'm sure it is to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired from my frequent trips to London, my emotional strength has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a work session directed the following week, when another history teacher suggested in all seriousness, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Blushing inwardly ashamed, I admitted to being a victim of brainwashing my parents and treated them as "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who drove the final nail in my coffin Oxfordian.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed hidden in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I 've never returned.
You can call me a whining wimp.
But no child of 18 should not be the victim of such bullying in school.
The tragedy is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 prime ministers Tory, but also has an unshakable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino prefers elegance to the reputation"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", opened in London this week, ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen- Bornemisza Museum and other famous clients of Italian fashion.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England is the only place worthy of the British capital to host an exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
The designer has been recognized at the opening of "Valentino : a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective brings together more than 130 haute couture created for his fashion house in the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose protagonist is the only "he signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and part of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, there is an overwhelming number of private letters and pictures signed by the cream of aristocracy, since Princess Salimah to Lord Snowdon, passing by Princess Marie -Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino presents his personal memories as the trophies of his social mobility : the modest fashion of the city of Voghera, northern Italy, the idol of the international jet set.
There is nothing wrong with love royalty.
"At least they do not crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some stars of pop music," said the Baroness Fiona Thyssen- Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives generous and elegance.
"We loved all be invited in his chalet in Gstaad," says the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of the beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, a modèle portant Valentino
The Argentine supermodel Valeria Mazza has not forgotten the charisma of fashion.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment in the decor, food and music.
"With him, each guest feel important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Parade line of nobility
Life Garavani is not a story of obsession, but shared love.
He likes well-educated people and the holding and they love it too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk seventy feet wide offering to exchange roles : the visitor takes the place of models and should scroll on the podium to enjoy a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor had chosen Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among the audience of mannequins, we find names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette- Marit of Norway, Bulgaria and Rosario Sophie von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and fashion in 2006
Many of his clients say the first Valentino clothes are like first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest "Gillette" and a jacket Fall-Winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It's a gift he had given me," said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to all others for her femininity, her great love of women, and because our sublime beauty," added the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and illuminate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola Arenberg can not it either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
As a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, it was possible in the late 90s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress with a ruffled skirt, a bustier and a draped neckline down.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," said the Italian aristocrat who divides his time between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg maintains dresses evening fashion with "the utmost care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, it is also all the memories it conveys."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie -Chantal Miller wore at her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (so the designer calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with pearl inlay, twelve different kinds of laces and a train of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority in the specialized press, this dress is a historical fact of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of clients of high society."
Obsessed for years with the "skills" of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani accumulated many honors than any of her husband clients.
"Its refinement, its calm, neat and perfect appearance has always struck me," admits Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"It was spotless, the years have no effect on him."
If this is a princess who says...

The hardest job in the world : the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, holders of Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by wearing 70 pounds of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who work literally in hell.
This is the Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their living by carrying the sulfur Kawah Ijen volcano in eastern Indonesian island of Java when Anto.
He has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulfuric gases from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air.
After collecting large rocks sulfur, which weigh a total of nearly 70 pounds, it installs in two bamboo baskets that on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance to a snail's pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps not to trip and fall into the abyss.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell to his death in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago.
Minors Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every pound of sulfur extracted.
Once on top, he cut a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and with painfully heavy baskets, they walk 3 miles to balance a mining company has installed a little below 1,850 meters in altitude.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, we can say, its employees, which it pays 662 rupiah (five cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents) in the petrochemical industry since this mineral is present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to whiten sugar.
"As we move about 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) per trip," explains Anto, who generally performed three trips a day.
Each takes him three hours and ends exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort is triple what he would earn in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary of two million rupees (167 euros)," said the carrier who worked once as a bricklayer on the resort island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (€ 6.20) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia is also indisputable that the sulfur : "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought it in Java to convert to Islam."
Anto asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gas.
At age 27, he spent three of his life to defy danger on the Kawah ljen but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill although it covers her face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto asthma, difficulty breathing, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" he promises in a more acceptable English.
Battered by life, friendly and intelligent young could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but instead, it is the work of a mule.
It shares a hovel unhealthy wood with other carriers, rises each day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not stop the spring night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue, and shines in the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto down into the crater by illuminating with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money.
Some carriers charge 400 baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite his comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized removal of sulfur to save costs and provides no equipment to holders who are self-employed and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not impinge on one of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) increase in camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), the guards of the park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done to the animals, not humans" protests Madrusin a corpulent carrier 42 years working on Kawah Ijen thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 pounds, it ensures that it will not stop working "as he can," because he needs money to raise his three son, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to retire, I will die here as the volcano is my life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps miners in thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains of suffering serious illnesses... which obviously add their usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 pounds.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur volcano, three trucks carrying the warehouse Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a goat track overgrown with weeds.
"I'm not going to retire, I will die here as the volcano is my life," said Unainik by opening your mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of five children, aged 30, also works as a porter sulfur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from one generation to one of the most difficult jobs in the world : those that are human mules volcano Kawah ljen.

Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans throw the responsibility for the absence of children 's career, stress and cost of ownership.
"Singapore's population must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mints, but despite this, or perhaps because of it, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The words come from a rap group which uses local references like "Let's get a bun in the oven" to mock the birth rate in Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hoping to draw attention to the problem in a fun way with this advertisement.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fill their "national duty".
It is intended solely for the Internet, we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt it was a topic that we should address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like throwing perfumes pheromones or organize parties of speed-dating.
Many of these ideas were creative but they have not necessarily worked.
So we said the following : what could be more creative to solve this problem to make a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
He spent 1,300 U.S. dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favor of marriage and fathers grants up to$ 15,000 per child, extends maternity and distributes taxable profits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich city-state and high-tech South - East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore in accordance with its national distribution of population currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was at the above 2 is considered the replacement rate, it was in 1976.
Why Singaporeans do not they have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Division of the National Population Policy, says that this is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"It allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond marriage and starting a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single and delay marriage and childbirth, which results in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy designed to dramatically increase immigration to offset the decrease in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abounds a barely disguised xenophobia against immigrants, especially to the Chinese who are accused of pulling down wages and not integrate.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for the ruling party in Singapore last year saw its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a country, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and selling very successful.
However, authorities are concerned by the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" are selling much faster than larger units.
They are more popular in the sense that these homes are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
To the extent that these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district downtown, it seems they do not go have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, that is why the people should defer," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," we said another young twenty years.
Men and women report their careers, stress and cost of ownership and education as reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, they are Singaporeans themselves have the final word.

What is private is private offline online
confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the area of privacy that we can protect from intrusion."
What is a private matter that for 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers they are exposed on the Internet disseminating events that certainly would not share offline?
The elPeriódico newspaper interviewed five boys aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four cases, they associate the term "something very personal" on a personal level and "password and username" when applied to the social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," said Jorge, ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post some nice pictures or games.
I also discuss with my friends.
"I will not share any of my pictures or someone who would be a fool," he said.
The boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene pictures of naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his new followers on Twitter.
The Majorité sont de la famille.
Her mother is gone, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write interesting tweets.
, He adds "I do not post I just know they meet me."
"Social networks are fun, I can talk with distant relatives or friends, so fast," he said.
He says he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust someone who would recommend him abroad.
The case of Jose, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask on the latter, he admits he does not know 20 people on his friends list.
"That does not worry me because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to the boy, no he made advances or has asked for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or required, I simply would delete my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as the cyberstalking are not foreign to the boy.
A relative of one of my friends was extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close his account.
"It has only happened in private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure their account securely.
Unlike Jorge, the young would post pictures of knowledge in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or upset.
"Even though I know it's cyberstalking," he says.
key Questions
Marielos Porras, English and a degree in Education and Learning teacher, considers that, to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networking is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras said that Academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in education from Yale University and author of "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We who are digital immigrants must teach them there, while we ourselves are still learning," she said.
He added that the issue is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criteria on what should or should not disclose, publish or tell an age where they do not have the maturity to the do it."
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the privacy of children and teenagers is to use questions that make them think.
"Tell them not to do useless," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things that you will not be telling a stranger, why are you doing on the Internet?
Or, it would please you to publish a picture of you like a friend you've published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify pictures of holidays, you ask other people permission to identify them?
And also, everyone does it need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a primary school teacher and guidance counselor, says it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish it," he said.
According Guardia, it is essential to remember that children do not talk to strangers.

The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration was made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration was made public, although it had been previously announced and theoretically adopted by 7 agents present.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency noted at the outset that it would be disclosed after the end of the summit, and said they would be released from one moment to the other on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the Peruvian President Humala Ollante, in brief statements to the press.
The journalists' access to information about the summit was always limited.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential meeting with the message "private session, small audio" was aired in the press room.
The lack of information circulating among journalists were those given by the press officers of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the appointment, except spokesman Peru.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, the President of Peru sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" from the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document which concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the Arab South America Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it was earnestly requested by the press, he had not released either the statement also called Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, we can verify that the document was published in the month of March.
In two international events, the Peruvian authorities tried to establish safe for all journalists transmission systems, but they have limited maximum obtaining information.
The summit also concluded with the agreement of both Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court in The Hague slice a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at the regional appointments and said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the arguments of both sides in the lawsuit that Lima filed against Santiago and begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict resolve disputes that we wear today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," said President Piñera giving a handshake to President Humala, next flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents would defer to the ICJ took place after the British this week denounced the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international court, after a decision on the maritime boundary with Nicaragua it considered seriously flawed.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay suspended Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of ex- president Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The attorney read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been established between the South American country for a total of 17 million dollars of investment.
Among the agreements reached, he said that the countries of Unasur would establish "important steps to achieve the goal of the South American citizenship by developing agreements permit."
He informed that action would be implemented to enhance "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and against international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices all of South America, and assess joint and effectively the risks of natural disasters."
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should help to increase our productive matrix and see a brighter future for our people," concluded the President Humala.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," he Peruvian president said in a speech.
Among these projects, he said that five were Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two focused greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will be reinstated in the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
The need that Latin America is a region of prosperity and peace, and having built good relations with its neighbors, is another topic discussed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting regional appointment, he hoped to meet his counterpart in Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a judgment of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will ask to have a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will deal with it in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Santos Ortega and the presidents will meet Saturday in Mexico where they planned to attend the takeover of the country 's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, in the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc will meet beforehand to approve the Plan of Action of 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defense in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the presidency pro tempore of the regional bloc.

"South America has to learn how to integrate a European citizenship," said Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a purpose for which the "South America, in this case, should follow the example of Europe."
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told state television, TV Péru that Europeans "were killing each other at the second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they almost formed a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project of establishing a South American citizenship promoted by members of Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas we want to belong the past,"he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President was in favor of the restoration of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San José on human rights.
Those who keep harping never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans have it all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington with funding from the United States," he said, referring to the asylum granted by Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa sure he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but he instead met its "deep democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at the time, "there was founded suspicion that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish justice that required to undergo its territory for questioning on an alleged sexual offense while "clean Swedish law allows you to do videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said there was a risk that the mental and physical health deteriorates Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problems, but nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health deteriorates by being enclosed in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects the health of anyone," he says.
Correa noted that the asylum granted Assange solution since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the awarding of a pass that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of procedures from various European" he mentioned.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe conduct tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as all that allows its legislation, as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioning via Skype tomorrow the problem is also solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert itself as a defender of freedom of the press and he said that he would not tolerate was "poor, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or evil politicians but bad journalists in the pay of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this light, it welcomed that this is not the kind of journalists "neither bankers nor the hegemonic bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlight his re-election, "he deepen the revolution continue the path and draw the right track."
Correa has also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the agency "should be firm and do not tolerate opportunism and coup attempts State disguised" because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan" democracy.
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers "perfectly appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundary between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, the will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not met.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflict is inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the desire to move forward together.
Must solve a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the good resolution of the dispute over maritime borders opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and stated that it is "beneficial Latin America seize the international forums if the two countries agree to accept if it is closed" judgment.
Referring to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate in upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he said he saw this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the primary to February 2013, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, the power has never interested me, but in situations as unjust as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guarantee the eventual victory but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, this would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from politics.
If ever we lose, I will also.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa also refers to new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Cuba.
I just chat with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that medical treatment routine was already planned and awaited the end of the season to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of the health of President Chavez," he commented.
The Head of State of Ecuador participated today in Lima in the sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with a call for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.

The AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the test result : positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, the doctor had tried to make "less painful" in vain.
The young man hid his family.
He decided to take one of her illness and started to learn about him and his determination was as recently celebrated its 43rd anniversary.
It is, undoubtedly, one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and stigma.
So even the director of a clinic IMSS avoided saying goodbye "because he was speechless."
In the meantime, having AIDS meant death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of patients who began treatment at the right time and the survival of the population generally be exactly the same,"said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes to reference this information was validated in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The expert in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was not a deadly disease, but the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the assignment level of the immune system that showed patients at diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 count of 200 and up to 50 years for reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
Put simply, this means that someone who receives a positive HIV diagnosis to 25 years, "while he remains under control, can live up to 75 years without any problems," said the scientist asked.
To put this development in perspective, you should know that the life expectancy of Mexico is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died of AIDS cases increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the annual report UNAIDS), but it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the national database died.
Nothing to Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths until May of this year, but we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem is not access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we never missed medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, and then they learn in advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive then they already have an opportunistic infection, you need to have a greater impact on overall mortality is make earlier diagnoses and for that must provide testing massively to all people who ask."
Experts and members of the State Council AIDS prevention Jalisco (Coesida) agree on the proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who had to make his test in a private laboratory simply because a friend had done and that, despite his young age, he was already wearing the suffering of AIDS and Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they will die and not want to know.
"If I die, it is better that I broke three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to me and the other person," said Fabrizio, who has agreed to share her intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help through his testimony, those who are afraid today, when walking the World Day against AIDS.
They do the test, they took risks, the more they know their HIV status earlier and better, and they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS by the year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, journalist Guadalajara who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "was actually increased condom distribution, before it gave us one or two, now we are given packets percent is fine, but it follows, that still, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections, there are teenagers.
The question: "What are you going to do," asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers n have not wanted to hear, ensures the journalist.
It proposes to redirect the inefficient distribution that condoms are not only sold in counters, but they are found in public restrooms and distributors in places frequented by young people.
It does not encourage promiscuity.
There is not no more to pay their girls and motel, as was the Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not how sex works, it is best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
On recense cas cluster 13.435 (12.158 Aids du VIH et du 1.317).
The state is the fourth state in the nation in number of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are through sexual contact, through blood 6% and 2% perinatally.
An estimated 50,000 people living with HIV, as recorded for each case, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.

Ratified a judgment on appeal by a court of the United States ignores the debt restructuring of the Vitro group granted through commercial bankruptcy Mexico. The scenario causes a harmful precedent for all national companies with branches in neighboring countries with solvency problems.
So it seems that survival procedures authorized by Mexican law firms are not valid in the country in the Stars and Stripes in opposite of the international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the ruling on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, left helpless Mexican companies face the possibility of their embargo properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the leading manufacturer of glass from Mexico to enter the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors must register under the bankruptcy law of the United States, the Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans court, said that the procedure main business failure is formalized in Mexico.
The first would involve denounce international cooperation procedure in the event of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the Model Law of the United Nations Uniformity of International Trade Law was established for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Second, the judgment states that without the vote intercompany recognized the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, debts Vitro subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, Mexican law recognizes this possibility.
In fact, if Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There is here a half- dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, which the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies had guaranteed the debts.
In addition, what is certain is that, since the votes of the remaining subsidiaries, in any way Vitro creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say the funds "vulture" as Aurelios Capital Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional Limited and Liverpool would not have won a majority.
The vote was 45 votes against 37.
A given omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the predicament he met since 2008 without stopping at the grave economic crisis qu'affrontait the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For now, the company's family González Sada will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to be taken in its entirety, ie with five judges, as only three had voted.
The insurance claim the non- recourse and prosperity requires a retrial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico on behalf of amicus curiae ("friend of the court") which was detailed in the procedure followed by Vitro under the Bankruptcy Act trade, noting that the freed agreements signed by the two countries to put the same level as in paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
In addition, he noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, the rules fixed for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Pile-up of two parts: they knock Vitro and they knock the country.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Le basket-ball est toute ma vie"
The globe -trotting basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground, and thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in the sport for over 60 years, either as a player lower league, team player national basketball manager and leader of the national team, BSN, with Vaqueros de Bayamón or as president of the federation of basketball.
"I have worn many hats in basketball throughout my life, and even more at the same time as when I was chairman of BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the Federation for the year 90,"recalled Reyes during a visit to his home in Primera Hora Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball is my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating when he made this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia reminiscent of the unconventional route, testify.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves the most are those who remind him of his way as a player in the team Vaqueros in the mid 50s until 1982, after 15 years as co -manager or team manager.
"This has been my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the chance to participate in eight championships Vaqueros in 1967, either as manager, co -manager or manager.
It is many years of satisfaction, including five played from 1971 to 1975 championships.
I then removed during the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy entered Team BSN.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over the team, "said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been an officer here who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a tough player for you, it measures two meters.
You want it? "
This is how to start Mincy, a top player has ever had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gauss, who was naturalized and was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gauss would help us try to win another.
He welcomes the championship Vaqueros with Gauss, but only at a distance since 1988, he was already the head honcho of the federation.
In that time, he preferred to take advantage of its costs and those of the national team Mincy.
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the pre- Olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the World in 1990, we got the 4th and we should have won the bronze medal at the Canadian judge if we had not replayed the last game, Reyes said.
The team of the World 1990 is it the best national team you 've ever seen?
It is among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we put a beating Team USA, which was quite similar to that won bronze at the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to attend the World 90 because of knee problems.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy during the pre- Olympic tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace suspended by the imbroglio Pan American Games in Mar del Plata players, we won gold against all odds.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, it is Piculin Ortiz.
His stats at international tournaments are impressive.
Person in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as did Piculin.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work that Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest achievement in the federation?
Being part of the most glorious national team between 1988 and 1995 period, and the fact that in the early 1990s, BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What you have there to do?
There are things I wanted to implement, such as regionalization minor categories.
For example, that boys only play Ponce in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during the national playoffs.
Today, young people traveling and playing too so it is not necessarily needed.
At least I saw the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips of my time on YouTube, I take my grandchildren and from time to time, I go to basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of deliciously detestable JR Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The drama series on CBS Ewing clan and their families has been disseminated in April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed JR?" Invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman 's character is almost killed, has generated speculation over the world and millions of dollars played in of paris.

A course dealing with the "End of the World" has started
Each week, students explore topics such apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when the religion teacher Stuart Charmed decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew where he launched an irresistible hook : the end of "big statement" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which is many people refer to as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Charmed professor had no idea what to expect in the coming months : the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a tax gap that some have dubbed "Armageddon debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, place where Christians of the end times theorists thought to trigger the Apocalypse.
"I did not realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic I never knew half," said this week Professor Charmed his students at Rutgers University -Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today as we were 30 days later and we were telling, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the Apocalypse.
And it is not the only teacher to teach about "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, the last of the story.
At Temple, assistant professor Barry vacker offering the course "Media, Culture and end of the world."
Each week, students explore topics such apocalyptic nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and how they offer some hypothetical scenarios guide human conduct.
If nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell my students about what was possible, probable, and not credible," said vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and Amara Solari colleague, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, simply titled "the end of the world."
"We add" 2012 "to be able to teach the course again, if the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "impending disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not allow for student choice but to work "until the night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses were pretty popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for advanced students, consisting of 35 students.
We received e-mails several weeks before the semester begins, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, in turn, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people can do for comfort," said Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology, 23, a native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University -Camden.
For fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and Nursing 25, said he watched all apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a teacher has told us to believe in the end date of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and somehow we have discredited," said Julie zegle, year student at Temple, 21 years old and a native of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, there is only one key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety about the Apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which is that people respond to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people do not think about it," he says.
It is predominantly English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University La Salle who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that here gave lectures on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", we - he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have with the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, we talked about many supposed date of judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next time" or philosophize the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the time lightly.
Many have told us that they thought going to parties "at the end of the world."
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh a whole," said Samira Ford, communications student 20 years.
