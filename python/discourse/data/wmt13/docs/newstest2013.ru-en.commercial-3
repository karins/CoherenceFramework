A republican strategy of the resistance to the repeated election of Obama
The republicans' leaders justified their policy with the necessity of struggle with falsifications in an election.
However at the Center Brennana believes the last the myth asserting that the cases of falsifications in an election in the United States are rarer than the cases of death from lightning stroke.
The republicans' lawyers have besides counted only 300 cases of electoral falsifications in the United States in ten years.
To one say with certainty: is possible these new tendencies will have negative influence on the electors' attendance.
Actions, in this sense similar, partially discredit a system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada the American states bear responsibility for an organization of the federal election in the USA.
Just therefore the majority of the governments of the states since 2009 adopt laws, complicating a process of the registration or a voting.
This phenomenon has received a new scope after the election in November 2010 which has brought the republicans 675 new places in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills, restricting right of the voice in 41 states, were mistaken only for the alone year 2011.
New laws of an election require an elector to show the identity card with photography and a proof of the presence of American citizenship.
Besides that these laws reduce a period of a voting ahead of schedule, abolish right of a registration of an elector in a day of will and take away right of the voice from the citizens having conviction.
Before an election of 2006 not a single American state obliged the electors to show the identity card with photography.
Indiana has become the first state which has introduced a similar requirement.
The supreme court of the USA confirmed constitutionality of law, adopted in Indiana, in 2008.
The republican authorities have hurried to spread this practice also other states.
During the two last years they initiated bills, obliging the electors to show the identity cards with photography, in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec the American citizens haven't such a universal identity card as a card of medical insurance.
Indeed, 11 % of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people that have been at age, necessary for a voting, haven't the identity card with a photograph of their staff, yielded by the governmental organ.
Besides that, five million new electors in 2012 haven't a similar document.
In this case the cost of reception of the necessary identity card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect the youth, minorities and the people with the low level of the incomes.
Indeed, 25 % of Afro-Americans, 15 % of people, earning 000 dollars less than 35, 18 % of citizens are older than 65 years and 20 % of electors haven't from 18 to 29 years the necessary identity card with photography.
But all of it yet not.
The students - the electors who as reckons, vote for the candidates the democrats, for several states it isn't permitted to use the identity card with photography, yielded by their training institution.
But the same states permit the members of the fishing and hunting clubs which vote in the main thing for the republicans to use the certificates, yielded by these clubs, for a voting.
Not a single state required before 2004 a proof of the presence of American citizenship for a voting.
For the first time the similar requirement was brought in in Arizona.
Beginning with 2011 more than ten states have adopted laws, requiring the electors to prove that they are the citizens of the USA.
These measures obviously are aimed at the fact to restrict a voting of the descendants of the Latin America.
It is believed that two thirds of the Latin-American electors vote in favour to the Democratic party.
Besides that the republican lawmakers initiated laws, abolishing a registration of the electors in a day of voting in eight states, in 2011.
They have also restricted right of the individuals or the groups to give help to ones who wish to register.
This restriction hasn't taken place without consequences.
So, 2004 years, for example are during an election the campaign of a registration of the electors has helped to introduce about 10 million citizens from the lists.
In the same time measures taken beginning with 2009, have brought to fall on 17 % of level of the registration of the new electors in the year 2010 in comparison with 2006.
In addition republican lawmakers have adopted laws, aimed at reduction of a period of a voting ahead of schedule, in five other states.
So during the general election of the year 2008 in Florida 33 % of electors that were voting were the Afro-Americans, although the last were only 13 % of the common number of electors of the state ahead of time.
The same happened also to the descendants of the Latin America.
Presenting only 11 % of electors they were 24 % of the citizens who voted ahead of time.
Which unlike white forming 76 % of electors among being voting were only 46 % ahead of time.
The, of course, lawmakers-democrats and their partisans actively oppose acceptance of laws, restricting a registration of the electors.
Several projects of laws were the vetirovano governors-democrats.
The action of the most ambiguous laws was suspended in intervention by the General Prosecutor of the United States.
It has allowed partially restricting of negative consequences.
Laws, requiring producing of the identity card with photography, have accepted so, for example only 16 of the 34 states.
Nevertheless the new rules that have entered action certainly will complicate exercise of selective right in an election of 2012.
The critics from the democrats condemn a prejudice of the laws which were adopted seeing obvious orientation to the fact to influence results of the election of the year 2012 in the key states in them.
The report of the center of Brennana from 2011 demonstrates that the states that have adopted these laws present 171 of the 270 voices, necessary in the electors' board to win the presidential election.
To assert with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will have essential influence on results of the presidential election of 2012 is else too early.
Only one is doubtless: these new theses will have negative influence on the electors' attendance.
Actions, in this sense similar, partially discredit a system of American democracy.

Screening of cancer of the prostate gland: study a test or not?
In fact the test for a dog gives the occasionally erroneous results false negative, and occasionally also false positive which result in useless medical intervention.
The men, also so reluctantly passing medical monitoring, have something to doubt from even more.
To study a test or not?
We have asked two specialists' opinion.
In investigations, carried out in the United States, the numerous cases of infection among the investigated groups were observed, it is difficult to interpret therefore obtained data and it is difficult to produce any distinct recommendations.
The other European investigation on this time has detected the different level of mortality at those patients who have passed screening, and ones who didn't pass him.
This investigation has also shown after 12 year-old observation that it is the probability of appearance, the metastasis is on higher for 30-40 % up with ones who haven't passed screening.
Therefore I would recommend to study a test beginning approximately 50 years, or since 40 if one of the direct kinsmen had cancer of the prostate.
The men of Afro-American origin are also subject to heightened risk.
Acceptance of a correct solution is once the crayfish is detected the key moment.
The crayfish can be both aggressive, and slow.
It is for a patient necessary to explain the degree of risk of his cancerous disease, proposing the possible versions to it, without obligatory treatment of the cancer of the prostate which doesn't constitute danger for life in long-term prospect, and making a choice in these cases in favour to active observation of a disease.
For today many the men at which the cancer, course for treatment is revealed, won't elapse for their cancer is not aggressive and doesn't represent threat to life.
We shall propose active observation to them, and if the disease begins to progress, we shall begin treatment.
All we with precision define as more frequent criteria for making of a decision on one who is have to or hasn't to study course for treatment.
Thus I would recommend nevertheless to study a test.
But it is important to also consult about the doctor to define if it is necessary or not to study this test.
There are urologies in the cooperation with the International association, Movember has created an instrument, allowing estimating of everything behind and against a pass of a test for a dog.

To prevent a disease
Regretfully miracle recipe doesn't exist to prevent cancer.
Notwithstanding progress of scientific researches observance of the healthy lifestyle remains the best way to decrease risk of a disease.
It is believed that, if all people superbly fed, and sufficiently moved, to prevent would be is for 30 % of cases rako possible.
"If nobody more smoked this figure would grow at least to 50 %" - the, Andre Bol'e underlines, press secretary of the Canadian association of the crayfish.
However by estimations, 10 % of the crayfish's cases are caused by the heredity.
Several types of the crayfish remain perfectly inexplicable.
For the Canadian association of the crayfish struggle with smoking remains priority notwithstanding decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is connected with 85 % of cases of cancer of the lungs.
And it is the factor of risk for many other.
It causes severe harm to the health of the people.
"Even today 1,5 million smokers - in Quebec exist", press secretary Andre Bol'e speaks.
A fact: in 10 years after a refusal of smoking risk to die from cancer diminishes half giving hope.
The weight
According to data of punishments the redundant weight and the obesity also contribute to appearance of the disease.
They increase risk of appearance of cancer of the mammary gland, the large and direct intestine, the gullet, the pancreas gland and the womb.
"Investigations show that the regular physical activity during the whole life protects against cancer of the large intestine" -, is added to the Associations.
Supply
Also the association recommends to restrict consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases risks of appearance of cancer of the thick bowels.
It is necessary to avoid also the sausage articles.
Temporarily closing of meat by smoke-drying, drying or salting can result in formation of the carcinogenic substances.
"The last can cause harm to the cages of the body and result in the development of a crayfish" -, is explained in an Association.
The vitamins
In the last years many scientists dealt with investigation into influence of vitaminic additions on the development of a crayfish.
But for a given moment it is impossible to name the results of these investigations unambiguous.
In opinion SCC investigations into vitamin E give contradictory results.
If one of them has shown decrease in risk of the development of cancer of the prostate then other has given opposite result.
There also is no full clarity in estimation of influence on the development of a crayfish of vitamin D.
However Mr Bol'yo emphasizes that it is important to discuss its worries and family anamnesis with a doctor.
"The surrender of analysis doesn't result in cancer".

Boson Khiggsa is in the details
In past summer the message of the fact that the scientists perhaps have succeeded in detecting boson Khiggsa caused real flurry - also not without cause.
It isn't believed little that explain this boson the mass of all particles in the universe, nor much.
Besides that it was the last particle existence of which was is predicted in the frames to Standard the models -, it the best, or, in any case the "the least imperfect" description of nature and behaviour of matter, - but which earlier didn't prove possible to detect us in an experimental way.
But the physicists as far back as not before the end are sure that the matter concerns just about boson Khiggsa.
We know, without shadow of doubt that we have an affair with an indeed new particle and that she strongly resembles boson Khiggsa, predicted by the Standard model.
Besides that new presented data are in this week on one large physical congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed, although for full certainty of some data don't obtain yet.
We shall imagine nevertheless that the matter concerns about boson Khiggsa, for we also shall see the chances to be mistaken seem the minimum that mean it *really*/*the_same*.
Is, in this world one law is perfectly unavoidable, saying that two things cannot turn out in the same place in the same time.
No possibility, to bypass this rule is even not try too diligently, otherwise you will harm to itself.
But although physics of the elementary particles is, it turns out that there in it too is one law of the similar character: the principle of exception Pauls which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space in the same moment of the time if they stay in the same "quantal state" enough strange peace this "state" is concluded, in the common lines, in their some descriptions -.
Proceeding from it the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
We find the respectable citizens named fermionami who are judiciously subordinated to a principle Pauls in an alone corner.
In different fuss the bosons, the infamous gang of the anarchists who haven't respect to anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can imperturbably turn out in the same place in the same time.
As a site, (by the way perfectly unusual), imparts Particle Adventure of Berkeley's Laboratory these bosons, the groups: the X-particles, to which boson Khiggsa relates divide in its turn into two about which we here shan't speak, and "the particles of force", by which and in some kind the basic forces of nature spread.
It is necessary to emphasize these most bosons, such exotic creatures as it was possible to think are not everything.
In fact if you succeed in reading this chronicle then which due to one incredibly banal boson: the photon, or "a particle of light" is it is "a courier" of electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when one particle, having an electric charge, accelerates or changes a direction it "violates" the electromagnetic field in this particular place about as a stone, thrown to a pond.
From this "violation" the electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), is born, and not what other as a photon - and, subsequently, one of the bosons "of the carriers of force" this wave is.
A more stable field
The same happens also to boson Khiggsa, only that difference that, so that this boson appears the other field, Khiggsa field must be "violated".
An only very large stone, to reach very and very high energies, as if the matter concerned about the pond the surface of which was able that has frozen to shake Khiggsa field is to excite him necessary is however much much more stable than the electromagnetic field;.
Here why is the huge accelerator of the particles as one who is exploited in Tarna - the Large Hadron Collider, being a ring with the diameter of 27 kilometres! - for achievement of so huge energies, necessary.!
The analogy with an electromagnetic field is useful also also to the explanation of correlation between boson Khiggsa and mass.
In fact not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some as, for example the magnets one interacts, different - there is: the sheet no paper, for example never won't *HOLD$ON* oneself on a refrigerator.
Particles as though as not all interact with a field of Khiggsa: ones who interact, have mass, whereas other (as a photon by the way) haven't her.
Thus what "can all these investigations bring", does Mrs. Plamondon ask?
They are used for science for a checkup of correctness of the Standard Model (centimetre), and it also allows the physicists to fumble with disagreement between results of observations and the forecasts of centimetre.
Besides some of them passionately are willing that such a disagreement will transpire, by the volume to the smallest mismatch can open a door for "new physics" and stop up some holes of the Model.
The last, it is necessary to say everything, else has the essential shortcomings not proposing any explanation for the which for gravitation (ouch) or dark matter forms about 80 % of the universe (ouch *THE*th)!.
But as long as such disagreements haven't been found in Tarna.
Consequence
To predict benefit of these investigations to everyday life of the average person is more difficult, but it would be a mistake to suppose that there is no her.
Look: at the very beginning of the 60th years the pioneers of investigations into a laser of Bell's laboratories wouldn't be able even also to suppose what revolution their works will cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but that is not more.
Even the indeed deceased physicist Uillard Bojl who worked in the Laboratories of Bell where in 1960 the laser, was invented and which oneself has developed, the first continuous laser (previous were the impulse) in 1962 yrs, said that the laser had been initially considered rather as "laboratory gadget".
Present…
And besides that, the application can be found for the tooling accompanying investigation.
The, for example one of most Uilliard Bojl during its optical investigations in 1969 has developed a small sensor of light.
This sensor, although it quite wasn't its initial predestination now serves as "the eye" for all the digital cameras of the world and has deserved the Nobel prize in physics 2009.
It, of course, doesn't mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider necessarily will change our life, but it only shows in fact that everything can be.

Palliative help is the best way to die…| "Debt"
In a Commission behind worthy death the delicate question of the end of life in Quebec has been recently discussed.
The debate shortly must be resumed, and in this time the bill is prepared.
One nevertheless in this most important region much else is in for making.
"Debt" have tried to glance closer.
In all several weeks ago the gentleman L.. Else lived alone in his apartment into Monterezhi.
The cancer of the prostate that was destroying it from within has given adjournment for two years to him.
"To me gave five years, I have lived in seven" -, he says between life and death lying in a shelter from palliative departure Victor-Gadbua in Belyoj in a bed, where have come the day before.
"But it is always the shock, to for it prepare, - oneself is impossible", he speaks.
The disease does its work: the incredible weakness which doesn't allow independently going to a toilet and even independently to feed.
Sitting behind the table on which appetizing lunch stands he gives in and agrees that will help him to receive food.
He braces up, even contrives to smile, speak with the unfamiliar people who work around him, the medications, bring for him, lead him to a bath.
The courage is before common death.
"My strongest wish that I have been cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating" -, he confesses.
After several hours the personnel has found a medication for this ailment.
That "during life it is taught that the man must urinate standing - tells Pierre Broder, the psychologist in a shelter from Victor-Gadbua to us".
To regress before the state of the child - for some is unbearable humiliation.
"Everything depends on the person's ability" to reconcile oneself with degeneration -, he asserts.
The for in opinion of many people, dealing with palliative departure important events sluchayayutsya and in the very height of this degeneration.
The patients which enter palliative shelter Victor-Gadbua are still sick of cancer.
The forecasts allocate them the maximum of three months of life.
At this phase the command of the doctors and the nurses doesn't grant more help named "curative".
Madam A., 89 years most of all fears die "in consciousness from suffocation".
But on the other hand the disease has allowed me to recognize its children.
"I have the good children" -, she adds.
"I don't want more anything in life" - she speaks before permit to place a mask facilitating breath in her.
She, as before, expects in coming days of the last visit of her son that has come from Italy.
In shelter Victor-Gadbua maintenance of the body and help in supply with the help of a group of the volunteers are granted.
It also is palliative departure which remains, when to make more nothing is impossible.
To make death more comfortable.
In 700 inhabitants' Quebec on each 11 one place in the institutions of palliative help falls.
It is very few taking into account that early or late we all shall die.
Here the life continues in the best conditions, which is possible, doctor Christian Martel' - alone from the doctors of the shelter explains.
That be comfort, physical, emotional or sincere.
To dying we shall agree to grant oral of rinsing from a brandy or Pepsi, seeing what it will ask.
We more don't make the diabetics monitor the level of sugar.
And the death is the part of the everydayness.
Yesterday in the evening we brought beer for the gentleman Kh.. which died today in the night.
In the morning his son finished drinking this beer in the legs with the deceased.
"We help the relatives as also the patients" - the, Natalia Savar tells, director from maintenance of the patients.
Not one day is in shelter Victor-Gadbua not similar to previous.
Next to the 93 year-old old man which enjoys its last meeting with a family in a yard settling on its pillows during a toast in its honour the young man of 36 years, surrounded with the parents, the wife and two small children and pereprobovashij, everything tragically die to survive.
"Up to 45 years - worriedly doctor Christian Martel' speaks are always occupied with the the lastly half a year from three to five beds cancerous patients at the age".
53 % of patients, received the shelter, are Victor-Gadbua, comes from a house, and *BE* 47 % from a hospital.
The problem of access to palliative departure
It is believed that 77 % of Canadians just haven't the access to palliative departure i.e. to departure which is given to have facilitated sufferings of the patients that have entered into the final stage of their life if that had been on a house, in a hospital or in a shelter.
Also some institutions, such an as a shelter Victor-Gadbua and a Society of palliative maintenance on a house of the Large Montreal specialize more or less exceptionally in departure of the cancerous patients.
Just this large blank of a system of health protection of Quebec makes many doctors - of the specialists in palliative departure fear acceptance of a law, legalizing euthanasia and help in suicide.
Beginning with October circulates the manifest, signed by leading lights of the domain of palliative departure, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and doctor Bernard Lyapuantom, also testifying to their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to the words of doctor Christian Martel' the system of health protection of Quebec is insufficiently effective to insure right of palliative departure of high quality before a transition to euthanasia will be resolved.
She - speaks I saw the patient who has spent 14 days in the section on emergency aid, in fearful pains, and nobody, haven't recently - taken necessary measures to facilitate them.
I fear that the patients wish to die only because they don't receive adequate departure.
In the same time many oncologists try before the last day to salvage the patients notwithstanding the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for Ellen's survival Richard have already been the minimum, when it stopped tiring out chemotherapy.
When I reported to my oncologist that I stopped treatment, she has answered to me, that regret that I stop struggle -, she tells.
In this case she herself told me that my days were believed!
There is no omnipotent departure
Doctor Martel' believes that which ask 90 % of patients about death, thank the medical staff for the fact that they haven't granted their request, after the command over palliative departure relieves their pain.
It is however necessary to note that palliative departure isn't absolutely omnipotent in struggle with pain.
According to the words of *Elsie* Monroe, the director from palliative departure in a Society of palliative departure on a house of the Large Montreal the patients are not receptive to anaesthetization in 8 % of cases.
At the very end of life the doctors often resort to palliative sedatsii, at which the patient sleeps before a moment of its death, either from time to time, or permanently.
One may not more pretend that we don't know of these sufferings.
All more often and more often the patients who don't succeed in relieving pain will be able to have access to palliative sedatsii.
The patients, suffering from pain, always say the same sentence: "YA want to die".
But not necessarily it means that "I want that for me euthanasia will be conducted", it means that "I want that I shall feel more at ease".
Creation of this reportage has become possible due to the journalistic grant from the Institute of investigations into the health of Canada.

The large-scale scandals of a real estate in Quebec
An official the persons, responsible for the construction contractors a construction of the roads, the collectors of means for the political parties and the specialists in an Italian mafia behind a day tell the fact that they know "of a colossal system", enmeshing construction industry, the state employees, the politicians, the trade-union workers and a mafioso, day.
"The industry" which has very dearly cost the taxpayers of Quebec especially in the 1990 and 2000 years.
"I wonder how this system after all means were let into an affair, Jacques Dyusheno, the deputy and the former chief of the police of Montreal jokes, spills".
Just due to him the scandal as collateral in 2011 broke out, the result of investigation into official crimes, connected with the road construction contracts in Quebec, on which is prime minister of that time from the liberals Jean Share, have agreed very reluctantly.
"Dyusheno report" has established a direct connection between an industry, secret financing of the political parties and corruption.
"From the beginning of investigation in 2010, he, only the one Ministry of the transport underline, would keep a billion dollars on the contracts" if some restrained their instincts to take a share.
Sharbonno commission "has already displaced two mayors", he adds hoping that she will succeed "in opening the schemes, standing behind the individual personalities".
The permanent subdivision in struggle with corruption, created in 2011
The created in 2011 Permanent subdivision in struggle with corruption the vast staff of the governmental auditors, the investigators and the analysts has been included into composition of which has switched to an affair.
And, besides that, the employees of the special subdivision "Hammer", who after 2009 have made "the drain cartel" of Montreal, stop overstatement are the costs of the contracts.
Over a distance of the last weeks the series of searches was carried out, and accusations of fraud and corruption some municipal officials, in particular the Franc Zampino and Richard Markottu - the mayor of the small small town, were made.
There is Gilles Vajyankur, having recently resigned from an office of mayor Lavalya, third in the value of the city of province Quebec, the office, on the queue.
He is suspected of multiple reception of the bribes in locating of the state orders.
Besides that official accusation was made several engineers of the service of the ways of the message of Montreal and the construction contractors of Italian origin of including Tony Akkurso and Lino with a Deputy beaten.
The last has exploded a real bomb reporting to investigation "about a system" of reception of the state contracts.
During several years of Deputy beaten gave back to of the 3 % cost of the contracts, made in Montreal, for a certain intermediary tied together with a mafia who in one's turn transfered money of the party of mayor Zheral'da Tramble "the Combined Montreal".
In the 2000th years of Deputy beaten littered money to the right and to the left It has listed more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (there are 000 euros near 68) different the parties of the province, in the main thing the liberals that were having the power then.
Besides that he has confessed that he illegitimately raised funds of the former deputy of the prime minister from the Liberal party of Natalia Normando.
The sewerage contracts in which cost was overstated
"The system" of corruption worked in Montreal faultlessly.
Gilles Syurprenan, the engineer that was being over a civil construction in detail has described her in front of a commission: behind he has received ten years from the construction companies of gifts, invitations into the journeys, on the tournaments in golf, to the restaurants, on the matches in hockey also of the bribes there are 000 dollars altogether on 736 of which in exchange for the sewerage contracts the cost he overstated.
Other official persons, responsible for a construction of the roads, have confessed that they received on the paw overstating the accounts 30-40 % with the help of the false complements.
Then one organizer from the party of mayor Martan Dyumon accused Mr Tramble of the fact that it deliberately closed the eyes with existence of the parallel budget that was filling the party cash desks with dirty money.
After these revelations Mr Tramble has resigned at the beginning of November immersing Montreal in a serious crisis.
Shantal' *RULO* was alone from the first deputies in Montreal that have set up alarm.
The mayor is Riv'er-environment de-Preri in the east of an island her, oppose since 2010 to a sale of the municipal bought area, 5 million are for the dollars and construction boom, resold… for 1,6 million to the developers in height.
70 % of dirty money are in the election campaigns
She says that in the investigation which in the final analysis will be begun, she "will pull the thread, allowing understanding of functioning of the system, swarming with the ants to stop gangrene and define culpable".
This process she kharakterezuet as "is sickly, but is positive".
We are in a process of cleaning of a wound, but the own investigation group and an observer, for Montreal will be necessary to avoid return of doubtful practices.
As we tidy up at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dyusheno notices from his side that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but a role "of the elective official officials, that knew of this scheme", but being not participating in machinations worries especially him.
Taking into account that the share of dirty money of financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70 % he jokes: "I have been said that it was only pale reflection of reality".
The government of Quebec proposes to restrict up to 100 dollars of donation to the parties, but, according to its words, it won't change a situation: "As long as we shan't restrict elective expenses strictly there will be dirty money in a politician".
He requires full rearrangement of a system of allocation of the state contracts and financing of the parties: "We cannot lower lower; boldly bottoming the essence of the things, we shall be able to build a house on the more solid foundation, with the best control and legality".
If this history also throws shadow on an international image of Quebec and Montreal Mr Dyusheno calls on ones who laugh to peep to an own yard…

"PSZH - not the Soccer Club Barcelona"!
In this season you into PSZH attained an unusual scope.
How will you explain this growth?
It can be explained with individual consciousness, but can - also by new measurement PSZH.
The great players have come.
Next to them I grow each day.
Also the technical personnel has introduced much.
These factors make me daily raise the level of my game.
And during a match, it is simpler.
Everything happens in football very quickly.
But I don't incense.
From the very beginning at the center of preliminary preparation into NIF into Klerfontene and before my coming in Sep-Et'en I always marched ahead.
Thus you benefit a competition, set by Carlo Anchelotti…
The replenishment of this summer must hold not the novelty the matches of the very high level.
They know also that each training is very important.
It results in the fact that such a player as me is willing to be at the level and bear down in the maximum.
Besides that Carlo Anchelotti shows a support in my positioning.
Such deputies as Claude Makelele who played at the same position that me help him.
Anchelotti - the master of a position?
Of course.
Anchelotti enjoys respect the whole technical personnel.
There today to him are no equal in the First League, and he is included into the number of the best trainers of Europe.
He has vast experiment, and it has won many titles with the high-end clubs.
He worked with the great players.
I think he will bring the new titles for Paris.
With me with him there was the talk giving hope in the January.
Then I drew back from the entire series of injuries.
The confidence which he has me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of season PSZH?
In the First League Lyon has taken away the leader's place from us.
But we, as before, are ready.
One of our basic aims is the Champion's: League we were exquisitely qualified into one the eighth the final.
What is the aim of the club in this tournament?
We shall try to go as far as possible.
Henceforth everything can be.
We shall be able to say our word by the face to the face with the very good European teams.
We at first want to finish in the first in our group, in front of *PORTO* to have a possibility to receive an answering match for one of the eighth of the final.
Will PSZH be able to become the first-class European club in short-term prospect?
He for it has a budget already…
It is for that to become the large European club for Paris necessary to win the titles and fasten the positions on long-term perspective.
Today it is not so.
Financially PSZH have means to make this project real.
Not to take a title in the First League as in past season, will be a large failure?
Of course, it would be large disappointment.
In this year we strongly wish actual to hook in this champion title.
In past season we were to it near.
The disappointment in May was because we had everything to come to finish the first.
It was very successful season.
We have finished him with 79 points.
The champion's title supposes, as a rule, 79 points.
But the other command, has played more more fantastic season with Montpellier.
In this year, I think, everything will be in an order.
Notwithstanding the fact that struggle for a title have started such strong commands as Marseilles, Lyon and Bordeaux I think that we have forces to win.
Don't you think that the mass media expect too much from PSZH?
It is normal that from us is expected much how much taking into account was inserted, and which the players with us are.
We are completely ready for it.
On the other hand, when we win the houses 4-0 against Trua and we are nevertheless found for what criticize, of course, a little it upsets.
We have a question what primarily the people expect from us.
We will never be able to win each weekend with score 4-0.
We are not the Soccer Club Barcelona!
We try to introduce the project of a game.
The team is formed with the time.
We have proved in the Champion's League that we can accept the modern challenges.
Look, on Manchester, united which doesn't succeed already two seasons in going into the one eighth the final, although they have too spent huge money!
Taking embedded sums into account we presented you on 15 points ahead already to the winter break.
It would be neglect of our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseilles which weren't at the height in past season, was "awakened" by it new PSZH.
It shows that the First League is to what extent fascinating.
I hope that in May we shall be able to smile and tell myself that notwithstanding all difficulties we have won at result.
PSZH, it seems, completely depends on the feats of Zlatana Ibragimovicha.
Well, and that, if it is told that some "Zlatanozavisimost'" exists.
It only means that Ibragimovich is very successful, and that he scores many goals.
He has come for it, and he proves that he is a star of the First League.
Everywhere where he played, he has shown that he is the great player and is a star of the world scale.
In a group we esteem as a person and as a player him.
He too esteems the people who surround him.
The fact that it has made, it is indeed exclusive.
It stimulates also different to improve its game.
T'yago Silva which is one of the best defenders in the world, also justify everybody move ahead.
How have you outlived by Euro-2012 from the national team of France?
As disappointment.
I strongly wished to participate in this Euro.
Regretfully my injury has hampered me in snatching a little playing time.
I saw many things there, and I have gone out from there more strongly.
Today I succeed in holding the good qualifying matches.
It is one, for which I hoped from a moment of my baptism at Blue.
We have extracted the lessons from the fact that have happened in the Ukraine, and now have to behave exemplarily.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deshama at the head Blue?
They for him are effective.
He has the good positions in a qualifying group to world championship.
He is a strict trainer, he is close to the players and inspires on a victory.
Which Loran Blan was.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blan has achieved the aim, he qualified us into a Euro.
I hope that Didier Desham will bring Blue to Brazil.
The good deserved draw (1-1), torn out on 16 October in Spain, is the basic match?
This match has given belief in itself to us.
Each combated for everybody.
Before this shock in Spain, in my career the similar matches weren't.

To pay and sell without help of the banks - from Bitcoin
Sharp contrast with the current money exchange, based on the Central Banks, numbered transactions, between the receiving sides c of commissional collections on their treatment.
Political vision: conviction that the present currency system, consisting of the bank monopolies, results in the financial crises besides that, as often happens to these technologies, is obvious.
In fact Bitcoin invented, Satoshi Nakamoto (the alias), simultaneously is virtual currency (but converted into the dollars a euro)… and a protected protocol of exchange over the type BitTorrent which allows realizing of exchange of the files between the participants of one level.
000 operations have already been registered near 200 from 15 000 computers on network.
Several thousand sites receive bitkojny for a realization of donations or as payoff means.
The course bitkojna reaching the maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011 after five months has decreased to 2 dollars, before return today approximately to ten dollars (courses are specified on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with world exchange of real money or financial products.
Nevertheless the European central bank (ETSB) in its report of virtual currency, published in October, has got interested in this system.
He describes bitkojn as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with a dollar or a euro", also "similar to common currencies".
Bitkoin differs from other types of virtual currencies as "the credits", used for advancement in the video game, which work too much in a process of the game, or to which buy (and occasionally also exchange) is possible.
The social network of Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But always monitor the operations of exchange and process any central organ.
In Bitkojn all nodes of network are the holders of the account book, the auditors, the issuers of currency, pokupatelymi and the sellers simultaneously.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users happens in fact between two electronic addresses, like an e-mail.
The user can choose the other address only for each new payment providing anonymity with such an image.
The set of information, relating to this transaction, signs electronically, with use of a system of encryption with a double key.
The network also can check authenticity of transaction.
What bitkojny due to content of the file perhaps check used for transaction indeed one exists in a public countable book, sent to the whole network.
A registration of new transaction in this book is key phase.
She passes through a solution of a mathematical task, sent to the computers, the having solved which as temporary central bank, receives a privilege to add this new line.
The matter concerns about the phase of hashing of a file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into digital signature, short and unique.
The computers "take" new transaction and add her number, everybody together is in front of that as "hash".
The aim consists in the fact to find the number which will give unique digital signature (many zeroes at the beginning).
Once this number is found other nodes easily check that it is correct.
nerarzryvno the transaction in such a way turns out connected with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature.
If with a view on deception the user very quickly (less than in ten minutes) would wish to pay two times with alone also to a theme, only one of these two transactions was confirmed network - and other would remain unconfirmed, for they have different electronic signatures money.
The computer that has solved a task receives 50 bitkojnov.
To avoid inflation the award regularly shares by half probably before the end of 2012.
The number bitkojnov in appeal therefore is restricted to 21 million, but they are divisible before one, for one hundred-a million which leaves some more reserve…
The complexity of the task also grows with an increase of computational power.
The life of network has already experienced the take-offs and falls.
The sites, rendering Bitcoin services, were subject to an attack, and bitkojny were stolen from the reserves.
"The used defect doesn't concern the protocol - Pierre Nuaza who has recently launched a company assures Paymium - itself" realizing payments by real money of using network of Bitcoin.
This has reported also about a possibility of laundering of money through this anonymous service ETSB.
But cash money also possesses this shortcoming.
Large players, such, how Wikipedia, refuses to receive donations of such a kind.
Different, such as a blog-platform WordPress resolve them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Institute of Weizmann in Israel has recently analyzed a countable book and has detected that almost 80 % bitkojnov aren't in a revolution.
"The gigantic sales" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were swapped", Jon working Kholmkvist, is glad, which there is in Coinabul, deals with conversion bitkojnov into gold.
Pierre Nuaza, the other author of a manual of this currency strongly believes in the potential of this technology as operational network.
She, his system Paytunia is equivalent of the credit card (in real money) or non-contacting payment across a mobile phone, but, Bitcoin for a checkup of transactions, uses, which in such a way goes out, is cheaper.
The owner better monitors his personal data and can in such a way be anonymous.
The system is simple in a realization for the businessmen for whom it is not necessary to set the new devices or software.
It is sufficient to only report the address is "to which possible photograph and recognize" by telephone, Pierre Nuaza precises assuring that he has already thousands of users.
A common tendency to revision of the hierarchical systems in favour more to horizontal exists.
"Before Bitcoin will be established some time will pass, but 2013 can become a turning point" -, he predicts.
ETSB in its report intends by the way to revise versatile risks, believed today increased, in a case of success in this system.

We have gone away from Afghanistan.
What is further?
The French troops have abandoned their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army the time to return the control of its territory to oneself and for the Afghans choose its future not hoping only for us has come.
The Afghan peasants whom we considered as the terrorists have suffered in the main thing from us.
And we ourselves with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban consists of the foreign extremists, the former commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but it is also frequent from the peasants who decline the presence of the foreign army as it was at the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, the Pakistanis, the Arabs, the Uzbeks, the Tadjiks and are archaic, although even them join dzhikhadisty, are old.
They are tolerated, them occasionally help the local insurgents, but they more won't be, once the West will begin to behave more delicately.
Passed the departure of the French troops from Nidzhrab base which I observed from the height of the planted hills with the almond trees due to French credits in an order.
The escorts of the lorries and the armoured vehicles in the accompaniment of the helicopters have reached Kabul not being attacked.
From the end of the year 2014 of invasion the Talibs won't be on Kabul.
Circumstances have varied since times of their insurmountable advancement from 1994 to 1996.
In that time Kabul was empty, the country was on a fire and the blood because of struggle between the different groups.
Taking by them under the control of a country then was perceived as a the kind release, return to security.
The Afghan women have paid behind the these peasants' obscurantism in which al-Qaeda has surpassed them, but their position hasn't improved and in our days.
The former Mojaheds, the Afghan government and the present Talibs are integral in their wish to retain the women the subordinate position.
The basic characters of anti-Soviet war have returned to the power in 2001 yrs.
They have converted into the hustlers, capturing the state lands to resell them under building to the repatriates that have returned from Iran and Pakistan using the huge American contracts of the subcontract.
They are discredited; their, majority, by the way, even oneself didn't fight.
The people, as I heard in the rural area, want the government which would consist not of the thieves.
Many young people want to leave as ones who have managed will leave by American generosity: the outflow of the capitals is significant.
The young people got tired with a war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during banishment in Iran or Pakistan, they have estimated his advantages.
About 65 % of the population are at the age up to 25 years; in Kabul 5 million inhabitants, now exist, the fifth is one of the common population.
The state schools in the cities are filled in with both the boys, and the girls.
It is necessary to provide with the work places of these young people who won't want to return either to obscurantism of the old batches or to corruption of some leaders.
Everybody of including the armed militants likes the mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas which present the modern world, and which see everywhere.
At the present moment the army is.
Will the authorities which will command her be believed legitimate?
The old commanders that were waging anti-Soviet struggle take measures of restoration of the provincial groups which wouldn't be subordinated to the central power already.
Afghanistan, the mountain country with strong local differences, must be before the definite degree decentralized over a sample of the western countries, but the United States wanted to convert him to the centralized state with the strong presidential power eliminating an office of the prime minister which existed since times of the Constitution 1964 years.
President Karzai doesn't want the foreign control especially before the election, planned for April 2014.
But its country, beginning with the 50th years, also even earlier, depends on foreign help.
The industry wasn't delivered on the legs, nor one dam doesn't function, nor one irrigational system isn't repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except the vegetables and the fruits.
The priority is given back to a private initiative.
In a country, destroyed with thirty years of war, the state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
The rumours that Afghanistan possesses huge mineral wealth ran.
It has only reinforced a feeling that the western countries were present there only to seize them.
There without energy for reprocessing of iron ore or copper at a place, without means for transportation to export them across the mountains is no extraction of the minerals.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned a field of copper Mes Ajnak leaving for the international archaeologists (the financed World bank) excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of a province.
It is necessary also that in one beautiful day in an equal way Afghanistan and Pakistan on which to a large extent import and export depend restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French battle subdivisions finished in 20 November.
The new agreement on cooperation envisages conservation of traditional help: the lyceum for the girls, the boys, the faculty of the French language at the university, the French institute, cooperation, there is a support of the archaeological delegation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres.
Since the year 2009 in aspiration "conquer the hearts and the intellects" and execute an impossible task of combination of help with the offensive operations the service "of military-civil activity" at the Ministry of defense (Cimic), abolished in the year, 2012 together with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activity, directed on restoration of agriculture in tens of the mountain settlements.
These works, with intensively drawing in of a local workforce, the restoration of the forests, the fruit trees, the protection of the soils and increase of the area of the arable lands could help to restrain uprising: irrigation, the wells, drinking water.
What shall we leave on the memory for ourselves spending two billion euros on military expenses?
The much more modest budget would assist improvement of the conditions of life of the local population, very stern in these valleys, situated often at the height more than 2 of 000 metres over the level of sea.
The embassy has received tens of writing requests for a realization of agricultural minor works, originating from the local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of uprisings, led by the foreign groups, what the farmers wish as they told me, it is necessary to show the small non military support which would be well monitored and would enter to them directly to them.

The heavy kinds of the Constitution of Egypt
It is new risky step of president Muhammed Mursi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, over a question about a constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives the extraordinary authorities to it he has decided to play recklessly.
Finding everybody off guard he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutive assembly would vote over a final text for the next day.
Exactly the week ago the head of the state granted two additional months to a Meeting to finish work.
The how Egypt leans against preliminary text which several times the corrections were made, which loosens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions, prompt already two years.
This new initiative has only reinforced separation of a country.
In his opponents' opinion the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" continuing "to break a given word" and "trample right".
In a camp of his followers sure that it is a way to finish with the institutional and political crisis accelerating a transitive process.
The referendum must be conducted during fifteen days.
The very short period of the time which a text, the article behind an article make the Brothers give up intention to explain to the Egyptians.
For the president it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent rages over the whole country.
Muhammed Morsi, convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively as he declared in one interview with an American weekly newspaper Time seems.
All the more that the appeal for an accelerated voting resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, or I leave yourselves the extraordinary authorities" which, as is assumed, must finish after acceptance of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constitutive assembly, the Islamists are from the *greater* part was voted for a text yesterday.
The liberals' majority haven't responded on call.
In the middle of November, shortly before a constitutional declaration they flapped a door feeling not in state to bring their opinion.
The representatives of the defenders of human rights, religious minorities or a civil society have made the same.
So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, the spare participants were hastily added yesterday by the morning.
Some are very close to Brothers-Muslims.
Not surprise is that the articles had voted unanimously the majority of the cases.
That fact that one of the few discords of day has arisen around… the time of a prayer, since some members of a committee have believed that the hours of the Constitutive assembly were incorrectly tuned by the way has amused the commentators.
The text over which yesterday the voting walked some more consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention the article 2 in the final analysis has remained the the identical article from Constitution is 1971 years old, saying that "the principles of Shariat are the basic source of right".
Salafistskie the batches for which introduction of Islamic right is one of the basic requirements, "the principles" hoped to replace "with the rules" that would give a possibility of their stricter application.
That fact that this article wasn't changed, *BE* an evidence of their goodwill and respect to other participants of an Egyptian society is for the Islamists.
"Hypocrisy" -, the liberals answer, which see only PR in it.
Because in their opinion Islamization of the Constitution happens through other articles.
The, they indicate especially, on article 220 which grants to the university Al-Azkhar the consultative role in particular in the fact that concern a checkup of correspondence of laws to Shariat.
According to the words of the specialist in Egypt, the, the it calls worry, volume to "the people, decisions, called to receive Sophia Pom'e, not elected and haven't any democratic legitimacy".
We can observe germination of theocracy".
Many liberals besides that are shaken up by the fact that, it will seem, the next rector of this university will be where less moderate than present.
"There at the present moment is no particular religious intervention.
We remain with this constitution within the framework of civil right.
The majority of the lawyers who worked on this text, - *BE* this not ulemy, but the people are with university formation, some studied at a French system" - Aleksis Bloe calms which prepares a thesis on an Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that "ambiguity can arise around the article 220 for the terms, used for it, are borrowed from a religious lexicon.
It relates "to fikkh" (the divas in particular Islamic jurisprudence - the ed.).
And a question, as far as the civil judges are comparable, to make the decisions on it can arise in the future".
Besides its religious aspect, the text accepted yesterday is subject to criticism, since she gives the wide authorities to the President of the Republic.
Brothers-Muslims assert that they have significantly reduced in comparison with which was at an old mode.
The other questionable moment: the authority of the army.
In accordance with the servicemen's wishes consideration of the defense budget will take place not in the Parliament, but in the National council of defense.
A court of the civil faces in the military courts, notwithstanding requests of the associations in the protection of human rights won't be also forbidden.
The last have also expressed concern with the text which they believe ruinous for freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy is saved, and the insult, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, also especially for freedom of the press, is henceforth forbidden.
Besides that not one of the articles is more say about the protection of a woman, Kheba Moraef from Kh'yuman Rajts Votch underlines.
According to its words the ban on the tortures in the article 36 by the sole positive moment shows.
The word which didn't appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to act yesterday as an evening in television manifestations are planned today in the second half of day.
The partisans of the head of the state in their turn will go out on the streets on Saturday.

The holy places, the Navel of the earth and a sea from brine in Israel expect the Ukrainian tourists
The Promised ground binds grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and pervozdannost' nature in itself.
"*Arguments_and_Facts*" have allocated five most important causes over which it is necessary to visit Israel.
We shall bow the holy places
It is worth being at the river Jordan in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that on everybody who enters this "font", the Divine grace condescends.
And Galilee is a place of the miracles of Jesus: conversion at wedding of water into wine of walking of water, calming down of the gale and filling of networks.
Here Jesus has appeared in front of the students and after resuscitation.
But the shrines in Jerusalem are most of all.
The believers here cover the Distance of Dole or the Cross Way of Jesus (over Latin - the Dale rose is the VIA).
He begins at the strength of Anthony - Pretoriume - where a court, was and over the streets of the Old City leads to a Temple of the Sepulchre, Holy on Mountain Golgotha - to a place of Crucifixion, the Stone of Anointment and a place of the burial of Jesus.
The symbolic Christian Navel of the earth, symbolizing rescue of the mankind, is here.
And the monastery of the Saintly Cross in Jerusalem is erected at the place where the wood with which a cross for crucifixion of Jesus has been made according to a Christian legend grew.
In Jerusalem is an also most holy place for the Hebrews - the Wailing Wall that has remained from the temple, destroyed with the Romans in 70
By tradition the people of different confessions leave the notes with the wishes which are afterwards fulfilled here.
To make a journey in a vertical
Ruins of fortress Massada have remained from the secret refuge from the enemies which the Great Herod built in the yr 25 B.C. for their family.
They are situated on plumb rocks in the mountains at the height of 450 metres over the level of ocean.
And only ones, who go in for mountain-climbing by their run can get to them.
An elevator along a ropeway delivers on this historical apex the remaining.
And in the north of a country at the height 1600-2040 metres is famous mountain-skiing health resort Khermon the tourists' on which of the winter months - huge influx.
A bus-shuttle delivers the mountains from the foot to him.
The common extent of the mountain-skiing routes amounts to 45 kilometres.
Heathenish Gods allegedly lived over antiquely putting on apex of the mountain.
To visit the unique museums
In this country about 300 museums.
You in one journey won't visit everybody.
But at least five of them, it is worth attending most interesting.
There is a Museum of Israel, situated not far from the Knesset (the parliament), among them.
The most ancient Kumranskie manuscripts, or the scrolls of the Dead sea, found in caves of the Judaic desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits, are kept in him.
It is worth visiting also a Museum of arts in Tel Aviv.
The canvases of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisleya *Matisse*, Modigliani, Shagal, Picasso are widely presented into his expositions.
It into Akko is possible to visit a museum-bathhouse Al of *BASh*, being several halls of the antique Turkish bathhouses with plaster casts of the visitors and the bathhouse attendants, that time.
In Keisaria it is worth entering the unique frequent-nyj Museum of Rally where it is possible to admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There there are no excursion guides and the souvenir shops.
The entrance is free, and donations aren't categorically received.
The fifth - Museum of holocaust or the Poison-your are in Tel Aviv - tell about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic partition is the children's memorial - built in the memory for 1,5 million, destroyed in the concentration camps and the children's gas chambers.
You call in on him -, and you turn out in absolute darkness.
The stars glimmer.
The names of the children-Jews and the name of the countries in which they have been killed also sound.
The Ukraine there is too mentioned.
Ozdorovit'sya
The three basic health resort zones of Israel are situated on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead seas.
There on each of them are pools, the aquaparks, the dolphinaria and the seaquaria.
It is interesting that in the Red sea bathe even in the winter months, since the temperature of water there doesn't lower lower than the 21 degrees of heat, and air warms up 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and there bathe all the year round.
By the way this most unusual sea is in the world on the lowest point of the planet - 417 metres lower than the level of ocean.
Cerulean water is in it - brine, easily retaining afloat even in general not being able to swim.
The landscapes round are unreally beautiful.
One goes here to study course for treatment with an application of salty water - brine, also healing mud, and treat health at dermatitises, allergies, asthmas, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitises, diabetes mellitus to bring the nerves that have staggered into an order.
To touch the mysteries of antiquity
Them stores the antique part of Tel Aviv - the small town of Yaffo on the Mediterranean seaside.
The famous Sea way, binding Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia, passed through him.
The city is mentioned in the ancient Greek and Egyptiac legends.
Over the legends just here Noah has built his ark, and the Breasts, they have spent from which the saviour beauty Andromeda is here long and happy life.
The tourists like to rove over the narrow lanes, named in honour of the signs of the Zodiac, very much.
Is told, if you touch the walls in a street of "your" sign the Fortune will become benevolent.
It into Yaffo is possible to meet the newly-weds, coming from the whole Israel and even the different countries on *FOTOSESSIYa*.
And in Keisaria - the city of Herod's - Tsar it is possible to rove over a Roman theatre, "take" the crusaders' fortress.
In a Roman period Keisaria was the main city of Judea and residence of the Roman procurators also of including Pontius Pilate.
The sparingly restored theatre is now used for the evening concerts and opera performances.
A tourist on a note
Sending to Israel don't worry about one's imperfect population, English: in a country about 30 %, the Russian language is known.
It is better to take money into a journey not into a euro, but in the dollars is to which easy exchange for the shekels (now 1 dollar is 3,8 shekels).
The urban transport - in the main thing the buses, but in Jerusalem is a fast tram, and there is a line of the underground, consisting of six stations and connecting the Bottom city with Upper, in Haifa - the sole in a country.
In essence it is an underground funicular.
The passage in all kinds of the urban transport costs 6 shekels is to behind which possible ride with transplantations during 1,5 hours.
In Israel by Judaic tradition shabat on Saturday note.
Markets, the shops, the public transport from an evening of Friday before sunset stop work on Saturday.
And the working week in Sunday begins with a morning.
In many cafes, the restaurants and the hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, the seafoods, the fish without the squama and a dish, in which milk is combined with meat.
There the large choice of the dishes from mutton and beef is proposed, the, the the soups and the desserts, prepared on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste khumus, versatile sauces, balls from ground *NUT* - falalel' are the fruits and are the vegetables.
There are no roving dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
But the fattened cats, who imposingly "walk in itself" are very much.
In the evening to see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked automobiles is possible.
*pussy_cat* like the populous places and don't decline regales.
The lease of an automobile is in dependence on a mark, from 37 dollars per twenty four hours (Hyundai Getz) to 188 will treat (by Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - of 15 dollars per day.
And the hire of a bicycle will cost a day 15 into shek.
The tickets to the museums cost on the average 30 shekels each.
A language of the figures
Above three million tourists from the whole world in 2012 visited Israel.
Everything more was to journey and rest came citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and the Ukraine.
The Promised earth from January to October 2012 have visited 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, which is 51 % more than the analogous index of 2010, before cancellation of the visas on 9 February 2011.

"Great and mighty" to Moscow will bring: up the migrants accumulate money the language
As long as the deputies and the human rights activists debate that a law of obligatorily language-testing will give in a country have already appeared the swindlers, vending the "lime-tree" certificates
Yearly 13 million immigrant workers to Moscow, Petersburg and other cities of Russia come.
The *greater* part it is the citizens of the Central Asia: of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenia.
It is their sole aim to make money for maintenance of the families that have remained at home.
Since 1 December the law according to which each labour migrant will have to take an examination in knowledge of the Russian language has entered force.
As long as this rule acts only for ones who intend to work in a sphere of the service, the public housing service, everyday life and retail trade.
However with the time -, is promised in the federal migration service -, the tests will become obligatory for all newcomers.
One will have to besides pass not only a language, but Russian history, also the fundamentals of legislation.
One will have to confirm knowledge of a language both for reception and for prolongation of permission on work.
The exception acts only for the citizens of those countries where the Russian is the state language.
Also the people that have had time to receive the certificates and the diplomas in formation before disintegration of the USSR in 1991 don't fall under action of law.
Benefit, foredoom and the protection of rights
The network of the examination points will work under the aegis of the Institute of the Russian language of the name of Pushkin, the University of friendship of the peoples, the Moscow University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian colleges.
To pass the tests the migrants will be able in all cities; more than 160 such centers in Russia have already now opened.
The deputies of both the State Duma and the federal migration service have supported the initiative in introduction of testing.
And before the law has entered into force, many times have here the human rights activists had time to ask a question: and that, properly speaking, it will give in a press?
What will change obligatoriness of knowledge of a language for both the Russians and the newcomers themselves?
Primarily - the representatives of a migratory service - answer that it will allow decreasing of the number of people, suffering "from labour slavery".
Very many speak the protection of the labour migrants' rights, the head of the representation of the federal migration service of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev explains, now.
The protection of their rights must begin before their departure.
Only the system of an organized set will allow on 90 % solving of the foreign workers' problems.
The problems appear at the migrants without a profession, education, not knowing a language, not having medical examination.
Without understanding of a language -, Sebelev - is sure, the future migrant is doomed to collide with the unconscientious people who under the kind of help will stick in him "to a voucher" to an eery tight hut where it and tens of similar to it will languish the months without food and the documents sticking 12-14 hours per twenty four hours each.
We receive a set of the complaints from our migrants.
"At home him one, is promised and over arrival deceives them, selects the passports, doesn't pay salary - to promised", the head of the Main directorate of labour migration MS Tajikistan confirms Tolib Sharipov.
nasyal'nika don't swear!
Nevertheless, as long as many citizens of the central Asia republics, being going on salaries to Russia, confess that, a language of the country, into which but on own strive not only isn't known, is written with difficulty.
Of course, it is their not so much guilt, as is trouble: few Turkmenians, the Uzbeks, the Tadjiks can allow itself to receive even the intelligent initial education.
However with their families one has nothing to even feed the children with not speaking already the fact to decently dress them, shoe and equip to a school.
Growing to adolescent age such children at the first possibility depart on salaries.
It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of a language -, they confess.
"You feel like humiliated and invalid".
True with respect to a law of a language the human rights activists note one important moment.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have a legal status.
If there is - no status neither the examination nor subsequent official work will be.
In the meantime the immigrant workers' large part, as before, lives in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or an entrance to the Outsiders prohibited"
Many of the newcomers assert that to receive an official status in our country is not so simple.
The cause is in bureaucratic obstacles and the still same language difficulties.
Besides the legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
And it is possible to make the here false registration quickly and only in one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that we in the main thing have the false documents, there is no registration, hence also the cases of extortion are.
"Hundred, two is asked on the cigarettes, tea" -, a citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov has shared with the journalists.
"Crash, don't begrudge, buy painting"
In the first day of entry into the force of law of a language it turned out that not the only migrantskie documents about a registration could be false.
Several "lime-tree" certificates about a pass of the language tests are withdrawn by the employees of the federal migration service already.
The false papers are printed on a common coloured printer.
Of course, the new owners each of the migrants that were hoping in such a way to facilitate themselves a task of a pass of the tests has paid seven thousand roubles for a document haven't got them free:.
It is by a factor of two-odd more expensive than the procedure of officially testing: she will cost the labour migrant to three thousand.
In the fact that the main task for the near future - protect a system against corruption, so that it is impossible just to buy "the crusts" both the representatives of the power and the human rights activists converge.
So far the authorities can promise to the immigrant workers that haven't managed successfully to pass testing from the first time, the time of study of the basic language course.
Work in spheres, not supposing active communication with the people, will be proposed to the, besides that newcomers not knowing a Russian.

The Interior Ministry doesn't take the illegal market of the weapons into a revolution
The share of crimes with an application of the legal weapons is extremely small
The Interior Ministry of Russia proposes to toughen a law with respect to the owners of the civil weapons.
It is a reaction of the authorities to the recent incidents: Press when the shots at weddings have managed without the victims, also the massacre, made by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which, Press have perished 7 people.
The policemen want to forbid carrying of the nonlethal weaponry in the public places and increase the age is to from which possible receive a license on the weapons - since 18 years before 21 years.
The head of the Duma committee for security and counteraction to corruption Irina Yarovaya has supported and promised that the corrections of a law of the weapons would be made the State Duma in the quick future idea.
Not everybody is contented with the fact that the Russian authorities try to struggle with a problem by "twirling of the nuts".
The open letter of which - the authors the representatives of the different public rifle organizations - require to decline "meaninglessly toughening" has appeared on network.
The percent of hooliganism with the registered weapons is the minimum, lawyer-criminalist Vasily Lesnikov has declared the Russian service of BBC.
In statistics of the Interior Ministry in six months of 2012 142 crimes with an application of a firearm, registered in the organs of the internal affairs, whereas only in the same period 1168 thousand crimes are fixed, are committed.
The authors of an open letter are sure, which toughening of legislation in a sphere of the civil weapons doesn't place to suit the criminal on a "black" market.
Now to in Moscow find any weapons in not high price according to their words is possible.
In the meantime in the Interior Ministry it is asserted that a situation with dissemination of the illegal weapons is monitored.
The suppliers: from the plants to the officers
The "black" market of the weapons is refilled over several channels.
The basic such channels are five, retired colonel Victor Baranets, tells having worked over ten years in a structure of the ministry of education and the General Staff.
A screenshot of a site, receiving the orders for the weapons
The first "is army or military trace", i.e. the weapons which was stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"Both the Russian officers and the Caucasians - themselves dragged, *fir_club-moss* speaks, the weapons".
From the the next kind "of the black weapons" - stolen by the criminals representatives of the power structures.
*fir_club-moss* explains that here enter both carried off from the police magazines and stolen immediately from the employees of the law enforcement bodies.
The illegal "trunks" go away from the military magazines into a sale.
The explosions often happened at many military magazines.
"There are proved versions that the part of arsons was made specially - to shelter a shortage" -, the former serviceman speaks.
The producers of the weapons according to the words of *fir_club-moss* introduce their mite.
"Now breed/multiply the private arm plants which don't meet a competition in an international market and throw out the weapons from under the flap on a black market, including of Moscow" -, an expert tells.
One more source of "black" market is smuggling.
Especially many enter guns and the automata from the poor countries of, for example Kirghizia.
"There there is the production occasionally makeshift, and the mafia, which has organized a stream, - the former serviceman explains, has been formed".
From where are the weapons?
The experts have counted what an approximate share of each of the sources of deliveries of the illegal weapons on a "black" market is.
Its report in 2011 prepared the Center of problem analysis and state-managerial design.
The specialists have analyzed reporting of the Interior Ministry and the federal service, criminologic literature and open data of the portals on the arm themes statistics state.
The overwhelming part of the illegal weapons, the researchers write, enters from an army and the power departments.
The half of the whole weapons has turned out on a black market there "over guilt of the officials whose work is connected with the weapons", is told in a report.
According to data of the researchers, 17 % of cases the weapons enter from the places of the armed conflicts, in 14 % of cases the larcenies happen at the phase of the production of the weapons, 5 % fall "on black archaeology".
The seller-counselor of one of the arm shops assures having asked not to name its last name that nobody buys - the weapons, found by the black diggers, already for a long time too old.
The most often of all, as he speaks, the sellers go to a military magazine to get the new batch.
Across the warrant officer the person buys the unit, for example, the gun of the volumes.
She is checked out for him, is conveyed across a small fence.
"He transports her to the city and here sells at 900 euros for a piece with two shops" -, he tells
"True the police in knowledge of all affairs, therefore, periodically when, a plan over raskryvaemosti crimes, burns, conducts the test purchase from the dealers of the illegal weapons" -, a counselor adds.
"As in a luxurious shop"
The seller and the buyer the most often of all find each other across the acquaintances.
I peeped on the sites, into the blogs, as long as the comrade which has proposed to come to the platform "Race" where the person who will drive me away to "a corner" where we shall haggle will be hasn't responded.
I have recognized the price of a trunk only there
Military reviewer Victor Baranets
To come for me necessary the acquaintance who has an exit - a seller-counselor - U tells me such an acquaintance is, but I am not sure in him by the trunk.
The sellers on markets are, but to there come, is too necessary, it is conditional, "from Ivan Ivanovich, which asked to report that with a daughter the tooth has fallen out".
I now come by even couple of knuckledusters across a person in which sure.
He too delivers them only to me, because know that I shan't pass him.
The novices look for the weapons in the different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tasted himself in a role of a buyer of the illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990th, when prepared an article on it for a publication.
The schemes according to its words haven't varied.
"Is the album approximately like the photographs where was all which pleasing" of distance of him.
"I felt as in a luxurious shop" -, a serviceman recollects.
To a buyer according to the words of *fir_club-moss* isn't proposed a cat in a sack - it is still possible to taste.
I, the potential client not just buy - we go with a seller to a forest, we there place target.
"I am granted a possibility to shoot, and we when I realize that the weapons beat well, begin to haggle" - an expert describes a procedure.
The shop is on a sofa
The searchers remove on the Internet on the sites and the groups into "Vkontakte" where it is proposed to buy the weapons "for different aims".
No documents and the personal meetings are necessary for it.
"It is sufficient to have definite sum of money", - paints in an advertising cap with a site "Buy the battle gun or an automaton".
The users leave their applications on him and ask the questions.
And will the minors be sold?
User "Ivan" (the spelling is saved) asks "about without a license finite" -.
"I shall buy volumes Moscow" - laconically formulate a query "of Fedorenkov".
The federal security service has now scattered about huge network of the false sites and rakes the ones that wish to buy the battle weapons with a spade.
The people walk as a hungry fish on feeding up and afterwards obtain coal in Siberia
A military reviewer and the former military Victor Baranets
I heard of such schemes: usually the site is registered beyond the limits of action of Russian laws.
The people receive the orders.
The buyer across an ATM produces payment.
"Photography and an instruction the weapons - where are hidden, press secretary of a public organization "Right of the weapons" Dmitry Kislov tells, in answer are sent".
Victor Baranets asserts that leaving an application on a site it is possible to remain without the weapons and get behind a grid.
The federal security service has now scattered about huge network of the false sites and rakes the ones that wish to buy the battle weapons with a spade.
"The people walk as a hungry fish on feeding up and afterwards obtain coal - in Siberia", he asserts.
Makarov is for 100 dollars
In a purchase of the illegal basic weapons it by estimations of the experts is possible to succeed in sum from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to the words of Dmitry Kislova to acquire Makarov for 100-300 dollars from an organization "Right of the weapons", the gun is possible.
One will have to expect a month-one and a half.
He is shipped from configurations of prolonged storage by the leadership of these magazines of the middle link.
Over official stastistike the department in comparison with January - October 2011 the number of such crimes on the whole over Russia has reduced by 7 % and the number of revealed facts of a larceny and extortion of the weapons, the ammunitions, the explosive substances has been 22,9 thousand, and and the explosive devices has reduced by 7,8 %.

In the USA the employees of fast food and the supermarkets strike
Through work on cash desk "Makdonalds" pass up to the quarter of all American teenagers
The wave of protest actions against low salaries in the department stores of the corporation of Walmart and the restaurants of popular networks of quick supply, such as "of Makdonalds", "Burger King", "Tako Bell", "Uendis" and "Kentucky frajd chiken" in the last days took a ride around America.
As long as nobody starts to predict whether this wave into the ninth spindle will convert, or it is destined to be used up at early phases.
The shares support the trade unions and a number of the left public organizations.
Creation in them of the trade-union organizations besides an increase of the modest salaries which ordinary employees Walmart and the systems of quick supply earn is aim of the organizers of the protests.
As long as this sector of economy almost isn't encompassed with trade-union movement.
46 cents per year?
Actions began in the last week, after a Day of Thanksgiving, on the so named "Black Friday", when on America came down orgy of the cheap sales that has captured millions of everymen and is being occasionally accompanied by brawls.
In this day some employees of the corporation of Walmart in which from the whole world 2,2 million people work abandoned their work places and picketed the shops of a corporation whose goods raschitan on the people of modest and middle sufficiency together with the trade unions and the left activists.
Walmart vends everything in the world, from the diapers, the hunting rifles and the automobile batteries before the vacuum cleaners, the eggs and milk.
Products in its shops on the average from 8 % to 27 % are cheaper than in the large supermarkets.
Therefore many menial employees Walmart issue goods only with them at work.
Walmart has made one of the largest corporations of America availability and the assortment of goods.
According to the words of the critics goods podeshevke can allow selling of Walmart to itself partly because few pay to its employees.
The last also complain about the heavy conditions of labour, for example on a shortage of the lift-trucks or the hand scanners.
The participants of actions on "the Black Friday" required to increase salary and complained about the fact that the cost of medical insurance, granted by the corporation, has hopped since 30 to 100 dollars per month.
Typical employee Walmart, receiving 9,5 dollars per hour, this expense not over a pocket, they spoke.
The scientists from the Californian university in Berkeley prove that if srednuyuyu Walmart increases salary up to 12 dollars per hour it will cost the corporation in 3,2 billion dollars.
It is about 1,1 % larger than she spends on salary now.
If Walmart wholly shifts growth of salaries on the buyers' shoulders then each visit to a shop will manage with it only 46 cents dearer.
In a year they will spend 12,39 dollars on some more than now.
Partisans Walmart enough it is noted that protest actions have happened only in nine states and haven't deposited a corporation nor malejshchego damage.
"The black Friday" lasted in her shops 8 hours of evening on Thursday before midnight of the next day, and in this time Walmart sold about 5000 goods into a second.
Altogether its cash apparatuses produced almost 100 million transactions on "the Black Friday".
The, the representative of a corporation Dan Fogelman asserted in an interview, left site of Huffington Post that the work places has abandoned altogether "less five" of employees Walmart, and what protest action was only "the next PR trick" of with it trade the union that has organized.
"The free cash desk"!
The protests continued in this week in New York, where not department their stores Walmart (they in this progressive city aren't conferred, and there are therefore no them here so far) but the "Makdonaldsy" is also different cheap restaurants were the object.
Makdonalds says that he sells billions of portions, and after it he even doesn't give a hospital to you and don't pay to you for honest work!
Dzhumejn Williams, the member of the town Soviet of New York
At a given moment the minimum salary according to federal and New York legislation is 7,25 dollars per hour.
The restaurants of quick supply with the time increase, but her only slightly, also on the average, their ordinary employees receive 8,90 dollars per hour in New York.
Nobody earns fewer than them in this expensive city.
It is incomprehensible to as it is possible to exist in New York on such money me.
Long ago across "Makdonaldsy" passed nearly the quarter of the American teenagers who earned additionally behind their counters after a school living at it with the parents.
Few people saw the basic source of subsistence in it or planned to be delayed there for a long time.
Now I permanently come across an interview of the employees "of Makdonaldsov" who complain that he must live on this salary and occasionally even feed the children on it.
On the other hand, at a forum of the newspaper of Wall Street Journal the comment the author of which notices that it is irresponsible to acquire the children if you don't know on what you will feed them hangs.
The participants of protest actions which have begun in 6.30 of the morning on Thursday at "Makdonaldsa" in the 40th street and in 15 dollars per hour an avenue required that to the cashiers and the cooks of the system of quick supply had begun to pay Madison-at least, i.e. more than has reduplicated their present minimum salary.
They also required that in a sphere of quick supply the trade-union organizations had been created.
The American law forbids to an administration to obstruct it and punish the activists of trade-union movement with cavils and dismissals.
On the other hand the administration seldom facilitates them life.
But encompass quick supply with the trade union in a complicated manner and for the objective causes.
One of the main - unusual fluidity of the frames.
Dissentient
The noisy protests took place in this day and at a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
Culmination of the share has been the next to the Times-public garden on which several local politicians-democrats appeared in the middle of day "Makdonaldsa" has the meeting in particular the member of the town Soviet Dzhumejn Williams that has declared: "Makdonalds" says that he sells billions of portions, and after it he even didn't give a hospital to you and don't pay to you for honest work"!.
Also the different eminent New York democrats the, for example candidate for an office of the mayor of the city Bill de Blasio that has declared that "we must together enter a support of the employees of quick supply with the fact that they have attained just payment and the economic well-being which each New Yorker deserves" have supported the demonstrators!.
As New York Times have characterized having happened it was the largest share of such a kind in the history of an American sphere of quick supply.
But in her participated only several hundreds of people, in which besides far not all of them were the employees of quick public catering borrowed, there are tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether as long as it is unclear this spark will generate flame of mass movement.

"So far to deceive the brain turns out so-so"
In the last time it is accepted to perceive the theme of supplemented reality, popular among the admirers of modern technologies, in the main thing across a prism of the special spectacles.
Have shown the model, at first in summer at one's yearly conference active, to Google, and then in November became known that had submitted application of a proper patent also to Microsoft.
It however follows that for the scientists of the given company the points are passed phase the talk with the leader of a group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharamom Izadi.
Perspective of manipulation with the virtual objects in air of the naked arms, creation of virtual open spaces beckons them.
-Tell, please, in the common lines with what your research group deals?
-We deal with interaction between a person with the machines, but we in this case try to space the boundaries of this interaction.
So far the mankind in mass stuck at the phase of the work on pixels on the plane screen, occasionally *addressing_in_rude_manner* in them by the finger.
We want to peep for 5-10 years ahead and guess drastic changes of this interaction.
The, for example prefix of Xbox and sensors Kinect is step ahead, and Xbox esteem not one today, without Kinect don't sell oneself for the gestural control is everything interesting.
-What else expects us ahead?
-Notwithstanding the fact that Kinect has transfered interaction on the physical level hitherto happen on the plane screen, occasionally much into 3D.
A withdrawal input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and so far not very.
We try to change it, we work on the truly three-dimensional systems of reflection in a base of different technologies, including of projective.
It is necessary to let out the computer world into us, physical, make him more palpable.
It is however necessary for it to recognize not only a user, but space around him.
Then we shall be able to supplement the real world with the virtual objects in a much more comfortable form.
And primarily - to hell these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
-What do you think about the vocal control?
A popular piece, but isn't she overestimated?
-Definitely to name him panacea - a question of privacy stands because one not always wants to notify others about the actions and intentions is impossible.
In fact all kinds of interaction with the computers are good, but each in their niche.
For example for the control of the devices in the public places we had the project in the frames of which we thought about gestures, but not sweeping, but so stingy, short.
In this case gestures were removed not to a chamber of the device, but the wrist bracelet which fixed movements of the bones and the muscles.
As long as he is large, but theoretically to reduce him to the size of the wrist hours is possible.
But in general the future rests with mixed type of the control, for example zhest+golos.
-It as?
-For example as will you ask me to convey this jar of fizzy water to you?
You will say and you simultaneously will show.
-I usually just speak.
-It on this will be very complicated to recognize.
-Do i.e. you want to make the users adapt oneself what can, or cannot the machine for a given moment?
-This reciprocally drawing together, but is quite optional.
I think, in the near future we in the main thing shall have to work on the development of new types of the sensors which will allow more precisely defining of the person's reactions.
It can be the, for example laser sensors, they give quite good permission in depth, it is very important.
-If one speaks your work on the sensors Xbox you have the which is Kinect complaints about the modern chambers?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth or else anything?
The present generation - is in a principle one, is to to which possible push off in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, well obtain mega pixels by 8 with speed 1000 to/ of the sec..
But an affair not in mega pixels, and as a matrix also the depth themselves.
From the last viewpoint all present technologies are us insufficiently good - it adds works for the designers of the algorithms.
It is i.e. necessary to remember not only about Z permission over the axes X and Y, but.
The speed of the number of frames per second is also very important.
Enough for the person's movement is dynamic, and the present 30 to/, it from is frankly a bit too small especially for gestures.
Steven Betishes from our Redmondskoj laboratory has made a sensor of touch the adjusted delay of treatment - from 1 to 100 ms, and the modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) index.
Not everybody understands to what extent it influences interaction between a person and the machines.
The equivalent of such a device, only not requiring touches that the frames per second were more, in my work would prove useful to me very much.
-And to increase the number of chambers is not necessary?
-Into Kinect now is, of which three "cameras", are one in fact - the infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of a reflected signal.
And the here already third chamber -, properly speaking, is a common sensor of visible range.
She doesn't apply for definition of the depth of the object.
The potentially *greater* number of chambers would be able to solve a problem…
Or aggravate her increasing the necessary volume of calculations.
It would be quite good to create flexible analog Kinect, poigrat'sya with curvature, how it will help to see, dispositions of the chambers and in three-dimensional definition of a position.
-The as far as I remember, to Microsoft, unlike Google, didn't present public my spectacles.
Doesn't it seem that from a viewpoint of everyday use of technologies of supplemented reality the spectacles are one of the most promising platforms to you?
-I think: the, of course, all time to wake up holding a smartphone in the raised arms not very comfortably, but here what "passing" supplemented reality would be when on the basis of the cloudy platform you would be able to switch from the spectacles to a smartphone, projective display also further everywhere the steepest version.
The spectacles - very personal arrangement, their in it force (only you see the private things) and simultaneously the weakness - supplemented reality on the basis of the spectacles won't allow you to work on the virtual objects jointly with other people.
-We shall imagine for a minute that the manipulation with the virtual holographic objects in air is accessible not only to Tony Starku from "the Iron Person", but a simple mortal.
There is one problem on which the critics of such often indicate are ideas: there is no tactile recall!
The arms don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare on this call?
-In my lectures I often say that the supplemented reality is the seventh breakthrough in succession in interaction between a person and a machine.
The I think eighth addition of the tactile feelings quite can become.
So far one of the interesting tricks is use of the second arm as a peculiar undercoat for an image.
She excellently registers pressing!
But there are also technologies which indeed are directed on addition "to here these pictures in air" of tangibility -, for example the interference of several directional ultrasound rays in a definite point where the finger, is, a feeling, gives, but so far it is very weak - like to you have blown on the hassocks.
There are also bracelets on the wrists which influence for nervous completions in the fingers - the too promising direction.
-And did you try to deceive the brain?
To make him think that he feels the fact that, does it seem, have to feel at that moment, when it sees anything?
-Here it is good idea, we haven't tasted yet to so make.
Here lurks one more task one over which is in for fighting else long - how make a person, physically being in very limited space, come to believe that he walks over open, practically infinite - we work and over the concepts of race tracks (quite not such as in the clubs), the moving platforms, as well as the huge balls.
As long as deceive the brain turns out so-so works, more very for many years.
Here what does the work on virtual reality of such, attractive to a researcher - many things in the absolutely rudimentary state.

Lack of objective criteria is instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" *CONTINUE* *PROJECT1* "Petersburg *VANGUARD*", *DEDICATE* *TOWNSPEOPLE*, *WHICH1* *BE* ahead, at the *CUT1* edge *CULTURE1* and *ART1*.
There is a given top list in the grass-snake the bright workers, whose achievements the scenes of Petersburg go out beyond the frames of the city often finding confession in Europe passing All-Russian fame burn *art*-.
The new hero "of Rosbalta" is scandalizing artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - the bearded person dressed into still red who occurs sometimes at the Russian museum, and sometimes the Summer garden, has one on the fashionable gatherings and exhibitions.
The pictures of Kirill Miller always gather the crowds of the spectators where they wouldn't expose themselves.
Kirill Miller is one of the particularly Petersburg social-philosophic tale-tellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller - it is a bright person of Petersburg vanguard of the end of the 80th is beginnings of the 90th.
Besides that he is a person of the city, by his appearance in the streets evoking smile at the townspeople, raising all mood.
He has recently taken a piano-organ and has become the Petersburg organgrinder into the arms for have matured for this complicated role whole his Bohemian existence, philosophy and an image.
-Kirill, and why do you nevertheless go around the city in everything red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
-I have chosen red colour as a designer, dealing with the kind and an image.
In this world red colour is compromise between the artist, imidzhmejkerom and a society.
Although there is everything that is slightly not gray in the society cause aggression and excitation of an unkind property.
But my provocations are directed on the fact that a talk has begun.
The whole history of my provocative actions is invitation to discussion.
-And when you understood that you must be an artist?
-On exhibition in the club Neva where my works were exhibited.
I have understood that it is my way.
Then the wave of the old free unofficial artists passed, and, new, free a fellow me true stories are unclear.
I have begun to be on the friendly terms with with the artists of the new wave, from postgazonevshchinoj which has brought to "Pushkin-,the 10", also larger wave wasn't.
I throw to a theatre, the clothes, music, into all genres, except a word.
-And all of it has united in your Art clinic… - it was important for Me to find oneself at the center of culture of Petersburg where all the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995 I occupied the territory, on Pushkin-10, and there, as long as repair, wasn't existed the musical-artistic club, the Bohemian club, the house of Petersburg Bohemia.
Many there were: born the nomes, I remember, as a Cord have brought Tekila jazz with the project "van Gogh's Ear".
The cord and his friends sang easy songs under plywood, they were in covering the pants, there was fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin among them.
When the group began to play *alive* she has become "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was a host of many programmes before khali-galivskikh times.
We have given Trakhtenberga to them, and his great career, has gone, and the basic education and upbringing he has received from us.
A gallery "D. 137", the club "Griboedov is aftersounds from Art-a clinic.
There our employees and the haunters have gone away.
I am a hero of yesterday's century, when culture meant something.
The polling was in 2000 in the press, the prize was "the People of our city".
In nomination "Artist of the year" I was named, my culmination has ended.
To work, I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the last century, in new times over the old rules is comfortless.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and the popularity divide, it is possible to be popular, but not very cultural.
-A recognizable fashion is inherent in your works.
-Many my pictures are the hits, relevance, by them brightly expressed, and is sharpness.
I shall have programme exhibition, "the Russian museum in the clowns".
The clowns are timeless category.
I earlier was social, now to be such - it is sick is also fearful.
But in the clowns everything gets smeared, the tragism films.
I like grotesque, I have sanserif ideas.
For example rescue of the world by a totalitarian disguise in the order order.
Over *clothes* is now met orientating oneself to external mechanics, and not an internal person.
And, maybe, to to him give the hand is impossible and to into erysipelas spit is necessary.
And the deception will be removed with the help of a disguise.
-And we have recently seen you in a role of an urban organgrinder - the Cultural city must have such a hero.
Who as not me, them must be.
-Well can, and can the commercial art be beautiful?
-Now commercial art must be accurate, tactful sweet course.
Disintegration of cultures takes place.
The people were earlier beaten at the flocks, Bohemia liked, one, the simpletons, are other.
Everybody has now broken into the micro communities, now everybody with difficulty will like.
I am not one hundred dollar scrap of paper to please everybody.
It now is necessary to think whom will please.
100 admirers' now at each cult hero each.
-And Stasa Mikhaylov comes on in several thousand!
-On him come broshenki, there sex-social sphere works.
And on cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 thousand won't come, and there is a less management, money, everything withers away in the total.
I have the admirers, it is the main thing not to deceive them, not spoil acquired.
I in adolescence painted such pictures that they hung the wall next to Falck and Larionov at one collector.
I have begun with the pictures in which is usually finished.
Notions are often now confounded.
Spiritual culture, culture of consumption are told:.
No culture is, at consumption, it from the other opera.
I am a person of yesterday culture, have grown on the examples of the artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, declined money for the sake of drawing of the pictures.
I am for such here a culture.
-Kirill, enough what for Petersburg there isn't?
-The good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: the official from culture.
But not each of them can deal with culture.
With the correct Tsars everything not so was, reign maybe, wasn't understood in culture very much, but they understood that it was necessary to hold the correct experts.
Now there are the good counselors here in Moscow.
With us in Petersburg the people are, which could to be the experts, but they shut, for the higher experts who correctly will estimate these experts and will give a road to them are necessary.
Now vkusovshchinka prospers.
The same Erarta, but distinguish them, other museums who they honestly say that we receive not the whole modern art are such artists must look for ourselves for the fact that.
-What such for you is Petersburg?
-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, in Moscow cultures are much larger, there soil is.
And the on our stones art grow finds it hard.
Cultural soil is for us necessary, and with us the writers now are more than the readers, it is wrong.
Which here in Europe many asking people go on exhibitions, the concerts very much.
With us this layer is thin.
It is for us necessary to make fashionable art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is realized on means for the grant from St. Petersburg

To bear in space
Ground is in danger.
Globally warming or collision with an asteroid-murderer.
The caravans of the spaceships with the Earthmen on a board depart in search for a spare planet.
Does the main question to save the mankind stand as continue its kind in the conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think that the choice is small.
The in fact real planets are only two is to which possible master at least hypothetically.
"It is Venus and is Mars" -, senior scientific worker of the State astronomical institute of the name of P.. K.. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin believes.
But if there are the conditions, more suitable for life, on Mars then on the surface of Venus - the temperature of 500 degrees.
To live is possible only at great height or on Venus'… orbit in space.
One has begun to approach the questions of reproduction in space with the flora.
Experiments with the plants were half a century ago yet carried out.
Four generations of the pea, grown on an orbit, didn't differ in anything from their earth sorts.
Sweat - deduction on an orbit of the insects, the tiny fruit flies-drosophilas.
In 1979 the quails' eggs to space sent to check how the embryo in the conditions of weightlessness develops.
We receive on an exit of the absolutely normal nestling.
And the problem here further begins.
The "one's to also begin to move -, explain, is the problem, connected with the fact that this nestling must find a support, it must rise to, the legs", head of the laboratory of the Institute of the medical-biological problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev.
Not finding a support the nestlings disorderly somersaulted.
And the full atrophy of instincts in 10 hours happened at the newborns.
The nestlings didn't react to light and a sound.
And there the trouble was in the fact that in four days they were just killed.
"The also two times we goggled nestlings after it have refused, because it is just impossible there to with them work" -, Vladimir Sychev states a failure of experiment with the nestlings in space.
With the animals the last time the biological "mini ark" flew to an orbit 16 years ago.
In spring experiments will continue the years 2013.
However there will be only the unisexual individuals on the bio satellite "Bion".
Experiment with the rats who were sent to space already with a fruit was.
Nothing supernatural in a principle there hasn't been detected.
"It has just been on the bio satellites, but it, again -, it is necessary to carry - out unitary experiment, also such investigations", Vladimir Sychev notes.
The posterity after a landing has appeared at the space rats.
But one so far cannot approach the problem of breeding immediately in space.
Not a simple task.
The animals losing just cannot realize the habitual habitat own instinct is the waiter.
The person unlike the little animals in a principle can.
The Homo Sapiens possesses an abstract mind, and able to create proper emotional background.
Experiments, in ethical considerations similar, aren't carried out.
But the women fly already 50 years to space.
*Tereshkova* had the greatest risk.
And most precious, which the mankind, has, is the female body.
Our Seagull has flown away, and nobody on the earth would be able to say: whether it will remain after a flight to space.
She will manage to bear a child after this flight.
"However nobody answered - with this question", a veteran of space missile branch *Vakhtang* Vachnadze speaks.
In June of the year, 1964 whole in a year after a flight to space the first woman-astronaut Valentine Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
Father of Andriyan child Nikolaev also was an astronaut.
In 1988 the son to the second woman-astronaut Svetlana Savickaya that has twice visited an orbit and has even worked in open space was born.
However the risk remains.
We have the unit is few exist the astronauts at whom after the prolonged flights everything has managed, and a healthy generation grows.
"And if more, then it is dangerous even in the orbital flights", - the space pilot, the Hero of the Soviet Union, leads up a total in Hera to Russia of *VALERIA* Polyakov.
And it is nevertheless for the mankind necessary to look for some new ways in biotechnologies, protection against radiation, creation of artificial gravitation.
The hydro laboratory of the Astronaut Training Center is the obligatory phase of preparation for a flight.
Here in the conditions of zero floatation the astronauts work off skills in work in open space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If, is water, although also comfortable for adult but nevertheless alien medium then for the sucklings - the native element.
Small ikhtiandry like confirm - that the life has gone out from ocean to the land.
There is connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months at the mom into the okoplodnoj liquids, he finds it easier to get accustomed afterwards to water.
It is in a principle logical, because from a moment of birth, from a moment of that first bathe pass in all 2 weeks.
"It that something is very few that to forget" -, instructor of suckling swimming Marina Aksenova speaks.
In a word, gravitation, gravity if for a born child weightlessness is the more natural state then for a woman - are necessary.
Very quickly the muscles of the belly, the pelvis in weightlessness become senescent, an ability in pushing out of a fruit decreases.
We well OK shall lower also it relying upon the stimulators of generic activity.
It is possible, of course, in a special chamber to go on the kinds, she will push him out.
"And what - ask the nontrivial questions of *VALERIA* Polyakov is further".?
Artificial gravitation on the other hand is for a child too necessary.
Not feeling earth attraction the body won't form the skeleton and a muscular system.
It is impossible as an adult to dress the newborn on an orbit in the special load suit for trainings.
He just will be deprived of the fact that for him it will be vitally necessary.
"And this experiment, on which we with you shall go the allowing of birth of the child in an allogenic medium will result in the fact that we shall bring an invalid to the earth completely dezadaptirovannogo the person" - the head of a committee for bioethics IMBP of the Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov foresees.
As long as the birth of the children in space is a question of theory.
However after the time it will be reality, when the Earthmen will depart by its ships to the far planet which will become a house for their descendants, born in space.

A head of the Main test-revisional control: the Checkup of the Schwarz system has fallen through over the politicians' guilt.
In a branch of the state purchases Czechia has the good organs of the control and, notwithstanding the presence of quality legislation at its disposal, lags behind its application.
This declaration of *Miroslav* of *FAECES*, the vice-president of the supreme test-revisional administration from an interview for the site Aktualne.cz.
"The law will never be ideal, but it must correctly, in my opinion there isn't - enough for us which, has commented on the current situation of *FAECES*, apply".
Joint inspection of the Czech and German organs of the control grants the similar conclusions.
An approach of Peter Nechasa to the so named Schwarz system as an example of wrong practice is led.
Has recently the prime minister declared, what GDP (the Civil democratic party) won't worry the businessmen with the checkups - it goes out forbidden or resolved?
"The law should be in any set way, and if it forbids, anything then also the prime minister cannot oppose to the work of the institutions, to which is imputed duty to check and demand execution of obligations" - state, *FAECES*.
At a session of the revisional committee in the deputies' Chamber you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German sides in the frames of which the legislation on the state purchases of both countries was juxtaposed.
About what specifically did the matter concern?
It is meant that the parallel checkup which we have begun probably, two years ago.
More simply speaking, about the fact that European legislation asserts speech, in what way have to study, the state purchases, are further, also an application in practice follows national legislation and afterwards.
The whole information was acquired also even in an else unfinished checkup, have transpired interesting differences - more simply speaking the legislation with us can be "the precise and unerring", however in a practician of an application we in some parameters are inferior to Germany.
It follows that it is insufficient to create still more, and more are the precised rules, it is necessary to concentrate on an application of law itself it.
And can the properly how given project help you, what does he mean for you?
Just such a joint control can make a contribution to the efforts in a stop of rectification of laws, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it doesn't lead to positive result.
The economy means reception of a proper thing for fair (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and, perhaps, criminal behaviour.
But it is not the fact that we shall reach it decreasing a restriction on the orders.
Perhaps this system will overflow "the papers" so that ones who will wish to find loop-holes in a given system will find them much lighter than if the restriction hasn't gone down.
You speak the internal problems of a practical application of legislation on the state purchases.
And how does the system of the control in Germany function?
Does such an organization as us of Crewe (the Test-revisional control) exist there, or does it work otherwise?
What concerns the institutions one there acts as as our Crewe, Bundesrechnungshof, is made according to our principle, the board, working a little differently, also exists, but in the main thing both institutions function similarly.
Besides that the authorities are before the definite degree similar, but there since Germany has a federal structure, one there are subdivisions of an audit and at the level of the federal lands - in it their system somewhat differs from us.
BRH can control only federal money, we have state means at our disposal.
The public funds in our regions and the municipalities are monitored at the level of the federal audit chambers.
What concerns local legislation there more simply than at us?
In general I wouldn't want to compare without particular data, but in some relation to take Germany behind a sample, but it is impossible to definitely say that it is better in everything is possible.
Is it so, because they better cope with the control?
Definitely isn't, but I shall be repeated, similar to me comparisons don't please.
But it is necessary to say that even the exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise wouldn't they gain any advantage from cooperation with our office probably?
If speak internal legislation then how has one been reflected on your institution of a correction of a Law of the state purchases, in any way are consequences manifested?
Taking into account that the legal force of these corrections is enough short she in any way yet hasn't been manifested in our works on the control.
For we conduct the control over a fact it is necessary to take some delay into account.
We take it into account only in a process of preparation of the future checkups - we have begun to use our new instrument "detection of unthrift risk" across which we have passed almost 14000 state contracts We have analyzed them There, of course, these changes will be manifested, because the restrictions, change, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on vary.
How do you count the assertion this law will bring benefit or the additional load of a system of a bureaucracy?
I think that this law certainly is step in a correct direction, and, I hope, it will be confirmed.
The problem which can arise is such that the rules "will toughen", and it will be impossible to observe them.
The enterprises, in functioning of the previous rules monitored, are bound with a supplier (for example, the regional operative programmes - with regional advice) in the fact that any nonobservance of a law of the state purchases means violation of budget discipline.
Stand in such an opportunity to toughen a law in such a way?
What I think in not this way.
The system must exclude ones who want to capture and abuse, but not punish ones who make a formal mistake, not influencing a solution.
Such a system only will create the some more *greater* pressure on a bureaucracy.
And whereas go out from this situation?
Let us realize that this way nowhere won't bring.
Has recently the prime minister declared that GDP won't worry the businessmen with the checkups of the so named Schwarz system, What does it mean?
Is "the Schwarz system" forbidden or resolved?
The law should be in any set way, and if it forbids, anything then also the prime minister cannot oppose to the work of the organs to which is imputed duty to check and demand execution of obligations.
It is possible to say: "We shall change this law and we shall resolve it", but it is impossible to say that will pretend, as if nothing happened.
The law of the state purchases contains the enough obligatory rules as also what must be formally conducted, and it, correctly It will protect the state purchases.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of the formal shortcomings.
The law will never be ideal, but it must correctly, in my opinion there isn't enough for us which, apply.

The fast highway R6 and the roads of the first class in the region currently are passable without the restrictions.
Attentiveness is however necessary, for example on the bridges where the surface can be having frozen over and slippery.
Also all roads, relating to the second and third class of including the mountain routes, are passable.
But the remains of snow that has frozen and by the places worn out all else lie on their some areas.
It is especially for attentive necessary to be on the roads, situated on heights.
Pardubitskij and a Kralovegradetskij edge
The control of the roads and the highways of Czechia on one's pages on the Internet inform that some roads of the eastern Czechia threatens ice-slick, and on the mountain roads and the roads, situated on heights, can, a worn out layer of snow is found.
The regional road workers warn the drivers of the ice-slick which can be formed especially on heights Pardubitskogo of the edge.
Ice-slick can be near Lanshkrouna Usti-super-Orlitsi Polichki, Svitavi or Visoke-Mito especially on the roads of the second and the third class.
The roads I/ 43 also I/ 34, situated at Svitavi, processed the chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads *Krk* burden and Orlitskikh of the mountains.
The worn out layer of snow is on the roads, situated on heights in districts Rikhnova-super-of Knezhnou and Trutnova.

Shimon Ornest: On the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that the end of light must begin less than in a month?
It-is only one of the many alarming news, on which we, the people, so easily *come_across*.
Together with a group of The Tap Tap we permanently joke on this theme and we say that we are the sole group in the world which will be able to assemble sufficiently positive energy to defer or prevent the end of light.
More than that in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts are against the end of light.
Would you be able more in more detail to tell about it the readers?
The matter concerns about the nationwide action of collection of means which we plan here already during two years.
We have decided to use the marketing potential which a calendar of the Maya on the end of which announced on 21 December into 11: 10 possesses.
In a day before this event, the 20th December in 21: 00 three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava parallelly start.
They will end, roughly speaking, at that moment, when there is an hourly zone of which on the island of *Kiribati* in the Pacific ocean, 12 hours earlier than at us, the May calendar will finish.
For whom has this idea come to the head?
Primordially it was my idea, we further invented everything together with our artist Gonzoj Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to accumulate sufficiently positive energy and prevent the end of light we also want together with a community to think over in what state we once shall convey this world to our children.
On the occasion of completion of the May calendar we have created unique collection of the items the footwear, the sport shirts, the bags and the original keys against the end of light, to buy These things on the site www.e-tap.cz and by that together show a support to us is possible.
The group of The Tap Tap has together with other musicians also executed anthem against the end of the light which is called "the End of light is canceled".
Will sound the anthem on these benefit performance concerts, having already liked the listeners YouTube?
Of course, at the very end if in a total everything turns out, and the end of light won't begin.
All performers on all concerts will begin to sing him simultaneously.
Anthems simultaneously will sound also in live broadcast of Czech television.
The words to this song has written and has played Jesus' role in a clip Tomasz Ganak, X participate in execution also of Xindl…
How have you begun to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life, since we take many charitable actions and the concerts.
We try actively to switch them to these projects.
It has turned out that many like with us to work, are interesting to them.
On what help from a concert against the end of light will go?
On a purchase of the equipment bezbar'ernogo the educational center STUDEO, the already sixth year we so work with civil union Tap in Edlichki institute.
The teachers regularly visit the students of the schools of Edlichki institute and take cheerful and interesting actions with them.
The students themselves haven't means to depart to the teachers, and we try in such a way to grant this possibility to them.
The building into which we shall move with this project within the framework of the project of an additional construction of Edlichki institute will arise separately in the future.
On each concert several musical groups and the performers will come forward.
What were criteria for selection?
We tried to be the programme which will attract all generations of including the children.
For example in Prague will appear Chinaski Support Lesbiens Illustratosphere from Danom *Bart* The Tap Tap, Mar'yan Bango and Irzhi is Dry.
To all details find out on the site www.kpks cz is possible.
Do you plan any similar "grandiose actions" in the future?
In May will appear for the first time on festival "Prague spring" and we here, of course, shall prepare an interesting programme with the interesting guests.
In the next year we with pleasure would give performance in a Czech national house in New York, and I personally, already if we are in the USA, would want to appear in Washington and Chicago very much.
About the foreign countries with you the serious plans, you have already appeared in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group of The Tap Tap is a group of the people with the limited possibilities.
How do you cope with a road from a viewpoint of the organization and logistics??
It is not so fearful, as seems on the first glance.
With us five participants on the electric invalid carriages, their carriages must journey in the baggage section, in addition of everything are the large quantity of the cargo and the boxes with the instruments.
Nevertheless, as long as the Czech airlines CSA coped with it without the problems, and British airlines British Airways always perfectly are prepared for true story for us what me how much once amazed.
Even in Moscow from where we have recently returned everything went without the problems.
Due to departures abroad you can compare the different countries from a viewpoint of availability, the attitude of the community to the invalids and so on.
What did you face to the present moment?
After Madrid, Luxemburg, London and other countries where everything functions better than at us, in Russia we have become the witnesses of the fact that in the east everything else is at the basic level.
The independent movement of the person on an electric invalid carriage at the center of the city in comparison with Prague in Moscow, very many barriers, are also here still is into wonder some more.
Not in run such banal things as concede a road to an invalid in a lift are also there.
The public organizations which try to pay attention of the people to the problems of the people of the limited possibilities fortunately arise also there already.
And with what, permanently must conversely we catch up with the advanced countries?
Very many things is the level of execution of which far behind are.
But it is important to precise that the improvement and the improvement of a situation always depend on the efforts of those people whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid it is quite normal that the people with a heavy form of disability independently move in the streets, can come down to a toilet, to a museum, yes where *please*…
The fact that the large number of people with the limited possibilities takes active part in public life, we outpace them with The Tap Tap a little it there is not very widespread!
Respect to a community or bezbar'ernost' is one thing, but at a moment, when among us will appear the known sportsmen, the artists, the actors, the politicians or the lawyers, then everything also really will begin to change.
As long as it is the unitary cases - the people with strong will.
The group of The Tap Tap currently is very popular, but shall we return for two years back, what in 1998 made you organize her?
I have entered Edlichki institute as an educator, there were many young people who wanted to start to deal with something around me.
And since me the musician himself and I play including and on a saxophone, the interesting musical circlet has together with a colleague organized that.
Well, and with the time, as our host speaks, Making ready this Angelovich, a little have got out of the control (laugh).
Did the popularity come only in the last years, or do I confound anything?
It is truth, the fact that we have begun to join the famous singers and actively work on a propaganda of a group has helped us.
We have drawn a conclusion that the work which nobody can estimate in essence like exists.
Due to means for the European union we can allow ourselves the skilled teachers, the equipment and so on.
Did the aim so well to promote The Tap Tap face you?
From the very beginning I felt their potential in an ability to make something unusual.
In Shaw-business is full of augural, imitating each other.
It is logical, everything new begins with caution, and lasts for it long.
Very few rare things, but I shall dare to say that Tap Tap is alone exist from them.
The first impression with the person who sees us, of course, pity, it is natural…
But this pity is perfectly excessive, because the people with the limited possibilities don't appear any suffering and all abandoned personalities which we must grudge.
They are the people who can live full-fledged life and develop, of course, only provided they possess the necessary resources.
I say that if the people with disability something can it is shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Has the fact that you are the strict leader to which you many believe insured success?
If we want to do work qualitatively we must be in many things uncompromising and hold definite discipline.
But I believe that it is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic presentation and fly in the clouds, and when it is found, out that two times per week are they have to go on rehearsals to attend preparatory courses and spend much time in a road, the enthusiasm is very quickly lost.
But so happen in any group which wants to work and reach something.
The current in composition of the group of The Tap Tap 20 people.
How much they were at the beginning in 1998?
Only alone Making ready Angelovich.
We are an open group, the people come and go away, to prevent it is impossible.
For ones who have a wish and the force of will our doors always are opened.
He will take place up to the expected end of light, on Thursday 20.12.2012 into 21 00 in a day.
The concert will take place in Prague at stadium Incheba, to Brno - in the club Fleda and Ostrava - at the center of Plynojem with participation of 12 groups and other musicians of Czechia.
In termination of a concert all three cities are bound the TV bridge at a moment of execution of song of the group of The Tap Tap "the End of light is canceled".
The aim of the given project - gather financial means in volume is 25 million crowns on a purchase multifunctional bezbar'ernogo of the equipment of the educational center STUDEO at the institute of Edlichki in Prague.
The ticket for a concert costs 400 crowns, for the children before 12 years the free entrance, to acquire the Tickets beforehand into Bohemiaticket is possible.

Poland and space.
In the last week at a session of the ministers of the European space agency Poland was received by the twentieth member of the European space agency as the second country from the countries of the former eastern block (after Czechia which became a full-fledged member of the European Space Agency on 12 September 2008).
Poland has begun close cooperation with the European Space Agency in 1994 and during the subsequent years has taken active part in the row of the projects of an agency.
But Poland has begun the way to space much earlier.
Before the Second world war yet the Polish enthusiasts dealt with the trips to space, but not always it met understanding.
I shall resemble, for example about a lecture by A.. Sternfeld who on 6 December 1933 represented in the Warsaw astronomical observatory of idea from my innovative work "Introduction astronautics".
The ideas of a young engineer (the yr 1905 of river) have left an audience for indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recollected that only doctor Jan Gadomskij had been interested in his work.
In the year 1934 in France Sternfeld won a prize of Robert Esno-Pel'tri and Andre Louis Khirsha for "Introduction astronautics".
Doctor Jan Gadomskij (1899 - 1966) about whom was told higher has later become the great propagandist of astronomy and astronautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in the Polish magazines and has written the row of the books, dedicated by it to scientific disciplines.
Gadomskij has become the known world propagandist of astronautics, and his contribution was estimated including by the fact that one of the craters on a reverse side of the Moon was named in its honour.
Already in the year 1925 in Poland the railway railcar, equipped with the rocket engine, was built.
Regretfully the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as also a detail on the project.
It is not clear whether even, for acceleration or for braking of a wagon the rocket had to be used.
Information on this railcar is known only from the press of that epoch.
The Polish artillery has begun with 1933 to ponder the rocket arrows.
The Section on technique of armament in cooperation with professors Mechislavom Vol'fke and Gustavus Mokzhitskim realized investigation.
One from the materials that have remained can see that investigations have reached before the stage of the practical tests.
But with coming of the German troops works were interrupted.
The idea of the photo-electric rocket-destroyer which the *Rogozin* engineer has proposed, and in the next year the work "the Air rocket-torpedo and the aviation rocket-bomb" of author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotskogo went out in 1937 appeared in specialized print.
Both projects were developed for military use of the rocket engines.
The Temporary scientific-consultative committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) which coordinated the whole work before war itself dealt with all projects of military use of rocket engineering.
The committee was formed in 1937, but the work has ended after two years of its activity because of the beginning of war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to astronautics, appeared in the Polish press after a war, due to the work of the Polish society of astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
1954 years of the magazine "of a Problem" in which four volumetric articles on astronautics are published for the first time are mentioned in November number about a society.
In one of them professor M Subotovich has proposed to found the society which will deal with astronautics.
In that time the projects of the artificial satellites already grew, and it was clear that space investigations were a promising branch.
From the beginning of 1956 the Polish society of astronautics (POA) tried to enter the international federation of astronautics (based in 1951), and in already autumn POA became her actual member.
And in the next year the first chairman POA Kazimezh Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became a deputy of the chairman of the International federation of astronautics.
He remained on this job before most his death which has come in 1959.
Since the year 1956 POA have made a significant contribution to the development of the tremendously successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) which has become the first Polish rocket that has executed scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launching has taken place 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of overcoming the distance of 1800 metres, was into the length about 80 centimetres, and its weight equalled less than 5 kilograms.
Hereafter the improved version RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 the tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2 were given on the Bledovskom vacant plot.
This rocket was into the length about 1,4 metres, and its weight equalled about 11,5 kilograms.
The next version of the rocket was even able to do the present scientific work - the rocket RM-34 could overcome 14,5 kilometres, and observation of the high altitude wind was its task.
But in 1962 farther development was suspended.
A rocket Meteor-1, developed in a period between 1962 and 1965 years, has become the heiress of the first rockets of type RM.
The rocket was conceived as two-stage, its common length equalled 510 centimetres, and the initial weight is 32,5 kilograms.
Three types, (designated as a Meteor-,1A 1V and-1S) which differed in the size of the chamber for the scientific equipment were developed.
The rocket Meteor-1A had space of the volume of 0,4 liters at its disposal, the Meteor-1V is 0,34 liters, and the Meteor-1S - 0 62l.
The maximum range of the flight at all three types was 37 kilometres.
In a period between 1965 and 1968 the years in the Aviation institute took place the development of a rocket Meteor-2, and its first flying tests have begun in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 with the starting weight of 380 kilograms was capable of deducing a useful cargo of the weight 10 kilograms on the height about 60 kilometres.
Then the versions Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is worth mentioning also about entry of Poland into KOSPAR (the Committee for space investigations) in the year 1960 and creation of the national committee KOSPAR two years later.
Besides that there is Inter space within the framework of the programme, Poland participated in investigations to space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot *Miroslav* Germashevskij became the second inter astronaut after Vladimir Remeka.

The cancellation of a law of public works is not a solution of a problem.
In the last week the constitutional court annuled a law of public works.
The decree has caused lively discussion in a society.
It surely will be interesting to glance at given problem range from a wider viewpoint.
The liberally-oriented economic systems in EU also as also in the globalized world are based on the principle of a plural, unregulated economic competition.
In essence it means that the separate economic subdivisions, the national economic systems are in a permanent conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and movement, to free anything not restricted, of the private capital together with ungovernable financial speculation.
Price tension arises as a result of considerable difference in the cost of the workforce (salary).
Is by this notion necessary to understand state, when the producer by delivery of cheap goods tries to withstand in an economic competition by the fact that the competitor's cost "knocks down" with aim to take away oneself the large part of a market and, thus, increase the own income.
Either the transfer of production abroad, or the cheap purchases abroad, or the disappearance As a result increases, the unemployment in ones in the countries, where, in comparison with other, the cost of the workforce, is is high in the mass scale means it for the businessmen's majority.
Since the private capital doesn't bear any social responsibility, including and behind produced by him unemployment unavoidable expenses of the state for social needs grow.
On the whole the situation reinforces unwillingness of Messr businessmen to pay taxes and with that *MOST* compensate public economic and social damage, caused them in a chase of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give particular statistical data.
The unceremonious methods of the private capital create at the level of economies of the separate states of the situation, when the governments of the countries are forced enter a competition with each other to artificially decrease the social level of their population with a view on drawing in to a country of the foreign capital.
In other words the governments give back the own population on the tyranny to the private capital notwithstanding social degeneration.
It finds its reflection primarily in the changes of active legislation.
By aim own appears to economically make ??narod be subordinated to dictation of the private capital primarily in the region of salary.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in a case of prolonged unemployment and in the same time serves as an instrument for cutdown of rights of the employees in a sphere of labour legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty, and also the difference between the poor and rich increase together from by that.
Public distribution of products over the poor which are not able to support itself by own labour exists already several years in the Federal Republic of Germany.
The number of these people approaches a million already.
The cases, when the people, placed in a job, earn such a salary that the state must pay to them so that they receive the subsistence minimum permanently happen within the framework of an increase of competitivity of German economy.
The similar scandal has become known to a community also in a case of the additional employees of the Bundestag.
The economic measures practically in all southern states of EU, surely, in which results to the same state the people, being under the pressure of catastrophic fall of the social status forced or to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or exist on the backyards of the society in hope on beggarly salary what ever will come to the country, are private investment capital.
Is however asked from where he will originate?
If the capital comes from other countries of EU then poverty to move from one country into other, or he won't come in general, for a Chinese, the Hindu, the Brazilian, the Turk, the Moroccan, the Egyptian, the African still work any more for a share of European salary.
It concerns the whole Latin America.
The liberal theory and the mass media before nausea assert that the state cannot participate in the capital of own economy that the controllable economy conducts to an economic catastrophe.
The private capital steadily insists on the fact that the state must not with actions be mixed up by the managers with economy.
Is it necessary to answer with a question whether the private capital, now practically the manager don't act policy and of the themes most the entire state in own selfish aims further?
Unambiguous answer - yes.
Existence of the practically omnipotent and omnipresent lobbies in all states is the proof.
As result we have a hopeless situation, being manifested in corruption, the support of reciprocal profits, legislation where practically everything deserves punishment, however isn't crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany the situation is such that the state ministries because of a shortage of financial means entrust the private law firms which tightly are connected with an industry with the development of bills.
The Bundestag afterwards asserts these bills.
The whole power originates not from a people as the constitution of the western type, and from the financial-powerful groups, preferring own interests, says.
It is obvious that the liberally-oriented democracy now quickly turns out in such ??situatsii as this, Appianom in work "the Crisis of the Roman empire in days of Caesar and Pompeii": "the State disintegrates, already for a long time, and the departments deal with violence is described.
The bribes, illegal reception of mercies with the help of the stones and the swords.
The bribery and the corruption prospered without the versatile bans, and the people went on an election with the beforehand sold voice"…, "the honest people in general didn't run for the ruler's job, the state has once eventually remained without a consul "Earnestly, have begun, to speak that that the sole rescue in this awful situation is, autocracy and the necessity of a choice of the energetic person", Appian thought that it would be Pompeii, but Caesar, who has finally replaced democracy with autocracy has become him, for eight months".
Own reckless interests without consideration of public interests as also in antiquity, in a modern society prevail.
The private capital already in its essence isn't intended for an application in public aims.
The present result doesn't differ from the past: unparalleled degeneration of the elite without any endeavour to conduct reforms of the deeper character.
Mean a cause of appearance of fascist, and we must look for the communist regimes in reckless liberalization of the economic systems of 19 and 20 centuries.
As of today it is possible the absence of these regimes and existence of democracy of liberal type to perceive the definite pause after which the next tour is expected how.
The fact that the present elite completely ignores consequences into hundreds of the thousands of victims in the future the humanitarian and social catastrophes which we already now observe together with crimes are against of humaneness, how we know it from old and new history is primarily tragic.
The cancellation of a law of public works isn't not a solution or at least forever.
The government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for the ways for farther decrease in the social level of the population under the pressure of the competition in both international, and of the national and European levels.
The tendency, by such an image given, has the system character.
Special purpose political and social reforms which will allow strengthening of share participation of the state in economy, the citizens' role in the control of the state will reinforce and will loosen a monopolistic position of the private capital in a society in favour to the state are the solution.

Israel: the Laboratory of chaos.
"From violence nothing will be produced, and never Sting, can go - out" song "Fragile" where the main verse of refrain are the words: "we don't forget how we are fragile".
"If my sons didn't want wars, them, Gutel' Shnaper, wouldn't be" - dying wife Meera Amshela Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and sector Gaza, as always, has caused a set of the responses.
Some support Israel substantiating its position with the fact that it has right of self-defence, and the Palestinians come forward in the terrorists' role, other support the Palestinians substantiating it with racism of the Israeli state, genocide, accomplished over the Palestinian Arabs, and a role of the terrorist state is ascribed to the state of Israel.
I don't want to speculate on one who is in these waves of murders - the criminal, and who, being periodically repeated, the victim, eventually, today's citizens of Israel, of including the self controllable territories, have been born for a moment of the current political situation, and wasn't the witnesses have begun violence.
My aim - propose it to the readers to peep is behind a curtain look on whom primarily serve, tension (counting from signing of a Declaration of Balfour in November 1917), lasting for already 95 years, on the small area of ground of the Middle East.
Some of my reasonings is confirmed with the historical facts, some of them are removed on the base of my own understanding of one, who or what group of the people *BE* the main engine of the events of modern history.
The history of the mankind is primarily the history of struggle for the power.
We can find the same Alexander Velikogo or Napoleon in each epoch.
That it is not so clear whether whether always these people perfectly independently took their steps, or somebody, who directed their actions to beforehand planned aims stood behind their throne.
It is necessary to assume that we live in the period, when world wealth is concentrated, and, which this concentration of money and the power, ensuing from them, couldn't, happen in several persons' arms in life of one generation.
Some which could be considered as the head of the octopus, (I don't know, somebody over them, stands, but it isn't excluded) -, Rothschilds outstands among the astronomically rich families.
About them isn't written much.
Is understood.
They bought the first agency of news (Rejters) already in the 90th years of century, 19, to stop the rumours, connecting their name with criminal actions in the highest spheres, in shadow of which they were, and which always led to consolidation of their power, an increase of wealth or simultaneously and to that, and to other.
With them the large packages of the shares are almost in all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in whose central banks they haven't their share at their disposal, they lead or prepare a war (there were in all 7 countries before the intrusion Afghanistan, 5 countries, have become, remained, however in the same time the Russian government took only four after overthrow of Khaddafi, the central is a bank of their country into their arms after intrusion Iraq).
Any who tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln has refused to keep a status of the central bank behind Rotshil'dovskim Bank of America, during a civil war he has begun to produce own own (understand - governmental) money and was killed in the year 1865 in a theatre.
John F. Kennedy, produce own money and wanted beginnings FED (the federal reserve system) to cancel was killed in 1963 Deputy Louis Makfadden was poisoned in the year 1936 after wanted to give to a court on FED for untying of the Great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for the world power in a period from 1859 to 1871 years has brought to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great mason of the 33th level by Albert Pajkom.
The, with a task of the first war was destruction monarchic states in Europe, the second had to destroy colonial predominance of especially Great Britain, and the third must bring to reduction of the world population approximately up to 0,5-1 of a billion people (sufficiently the support of their comfort and luxury will be the such number of slaves, and they won't consume many resources), creation of integral universal religion (the ecumenism cannot be nothing else besides as a prerequisite of such a project) and a final capture of the absolute power.
A challenge of the crisis and subsequent offer of the solutions (order ab chao - the order from chaos) are the method with the help of which the group of the richest families, headed by Rothschilds, works.
But these solutions are false and always lead to deterioration of the situation (see the base FED which had to prevent repetition of a crisis, caused by them, in 1907).
Thus, after they have succeeded in unleashing the First world war by the murder of the Habsburg's heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo they have destroyed Tsarist Russia beginning bolshevik revolyutsiiyu.
The first world war has ended with abrupt, unfounded in military and economic relation by the capitulation of Germany (the necessity of a war for destruction of Tsarist Russia hasn't already been), breaking up with the central European state, Austro-Hungary, as consequence, has also happened.
For relief of untying of the Second world war the bankers and the politicians have created a concealed uncooperative situation putting huge military reparations what to Germany, has been created a prerequisite of radicalization of masses, then, further, to create multinational Czechoslovakia with by strong German minority, which is have to was to play, and have indeed played a function of the fifth column, in kindling of a fire of war remained only toss up the Germans sufficiently having got poor strong, the convicting of culpable and proposing the Leader's simple decisions.
At the end of the 19th century Rothschilds provoked a base for Zionist movement, of which one branch strove, to create the Jewish state, is preferable is in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned declaration of Balfour has created a prerequisite of the Jews' mass immigration to Palestine, the first collisions with the local Arab population have begun to happen.
The terrorist attacks happened from both sides.
The Second world war has flashed, it is difficult to estimate whether Hitler has escaped from the chains, in which primordially the bankers, kept him, or everything, that it has done, was planned in any case of suffering of the European Jews in the concentrative camps have been created the prerequisites of recognition of the Jewish state as the world community.
Israel was officially based in 1948 and, like that as Germany was provoked by military reparations to the 2th world war, the state of Israel was proclaimed to create focus of third war.
If the international bankers succeed in untying her, the Jewish people, as also in the second world war will become a victim of the military operations on a line of the front, now already together with the Arab or, more simply speaking by the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is the like gigantic laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside a country, but at the international level (take only sharp separation of the people into the partisans and the opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty, and who is a victim in a Palestinian-Israeli conflict where the resentment causes resentment in an infinite chain of violence if everything has begun with the individuals' greed and their aspiration the world power?
It here is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because the bankers, as also at us international, fob off for the people for a voting in the election of only the own candidates.
The present prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of fascist, loyal to the international bankers, the politician, making everything to start the war with Iran which due to membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization of cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan)… will threaten to develop into the world conflict, and taking the control of Iran of the *Hormuz* strait, containing 20 % of all world reserves of petroleum (the navigable corridor is only only 2 miles by the width) -, into account also will result in destruction of world economy.
In what light the words, said by David Rockefeller in 1994: "what is All for us necessary - it is a common crisis, and the people will receive the new world order" are now manifested.
The new world order in their idea is a world of the gentlemen and the slaves.
The world where the remaining part of the human population serves the handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
Consecration oil where the chip with which it becomes essence, being under the total control, is implanted for each born body in birth.
"And make everybody small and large, rich and the free beggars, and have the slaves, there is a stamp, on the right arm or so that there is the person who isn't marked with that beast's, name or number, couldn't his name on the forehead nor buy nor sell.
Here in what there is wisdom: each who has a mind, can calculate number of the beast.
For it corresponds to a human name, also this - number six hundred sixty six.

A film "the Operation "by Slang": When worse ????? where call Hollywood
In November 1979 the crowd of islamistic students-demonstrators captured the embassy of the USA in Teheran and has taken into 52 diplomats' hostages.
They had to be released in exchange for overthrown shah Mohammed Rezy *Pehlevi* that was running after a revolution in the USA which were a patron of his regime during the decades.
For the administration of the USA positive outcome of the situation wasn't supposed - she couldn't allow itself to throw out a shah behind a board, because in root it could shatter confidence of the allies in other countries.
However to reach a release of the hostages in Iran where the revolution has resulted in an establishment of a theocratic regime she was not able.
It was a blow at the prestige of the United States which later was reinforced with futile attempt to release the hostages by force.
The captive diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations in mediation of the government of Algeria.
Their destiny has caused a wave of solidarity and anti Iranian moods at home.
The lesion in Iran to a significant extent contributed to a defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of the 1980th year that has finished in the election of Ronald Reagan.
By actor Ben Afflekom "the Operation "of Slang" describes one of the episodes of that history which has brought America the small victories the film, srezhessirovannyj.
Six employees have shortly before an occupation of an embassy succeeded in running down.
After complicated peripeteias they have finished their way to residences of the embassy of Canada.
CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities has succeeded in taking them away from Iran, in this case has helped the extravagant legend of the cover according to which they have departed with the Canadian passports as the members of a shooting group that were looking about for a place for shooting of science fiction epic in a country.
Combination of the genres
The plan which an expert "on evacuation" of Tony Mendes has invented required cooperation of Hollywood.
So that the legend is certain, in the specialized magazines was written about the project of a film the press conferences were convened, the fictitious productional company had a real office.
The details on an operation stuck the long time in a secret, the film, based is on memoirs of Tony Mendesa.
Affleka film is special combination of several genres.
An on the one hand real political thriller, the so named "film-cine opus", the history of successful contrivance, fraud - the row of the films about friends Oushena can be the example.
In a film permanently vary moods - on the one hand documentary, the conceived scenes from Teheran (in the titles are the sign historical photographs of the events and that in what way the same situations were demonstrated in a film - of considerable differences in it isn't indicative).
The Hollywood excerpts, on the other hand facilitated, intersecting irony and moderate exaggeration.
And afterwards else a scene from the headquarters of CIA and other institutions - the men in the suits discuss a situation behind the tables of negotiations, on the ladders of the institutions, by a telephone…
Ben Affleku has remarkably succeeded in making the re take-off of career.
From a ridiculed actor have become a respectful director, also his game has stopped being an object of mockeries.
"An operation "of Slang" its third full-length film after dark detective story "Farewell the my own darling, farewell" (2007) and a thriller "City" (2010).
In the same time it is the Affleka first film which isn't shot in the native city of the director - Boston.
The emotion of the atmosphere of place in this case relates to the qualities which elevated the earlier films of the director over Hollywood standard.
And Afflek reveals it in "Slang" where Canada "plays" Teheran.
The best scenes happen in a film in the streets, in a reconstruction of the real events - the entrance scenes of fall impress the embassies on their clarity which also conveys emotions of the confusion and unforeseenness which arises, when somewhere suddenly the history changes.
Afflek similar effect and it the colleagues reach in the fictitious scenes (the false headquarters on Teheran bazaar).
The processes in too many places are too much.
The director had to have an affair with the fact that the narration doesn't suppose a set of the exciting scenes of the cinematographic value.
He enough successfully works with these few things, thinks - something through occasionally there all of it goes out not so elegantly (the scene in which telephone call in America prevents an approaching crisis in an airport of Teheran, and the chase on a runway look enough far-fetched).
Dispersion, connected with the necessity to show too many events in too many places, is the shortage "of Slang".
Alan Arkin and John Gudman in the Hollywood colleagues' role are indeed very charming, however their characters would deserve *greater* space, and they are in a film far not the sole.
Affleka film is in short supply a little *dramatic_effect* watch the film of which possible with moderate interest estimating production and retro-style re-creating it, the thrillers of the seventieth.
But capture with difficulty.
However it is sufficiently reminder about one, still in the known sense of living story, as well as for an evidence of that as exaggerated idea of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services.

The rules of inflation of the balloons, the bananas and a circus
A competition "in the most absurd decree or the project from a workshop of EU", about yearly conducting a polling most absurd bank collections, have now decided to announce the portal www.bankovnipoplatky com.
"Us spodviglo to it in which EU plans to receive the last event have declared 40-percent quote for the women in the administration of the large European companies" - "Right" organizer of questionnaire Patrick Nager.
There is a recent decision of the European court on a union with a stake of insurance payments for the men and the women among the absurdities, put forward nomination already.
Hitherto the women had benefits to insurance of life, because for the insurance companies they objectively are less subject to risk.
"The people can get farther incredible ideas from a workshop of EU from a competition before the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place before the end of February 2013" -, Nager has said.
To the questionable orders of EU relates, for example also obligatory addition of bio components into fuel, which, as a result, causes harm to nature, as well as a ban on use of the reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain, the relatively small number of dangerous substances, or the directive size are the cages for the hens, due to which in this year the eggs have considerably risen in price.
A factual ban on use of a term "sandwich oil" or a withdrawal from a sale of the classical bulbs has been subject also to the criticism.
The quality bananas must be the length of 14 centimetres.
The all-Europe apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of that or different the trading or industrial lobbies the positions of which in Brussels are usually protected with any state or a group of the states (Czechia now even under threat veta advocates the requirements of their banks with such an image).
Interests of the lobby are such:, for example the bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to have the length of 14 centimetres and didn't dare to reveal "abnormal curvature".
In this case the European Commission was justified with the fact that only harmonize the existing scattered national rules which complicated trade.
EU notwithstanding the resistance of some states has nevertheless softened standards, touching the fruits and the vegetables refering to the fact that existing directives will result in *squandering*/dissipation of products.
The candidate on gain in a polling can become also the last year's decree of the EU, agrees the air balls, to which selling themselves, necessarily must supply with a warning about the fact that the children are more junior than eight years they cannot be inflated without the adults' care.
EU has appealed to the American investigations in accordance with which the air balls in a game are a potential cause of the children's death by suffocation.
The similar restriction now spreads on the children before 14 years to which it is forbidden to blow into fair dudelki.
Amusing ideas are born also at home
Sufficiently absurd is and governed, touched the European officials: each who has any official job in EU, cannot taking delicacy of the theme for Greece into account use the name of Macedonia, but have to instead of it say "BYURM" (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) themselves.
The portal Bankovnipoplatky.com in cooperation with a union with the liberal economists has proposed "the Principle of non-intervention" (Laissez Faire) for a voting, the absurd rules, besides several higher stated, for example, the rule of EU about the volume of the food reserves in the territory of the membership state.
EU has set the maximum volume of the reserves of food which can be in the territory of the Czech Republic for a day of its entry to the European Union.
Czechia has hereafter exceeded, for example the set volumes of the canned mushrooms, for which her the heavy fine threatened.
The organizers of questionnaire has also attracted also the idea to pay to some countries for that, that they haven't a sea, is also the idea of allocation of the grants for a declaration of reception of the grants.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, and not in Brussels.
"We hold a disadvantageous position, because we haven't a sea.
We shall ask the European Union about compensation", - the then minister of agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CHSDP) declared 2004 years in autumn.
As argument, he has indicated that there was bountiful crop of a grain in the country, also as a result of the so named interventional purchases, the state had the full magazines of the reserves it was necessary to take which away.
For the fact that Czechia is far from the ports, EU, according to a Palas had to pay hundreds of millions of euros to us.
In a total the European commission has gone to meet the Czech Republic organizing tender of a purchase of a grain from the countries which haven't an exit to a sea.
The grants for reception of the grant has proposed to the villages the Ministry of regional development, led by minister Pavel Nemtsem (US-DEU) in particular such grants had to go from Brussels on compilation of a declaration on the grant.
EU: the Fancy orders are exception
Although the decrees in the states-members easily become an object of criticism, the effort of EU in adjustment, as well as more effectively functioning and the development of the European Union confessions in many experts' opinion deserve rather.
Scooping of the grants from EU for the projects which haven't even the hint at anything common to a recess of European integration, which the states-members have however attained in discussion of a budget in the experts' opinion is the serious problem.
Cause emotions among the Czechs and the fact that the Republic, as also in other countries of the European Union Czech, must struggle in Brussels for right of specific identification of its traditional products, and not always it wins in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of battles with the Germans and the Austrians have kept a name "the Olomoutskie cheese curds", however "Tuzemskij the rum" traditions of which in our country go away with roots in a century, 19, our producers are have to, was to rename on "Tuzemak".
Only the products from cane distillate, and not from the sugar beetroot can be called rum.
In an official list of registered products EU together with marzipan from German Lyubeka or the Parma ham, worldwide famous for the cheeses "of *Fet*" and "gorgondzola", is narrower, it has turned, out, for example, the Karlovy Vary rusks, pogorzhelitskij and trshebon'skij, the carp and zhatetskij are drunkenness.
By the also goods sign of EU spice cake and gorzhitskie the duct can be proud of pardubitskij.

The people want me to protect the republic, but I am an amateur -, Okamura asserts.
Mr senator, how to run for the president's office comes for the person to the head?
I don't think about the fact to become oneself a senator or the president.
If with us in a country everything functioned without the problems then I anywhere wouldn't run.
But I cannot see, as in the last 20 years the country is plundered as here the thieves, fuss, taxes and pensionable age increase for the people already.
I hadn't the ambitions to be a politician.
But I when I see somehow that don't please, me then try to find a solution as change it.
And since I have already accomplished forty years and I an independent person, not relating not to, am the parties to which at, there is no me for the other possibility to influence the things except as run for an office of a senator or the president.
You have got to a Senate but have shortly departed to a presidential lock.
Don't you turn from such an image by the back to the people who have chosen you?
I said all the time that I would join to struggle for a presidential lock of depending on result of the election to a Senate.
I have later precised that I if I am chosen by the senator then shall run for the presidents.
My aim isn't job, the job is the instrument with the help of which I can realize its glances.
The greatest influence and the widest authorities therefore are for me necessary.
But difficulty not only in the fact that we as a nation repine with us in a bar or at the TV set, but in this case is ready to trample any who will try to change something.
The mass media which denigrate the person, and which confound freedom of speech with freedom of lie add to it.
It was told that I gave the bribes to the journalists, or that I was adviser Irzhi Paroubeka me, for example about.
We shall pass to your glances.
For a presidential lock you have started with the theses on material and criminal responsibility of the politicians and the reverse property declarations to sum above twenty million struggle.
It is to realize it necessary to change a law.
You, as the president, haven't such authorities, and only the entire senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this task?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied the fact that the execution of excursions has become a free enterprise it has proved possible to advance it.
The problem consists in intrigue - when somebody comes with good offer on left or on right, obstacles, are deliberately raised for him, and it restrains the citizens.
As an independent nonpartisan person, I have the much *greater* potential for reception of a support from all parliamentary parties.
I without party-spreading out over the shelves, without looking back at doctrines can take my advantage that me what appears best for our country also to use that, it from each party.
Do you believe yourself the person, more relating to right or left?
It seems that the people class me sooner among left from a Czech viewpoint to me.
A little to the left or a little to the right are in general not important for me.
It is important for me that we walked ahead.
The matter concerns not about what somebody relates to right, and, somebody, to left, I want to combine the people.
I always shall support any decision whether will propose him KPCHM or GDP, good for a society, and I exactly as shall be against bad idea.
You are angry when somebody says that you are a populist.
But don't you prove it by the fact that you have said?
When you create business-plan for a company you also have some ideal aims and glances.
And you try to approach it.
It is possible to name it populism, but about which I say all offers, already functions in the world, or the eminent experts speak them.
But only the slogans will remain without your support of the parliament.
And with it you long won't hold out in a politician.
Or do you think that when you will go out to the people and will you speak them then you will succeed in realizing criminal and material responsibility?
I haven't the other possibility.
Only to convince the politicians, the journalists and a community and try to lure them away on their side, so that we attain own.
If I was elected to president then wouldn't make up a problem, to organize TV live broadcast, in which I shall appeal to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with appeal to legitimate material and criminal is responsibility for the politicians of the state the serving, judges and prosecutors.
And they in a case of a refusal will be have to report why it isn't wanted.
If the strong personality which will vocalize abuses is then it will be possible to exercise the pressure on a political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was merit of the pressure of the community.
I say directly that I am an amateur, and is not a genius and is not an intellectual.
I try to look for the allies to advocate my convictions and glances.
I only beginning am in a politician, and I for my programme shall try to find a support of majority.
I try to advance the affairs independently; I in that case if it doesn't prove, possible shall finish in six years and I shall return to a private sector.
It partly sounds so, like Okamura must salvage Czechia.
I am not no saviour.
I know that alone I shan't do anything, I have therefore bypassed a number of known people with offer to run to the Senate.
I have gone to Radimu Yanchure, he has refused in connection with the large volume of work.
Also I have at least supported journalist Yana Lorentsovu which has disclosed fraud with light fuel oil products conducting investigations.
I have put forward my candidacy because the people also really are non satisfied, but now I feel myself on the weights.
Sixty percent of people haven't gone on an election, and the majority of ones who have gone, the representatives of an establishment have been chosen.
We independent only two are in a Senate.
The people have chosen a Senate so that changes will come true with difficulty.
Notwithstanding it I shall struggle for my glances, for example for the direct election of the mayors and the governors.
Do you think about a base for an own party?
The about it me yet not thought, because at there is no me time of the fact to check the purity of past each potential partisan, and I am not at on it of money.
There is no money also on a presidential campaign, there are only twenty thousand crowns on my transparent bill.
Haven't you money?
Do you speak the property declarations, and how are your own affairs with it?
The personal property is estimated approximately at 60 million.
With me well also several more million in an account are, the area is in Prague of the cost of about 25 million, the apartment on 10 million, one more apartment on 8 million, collection of products of art approximately 10 million, Aston-Martin on 3,5 million and Skoda Superb on a million.
To the purpose Aston-Martin has appeared at me because it was my boyish dream - me always pleased Dzhejms Bond who rode a machine, was gallant with the women and in the same time struggled against meanness and lawlessness.
Do you do Aston-ride on Martin, do you possess a property on 60 million and at you, is there no money on a campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you specially don't want in it to invest own money.
It is not very persuasive.
I haven't 15 millions on a campaign.
Must I fall in debts?
I have inserted in a campaign already 2,5 million.
It is that fact that I haven't the sponsors, testifies to the fact that my programme is not so interesting.
And I must not pay for the election campaign from my pocket.
Senatorial salary will cover expenses for a campaign over of essence to me.
But on this money I wouldn't live, for example, couldn't pay to a son for the English school which costs 30 thousand monthly.
If I wanted only to make money so anywhere wouldn't run.
Then further will you deal with an enterprise, so that it is possible to live?
Didn't you really say that you would reduce this activity?
But it doesn't depend on the size of salary.
As I also promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
My deputy in spring will become, for example manager director of the tourist agency.
The people would want, which which I was bessrebrennikom, will store, the republic.
But it is for me too necessary on something to live.
How much have as a businessman you got accustomed to receive monthly?
What I also further from two hundred to four hundred thousand receive.
And if I have become a president, then would finish one's enterprise.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday production of a newspaper "Right".

The architects MVRDV prove that real adventures are not only in imagination - on example Spejkenisse and he of the recently built Book mountain - 2 photographs
"This building seems cheerful, it looks futuristichno, it finally with us again is possible to see something interesting -, Lizette Verkhajg speaks, the passer-by is on an edge of the road to me".
And Stephen Spermon, the specialist in IT on a situated nearby large enterprise, believes so: "No this building is indeed beautiful".
But do I ask myself: what we need one more library today for?
Everybody has the Internet, the iPad and the electronic books.
Does already nobody now voluntarily go to such oldfashioned libraries probably?
An unusual record belongs to the sleeping small town near Rotterdam, Spejkenisse-small notable.
The population quantity his 80.000 people have the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
For struggle with this vexatious circumstance it several years ago was decided to make a contribution to common formation and build seven fictitious bridges which are depicted on the banknotes of the euro, as the pictorially coloured miniatures from ferroconcrete.
The success in this enlightening initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city understood that in them had remained the sole possibility to overcome statistics: build a library here!
Accuse Maas from the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, the expert on the brave *STOLBCHATYJ* diagrams and the author of even the witty, occasionally cynical constructions, have treated a task with their common imperturbation and have appeared on competitively listening in the year 2003 with five books under a mouse and grin on the face.
And as long as the members of a jury puzzledly looked around and *SHRUG1* of the shoulders, impudent Maas has made up a pyramid in size for their original gift and has completed speech in defense of their project the next words: "about the Respectful townspeople"!
It, my offer: here are "the Book mountain" is in Spejkenisse so named Bukenberg!
After nine years this mountain of the cost of 30 million of a euro has grown.
She is the part of the project revitalizatsii which includes also an underground garage, the supermarket, the dwelling houses and taunkhausov altogether on 50 apartments adjoining them will esteem also several.
At the beginning of November "the Book mountain" was noted the second prize of the competition "the Best library of the Netherlands of 2012".
Also the project provides a national Dutch competition in the wooden buildings 2012.
In such a way the faceless suburb which before couldn't propose anything except a postmodernistic pedestrian zone and the surprisingly ugly town hall of which the white facades are led to the idea of a dairy has become richer in one modern work of architecture.
But most important - into Spejkenisse has appeared a public building of cultural destination is the first in the history of this small town.
A long road to a book
The first impression: book *EL'DORADO* is under a hood for cheese.
Only one lift, going at the center of mountain range, for the real admirers of architecture and reading will prefer to investigate this locality on foot, is here.
The glazed from all sides the room is light and easily is comprehensible floors from a burned brick also the elegant street lanterns unerringly create a feeling of the public urban area.
The urban medium is re-created ideally.
Involuntarily look for glance the benches, the boys and the girls, also playing the dogs in football.
And the books, the books, the books are everywhere.
"The usually book regiments stand along the facades, and in middle is a large dark hall as a rule, comfortless and faceless", - speaks Accuse Maas.
We have placed classical configuration of space from the legs on the head and have extracted a zone for reading from within outside.
Internal space of the book mountain is used skilfully: the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the ecological center and the technical rooms are at the center.
The black book regiments which serve as a sometimes decoration of the walls, and sometimes the parapets, and sometimes the staircase railings especially please.
Their kind, texture and smell are unusual.
Even the sophisticated architects and engineers-builders get lost in guesses what unknown material it is.
"We strove work with the secondary materials" -, Jop Trauborst explains, the leader of the project, presenting a community of Spejkenisse in accordance with the requirements of standard.
And somehow since we have met suitable collateral product of agriculture on one agrarian enterprise into Frislandii.
The years in the greenhouses, and to the fields in the Netherlands, as a lining, under roots applies the artificial fibrous material of millimetre thickness are already much.
Cheaply also it economizes the time.
Thin textile serves a one-two season, after it to throw him out is possible.
For a library this linen - for the first time in such volumes - was compacted in a panel of thickness four centimetres.
Under effect of fever and pressure so named landbauplastik (KLP) converts into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, there is a a little reminding new automobile and a little are the gym-shoes over the smell.
105 steps lead to apex.
A one who will overcome way of the length of almost 500 metres, will be rewarded in a literary cafe with not only a fantastic view on the city, but also Dutch croquets and the woody ficuses in the pots.
They take care about an atmosphere, also primarily correct the humidity of air on a literary mountain.
Expenditure for the new soul
"It is difficult to come to believe, but this building, notwithstanding a set of the glass surfaces, is the exemplary project the plan of ecology" -, Trouborst speaks.
Heat of ground is used for its heating and refrigeration.
Although the Book mountain stands under the glass hood even in clear days the sun gets inside only *FOR1* a short time.
The wide farms from glued wood, situated perpendicularly to the glass facade, give shadow and admit the large part of the solar rays on themselves.
Climate in a room is very pleasant.
The automatic roll curtains insure remaining protection completely.
Stephen Spermon, the mentioned higher skeptic from a sphere of IT has already visited a new library.
Lizette Verkhajg has also already been here.
As well as a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine *Cynthis* Bogard who has named Bukenberg "the Spejkenisse soul enough which there wasn't for a long time".
A cause: in several weeks before a discovery each inhabitant received invitation to bestow one book from an own meeting.
These books had to occupy the empty places on the shelves of the library - not completely staffed 70.000 books were for that moment in it yet.
The idea has worked.
The regiments are made completely.
"Nothing worse than a half empty library - has been" an architect speaks if Maas had Accused.
"I think that due to our invitation now each inhabitant in some way is connected with this new house.
Each knows that its book is the part of this building.
Even if she serves only for a decoration.
It thus, MVRDV has proved possible to solve the royal task which on professional slang is called creation of an identity.
Spejkenisse has written the literary history.
And although they are very young and are uneducated.
It is however only the origin for a construction of an identity.

A sabot: "the Germans must play a more important role"
Germany has abstained in a voting about confession of Palestine.
In opinion of Stephen Sabo, the expert on the connections between the USA and Europe acting so Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany at first allowed understand that she will vote against an application of the Palestinians of reception of a status of an observer at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in a voting.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany doesn't support action of the Israelis in Gaza.
It is now for Germany necessary to be cautious in connection with its special relations with Israel.
But simultaneously I believe that it also doesn't support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - at it not appearing too critically Israel.
During uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany has also abstained in a voting about introduction of a forbidden zone for the flights.
In the total of NATO have conducted this offer.
Does Germany find it difficult to hold a distinct position in the complicated international questions?
Yes, it is so.
The matter is that it is in a process of conversion of its foreign policy, namely passes from policy of which so to say the USA were controlled to properly German foreign policy.
The situation is additionally complicated with the fact that coordinated integral policy is absent at the Europeans.
Thus the Germans again turn out between two fronts.
It is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they to it haven't got accustomed from them.
I believe that as long as they only fumble with my role, but is on a way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy which France or Great Britain conduct.
What does the "normal" foreign policy from a German viewpoint specifically mean?
It is readiness to hold a position, not depending on a position of the USA or the European partners, in its national interests.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy i.e. from export and the connections with the definite regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Economic interests of Germany to a significant extent differ from interests of other large states, and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Have influenced these economic interests on a position in the Middle East conflict and on a voting in the UN?
First Germany has the large markets of a sale in the Middle East in particular in the states of the Persian gulf.
It therefore is for her necessary to show caution not to insult a community and the elites in the Arab countries.
In any case it plays its role.
But I wouldn't attach too great importance to it, it is not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case it plays an important role in calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed to its relations with the USA abstaining in making of the important decisions, such as a voting about Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even to the USA prevails understanding of a German position.
Therefore I don't think that it was the same dramatic fracture as in a Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even acquire respect, by such an image defined.
However it signals the fact that it is necessary to perceive her earnestly as a player on international arena and that behoves to reckon with its interests.
Different opinions about a Palestinian initiative exist in Europe.
The USA have conversely distinctly spoken out for veto.
Is there disagreement between opinions between the USA and many European states?
Owing to American inner policy such differences existed always.
I believe that the government of Obama in the depth of the soul has sufficient understanding of a European position.
But in connection with a local political situation the government, of course, cannot openly hold such a position.
I believe that essential disagreements in opinions are quite not so significant, as always seems.
You if you consider relations between Obama and prime minister Netanyahu then will notice that Obama is quite not in admiration for Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it easy to combine its close connections with Israel and the USA on the one hand and a position of the most important partner in EU from other?
I think just it makes a situation of such difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would find it somewhat simpler if integral, non-contradictory European policy, existed, but now it is not so.
Therefore they cannot appear within the framework of wider approach and is forced instead of it act leaning against only the own vision of a situation.
Just so they treat a euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in the production of a common European position on *MYSELF*.
It is understandable that for Germany it is not simple at least because of the connections with Israel.
This theme always was ticklish.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself in a role of an important international player - won't she take the indeed main role on herself?
Or is else heavily still the leading role given to Germany?
Germany hasn't got accustomed to it yet, to play a significant role hitherto and, for the obvious causes, hitherto always heavily yields is always disagreeable for her.
We shall view, for example, when the crisis of the euro is each time Germany takes an important role on ourselves, most different anti German emotions are manifested.
The Germans must not just cope with it.
Properly speaking, it is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded with the hostile countries.
From this viewpoint Germany holds a significantly heavier position than the USA.
She must take into account of the most different neighbours and opinion, and it is not simple.
Does influence of the USA in European policy thus permanently weaken, but at a given moment of EU don't fill in this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans just will have to play a more significant role.
Even if it doesn't please you, it is disagreeable or reinforces your - dislike the life is such!

"The protection of the goods signs" is in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly will become Chinese
Armani - worldwide known trademark Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But what is Armani Polo such?
This name which hasn't anything common to the companies from the names of which it is formed, perfectly officially registered in China.
It will be nevertheless guarded, until the owners of the initial names file for a suit.
But it is then unclear whether it will prove possible with him to advocate the rights.
"The foreigners find it still more difficult to protect their goods signs in China" - the, Thomas Pattlokh speaks, lawyer of a company of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violations of rights of the goods signs in the Far East.
On my table by each week appear in a new affair of such a kind.
For the imitators sufficiently to add in all a couple of letters to acquire right to register one's trading signs.
So from Gucci turns out Lu-Gucci, it instead of Prada is possible to register Prada-Kny.
The German enterprises, for example, the producer of sports goods of Puma are legally copied by the same mode.
Pattlokh opens a folder with the recordings of the department of a registration of the goods signs in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010 the Chinese company registered trading sign Zegna DF Puma, the artificial name for which also the name of the fashionable house of Ermenegildo Zegna is used there.
The fact that the Chinese are the champions of the world in copying and violation of rights of an intellectual property, known.
There in the large cities are multistorey department stores, selling almost only the counterfeits.
Which the opposes fact that the Chinese enterprises perfectly officially acquired a he however is Pattlokha affairs not such On assignment of his principals right to use name is narrower is guarded somewhere else from the department of a registration of the goods signs.
The Chinese name it "ban a share, the mark-passenger are the ministry".
This word associates itself "with ban dakuan'".
The women who hunt for the rich men are so named.
The Chinese authorities don't recognize guilt behind them
"It causes damage to business, to struggle, - with it is necessary", Pattlokh is convinced.
"The trademark diffuses, the unique position gets lost, the image very strongly suffers".
Financial losses and judicial expenses in branches that have suffered are calculated with millions especially in a case of expensive copied products.
According to data of the company of investigations to market CLSA China with the volume of the sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third in size and most quickly growing market of a sale of the items of luxury.
To attain removal of the doubtful recordings in register of the trading signs is however difficult, and it costs dearly.
The process can last up to nine years, with unclear outcome.
Pattlokh tells about the affairs, into which the court rejected the suits, for upon expiration of the long time the contested name has become "reality of market".
If the plaintiff hasn't luck then he will even have to pay to a plagiarist, for have caused damage to its trading sign in China, Pattlokh speaks.
Occasionally here the law of the jungles corrects.
There are also famous cases of the graphic elements.
In 2009 the company of Daimler lost judicial argument with a producer of construction machines Sany, the enterprise which has shortly before that acquired a company-producer of concrete-pumps Putzmeister.
Therefore the Chinese hitherto have right to use emblem, similar to a star of Mercedes.
The company of Geely that has bought Volvo initially used a blue-white logotype, a process is BMW; that was reminding, Geely was successful, one has had to change him.
The producer of fashionable goods of Lacoste has lost in China to the imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore at which the famous crocodile saw the other side.
The Chinese authorities don't believe themselves guilty.
The department of a registration of the goods signs CTMO in Beijing confirms that in the year 2010 because of a shortage of the personnel and the equipment of the rooms there had a place of difficulty.
But in the last year "the return from emergency in a working process to norm" happened.
So the number of crude affairs over objections has diminished by 22 percent.
Almost 57.000 such affairs were closed 75 percent more than in the last year.
Productions in a department nevertheless still else expect 81.500 complaints.
It dearly is worth struggling with it
As very frequent in China figures impress.
In the last year in CTMO more than 1,4 million declarations of the protection of the trading signs entered almost the third more than into 2010.
It also means, which China for the tenth time in succession has headed, the record, a department reports the list of the new registrations in the whole world.
The same concerns the common number of actual trading signs, in all 5,5 million pieces.
In 2011 1,8 billion yuans of collections were paid off.
If simplify it means that each registration stands on the average in 1280 yuans or 160 euros.
It is worth contesting many times more her as an affair of the German family enterprise of Freudenberg shows.
Over a distance of more than seven years the concern struggles against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans have succeeded in attaining the fact that the illegal production by him of the false automobile details was liquidated.
The imitator has however allotted Chinese rights of trading sign Freudenberg for himself.
It was an own omission, for the last names in Germany must not is *PROTECTION*, Khanno Venttsler speaks, the head of the board of administration Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the department of a registration of the trading signs CTMO has rejected a complaint myunkhentsev.
True in the both next instances Freudenberg has won, but the opposite side continues struggle hitherto.
It is necessary to it be on the alert
Now the question is on consideration in the Supreme court.
Venttsler hopes to bring up an affair to good termination and praises professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the Process is exceedingly expensive and takes away much time, money and the nerves from us".
Internal expenditures hardly yield to a registration, the archive of the company, one has had to view even the acts of a centennial prescription to give the proofs.
Five years ago Freudenberg without results proposed "large six digit sum of a euro" for settlement to an opposite side.
"It hence is clear how dearly it costs - us", Venttsler speaks.
Dangers of the Far East threaten to bandy even to Europe.
Namely the in that case if imitators will register the unprotected trading signs there behind them.
So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name of Freudenberg for the footwear and products of the skin.
The concern has long ago stopped production in these regions, but notwithstanding it could prevent a registration.
"It is necessary to it be on - the alert", Venttsler speaks.
Both he, and lawyer Pattlokh recommend to the German enterprises to be very cautious of China.
It is insufficient to rely upon the international theses on the protection of the goods signs rather the foreigners, it follows, Venttsler speaks, "that in any way it is worth protecting everything, register also in China" -.
Otherwise it can manage much dearer than a registration.
It is actual: if Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of a trading sign, then to pay license collections to an opposite side for an own name, will be have to, Venttsler explains.
We shall be otherwise forced out from a market in a questionable segment.

World day of AIDS: pritoptyvat' to sing help
Into Khajdel'berge the chorus of Imbongi - and the in Swaziland orphans of AIDS is glad about it rehearse.
The history of relations that have overcome the distance more than 8733 kilometres.
At first sounds heeling: the cowboy high boots, the basketball gym-shoes, the lady boats and the male slippers pick up the time on the parquet floor and quickly find him.
The time-two-three-four.
Only after it the voices of the singers - the viola, the bass, the tenor and a soprano - they advance, charm and follow each other slowly grow.
Khopf, and *phita* a 29 year-old conductor, almost bounce out of one's cloth shoes, when lead them with flexible and expressive gestures.
An evening of Monday, the in a musical hall institute of medical, psychology in Khajdel'berge the chorus of Imbongi rehearses new song.
Fifty participants of a chorus from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in genetics of a person to a janitor have come on rehearsal.
"Ohm" Obani" - not simple thing, each voice of the chorus has its text besides, in the perfectly alien language: which the, *Zulu*, eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique speak and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help is for self-help
According to the grade of Unaids of the programme of the United Nations of struggle with AIDS about 34 million HIV-infected in the world exist.
23,5 million from them live in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland 000 orphans of AIDS live in 245.
In this case more than 40 percent of the population by HIV-are positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village Esitzheni union Voices for Africa has found the chiefs in Germany.
70 of them visit a school, preparing for a farther instruction.
For 15 or 20 euros per month it is possible to take patronage on oneself.
It guarantees money on the center to a child the school, Gogh's-school uniform and, daily hot lunch in.
Imbongi in a *Zulu* language means a narrator or voskhvalitel'.
In this hall isn't told fluently, on for the bow on the other hand is *CAN1* to sing.
The chorus learns almost ten years songs in this alien soft language and from time to time even brings them again there where they for the first time have appeared: to the south of Africa.
The village Esitzheni which depends on the voices of the German chorus is however at the distance of 8733 kilometres of summer from Khajdel'berga, in the north-west of the kingdom Swaziland.
Forty percent are infected
There about 2000 people some hitherto in the simple huts from clay and a straw, there are many children among the inhabitants are lived.
More than 300 of them have remained without the parents who have died from a virus ICH.
Into Esitzheni in a miniature is reflected the disease of the whole Swaziland: the highest level of HIV-infection, the expected duration of life according to data of UNICEF, lowest in the world.
Cutting of the extreme flesh have the men which dokazanno decreases risk of infection half, among the population, it isn't almost accepted.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry a virus of immunodeficiency in oneself, the death is on the middle of the fourth ten - not the rarity.
The chorus has opened this village in a joint journey Africa in spring of 2005, but before, participants Imbogni have seen a set of the children in the streets for which there weren't enough not only parental care, but just everything: food, the clothes of education.
No chances without school formation with a person are in a poor country in general.
At first it was private obligation of the individual participants - for several euros per year send a child to a school and grant a possibility of times per day to it to receive hot food.
But after already a year the chorus has based the union "Voices for Africa" which since then almost professionally takes care about the orphans of AIDS into Esitzheni.
The facts of about infections conveyed by the sexual way
What are the most important diseases, conveyed by the sexual way?
Syphilis, khlamidioz and a gonorrhoea (the gonorrhoea) is classed among bacterial IPPP.
Viral IPPP are frequent, HIV, the human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The pubic pediculosis and the scabies relate to parasitic IPPP.
What are the basic struck groups?
The syphilis and the gonorrhoea occur in the main thing at the men which make love for the men.
The institute of Robert Koch proceeds from the fact that the minimum of four of each five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, the transfer happens as a result of sexual contacts between the men.
khlamidijnye of infection, trikhomoniaz, kandidoz (the fungus) the gonorrhoea and the human papilloma-virus are the ones that at the heterosexual adult people often occur with the diseases, conveyed by the sexual way.
The dissemination of HIV among the heterosexual adults with us is comparatively low - however about 20 percent of new infections of HIV fall on this group.
One occurs among the youth khlamidijnye infection considerably more often than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections strike the young people from 15 to 25 years.
The human papilloma-virus with us often occurs also among the youth.
How does the number of infection cases change?
Not all diseases, conveyed by the sexual way, must the obligatory is *REGISTRATION*.
The sickness rate of syphilis according to data of the Institute of Robert Koch more than has doubled from 1697 cases in the year 2001 before 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new infections of HIV since 2007 goes down.
About 2700 cases were in 2011.
It is the about one tenth less than in a previous year.
What symptoms point a venereal disease?
Ulcers in the region of the genitals, the complaint in urination, allocation, pain below the belly, as well as the bubbles or the seals can arise in the infectious diseases.
They aren't often however accompanied by pains and other symptoms and remain unobserved.
How is it possible to defend oneself?
The condoms are capable of reducing risk of infection, but don't give hundred-percent protection.
However partially the exciters of the diseases, conveyed by the sexual way, can be spread also by contact infection and at close physical contact.
Therefore the experts recommend a regular checkup especially in frequent replacement of the sexual partners.
In early diagnostic it is possible to cure the majority IPPP and avoid remote consequences.
The patronage, donations and the not into last queue the fees for performances of the chorus over the whole Germany allow assembling of something.
"In all we have sent into Esitzheni already near 200 to 000 euros", Annete Lennartts speaks, the chairman of a union.
Tsodva conscious Dlamini, and an active woman in the village itself manages money from Germany.
She takes care also the about fact that the orphans will be well made, for example at one of the grandmothers.
Gogos how names the old women on *Zulu*, it is a support of a village.
Some of them have admitted up to 14 orphans to oneself, give a roof over the head to them and take care about the fact that the children in a form each day in time appear on the lessons.
Ones in whom the relatives haven't remained enter the shelter to Khanijsile who earning salary from a unification as also two cooks prepare for the lonely woman each day for more than 200 hungry children.
Besides that union "Voices for Africa" has organized the sewing school, has built two hencoops and has jointly with an American organization for the protection of the health PSI organized surrender of analysis on HIV for many inhabitants of a village.
It is difficult to present, but about the disease which is so obvious in the whole country, prefers deeply to be silent.

Annete Lennartts - says "because he is connected with sexuality" "AIDS is absolute taboo" -.
In which enough unusually a country the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Msvati are III famous for their love for excesses.
The polygamy is instead of democracy.
Guilt of the fact that the virus ICH so quickly spread in the last years also falls on such a style, authorized by the state, of life in particular.
But she lies also on the roving workers who deliver a virus to a country.
The free condoms are literally at each corner, Annete Lennartts speaks, "but almost don't use them.
The other culture is flesh to flesh".
To a little support cultural exchange chorus Ibmogni of each two-three years makes a journey the south of Africa and sings songs, full of melancholy, the battle spirit, the certainty and black apperception which are many on the southern edge of the black continent know since times of apartheid yet.
The bus, full of white which sing songs is in a black language - such a recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, it happened, called of a tear on the eyes of the stern border guards.
The journey always leads also into Esitzheni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Notwithstanding the fact that it is possible to find the small village with difficulty on a kart in a valley of the river Etsulveni she is more than known.
"Walk into Esitzheni, light - is there", the local people speak.
And after the 8733-kilometre flight back into Khajdel'berg, it when the stamping singers return to the rehearsal hall in street Bergkhajmer, is possible to see that this light burns also here.

Messendzher: NASA opens ice on Mercury
Probe "Messendzher" has found the proofs of the fact that on a planet Mercury is ice.
The glacial cover can have thickness up to 20 metres.
The space department of the USA has proved the presence of ice on planet Mercury to NASA.
There although she is situated closest of all to the sun there also is water that has frozen as emerges from three investigations, published on Thursday in Science special magazine.
Probe "Messendzher" has found the proofs of the fact that the region of the planet, permanently being in shadow, is covered with ice.
Its thickness must equal the minimum of 30 centimetres, and, perhaps, even before 20 metres.
Presumptively water originates from comet or, a, perhaps, asteroid that has collided with Mercury.
Nobody connects opening of ice with existence of life on a planet, the scientific leader of a probe Sean Solomon has said.
The temperature on Mercury can be the 426 degrees of Celsius.
However these discoveries would be able to help to explain how water and other construction elements of life have got to other places of the Solar system.
Imperceptibly for the inhabitants of the earth the probes, the telescopes and the small robots, for example, "the Phoenix" investigate the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send on the earth the images: the small windows into infinite distances.
The image enters from the chamber which the German researchers from the Institute of Max Planck have developed.
Eight planets of our Solar system, as well as the dwarfish planet are *Ceres*.
As also Pluto which revolves about the sun behind Neptune *Ceres* by new definition of an international astronomical union from 2006, isn't "a planet".
This fragment of the infrared photograph of telescope "Spittser" represents "the family portrait" of the countless generations of the stars: the oldest stars as the blue points, as it is more difficult to identify the pink "newborn" stars in star circle.
This region of *ZVEZDOOBRAZOVANIE* - the scientists non romantic names his W5 - opened with a telescope "of Spittser" in constellation *Cassiopeia*, at the distance of 6500 light years.
A telescope of NASA "Spittser" has photographed this opalescent fever of the dying star.
The ring, similar to a doughnut, consists of the material the star has thrown which out in a process of *dying*.
The new stars arise from gas and dust in Trifid gigantic haziness, separated from the earth by 5400 light years.
The telescope of NASA "Spittser" has made this photograph of the galactic childbirth hall.
Star accumulation of Pleiad also named, to see "Seven sisters", in the night by the naked eye is possible.
Of course, with a telescope colours turn out better.
As the red eye winkes at an observer haziness Snail on this infrared photograph.
She is situated at distance of 700 light years in constellation of the Spouter.
The similarity to the earth continent has brought this haziness nickname "the North America".
The combination provides normal and infrared photography with expressive colour rendition.
It has proved possible to photograph this new star in the whole beauty only with the help of the infrared sensors of telescope "Spittser".
Saturn and his rings: How they have arisen - one of the great riddles *BE* astronomies.
Perhaps it is the splinters of the moon of Saturn which tracelessly disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most distinct photographs of telescope "Hubble": Galaxy Eddy
Depending on colour rendition the photographs of helical Galaxies convert to the present works of art.
The photograph, published by the European Southern observatory, shows haziness, removed on several thousand light years, of Trifid in constellation of Sagittarius.
Trifid name has originated from a Latin word trifidus (triple, three separate), for the dark bands of dust are divided into three if the incandesced heart of the cradle of the stars had done rapidly.
In constellation of *ZMEENOSETs* the astronomers have photographed presage of space collision: at the distance of 400 million light years the nuclei two Galaxies, from the earth poured out, rush to meet each other and unavoidably will collide.
Telescope "Hubble" has removed this birth of the star in helical Galaxy M83.
The one whom not technical reductions please can name her by nickname "the Southern *TSEVOCHNYJ* Wheel".
The photograph of space telescope "Hubble" shows a fragment of haziness of Iris in constellation of Tsefeya.
Haziness, separated from from ten to one hundred times by 1400 light years, consists of the particles of dust of which the sizes are smaller than that of common domestic dust.
This image was made up for the optical and X-ray photographs of the different telescopes.
It shows a ring from the black holes, separated from the earth by 430 million light years.
Space telescope "Hubble" 273 has photographed this group of Galaxies by Arp name for NASA.
UGC name the scientists 1810 large helical Galaxy.
The brightest group of the new stars of our Milky way is in this star haziness.
The star cradle permanently creates the new stars.
This star cloud, bound to haziness Socket, also permanently creates the new stars - at the distance of 5000 light years from the earth.
There else is no dust only gas in this brightly shining Galaxy with a small black hole.
The researchers suppose that she has arisen shortly before the Big bang, when in the main thing there was hydrogen in the universe.
Our glances to the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem - else before Galileo Galileo has year later started observation of the stars.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became still more - and accessible to their glance spaces are still deeper.
During "*KHALA*" in an observatory of Fallen *MARA* is 30 years namely from 1947 to 1975 old the telescope near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had diameter five metres.
In Arizona, the USA "the Large binocular telescope" is set.
He allows seeing of space with the help of two mirrors, each by diameter 8,4 metres.
"Grain Teleskopio Kanarias" has a gigantic internal device - the diameter of alone of only the mirror reaches 10,4 metres.
The mirror "of the Large south African telescope" in the South Africa is segmented - for the sake of decrease in cost.
Nevertheless in diameter it reaches about eleven metres.
A shortage of inexpensive constructive execution: the telescope rigidly is fastened at a vertical angle - it restricts its mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-Eberli" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light-assembling ability.
She reaches - the parameters of the largest world telescopes notwithstanding the comparatively small diameter of the mirror -.
With the help of the radio telescope into Aresibo (Puerto Rico) the researchers listen to the extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has diameter 305 metres.
Participating in the project "Search for an extraterrestrial mind" (SETI) any owner of a computer can help granting his computational power.
A view on an observatory of the European astronomical service (ESO) in Chilean Andes.
Here stands "a Very large telescope" - completely corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow illuminating of even the average infrared spectrum in a visual pipe.
In the Chilean observatory ESO the installation "of a European Very large telescope" is also planned.
Its main mirror must spread out on the entire 42 metres - will be also made up for almost 1000 mirror elements.
It however is necessary not to expect the photographs earlier than 2018.
Before 2007 both telescopes "Kek" on Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were believed largest in the world.
Two mirrors of diameter ten metres are installed into them.
Telescopes "Kek" are included into composition of the observatory Mauna-Kea which together with them sees also the sky with the help of telescopes "Subaru" and IRTTF.
Besides that the new gigantic telescope - with a mirror of diameter thirty metres on Mauna-Kea must appear.
It here for them is possible to admire illustrations.
Space telescope "Hubble" however delivers space the most important kinds.
Since 24 April 1990 he delivers the pictures of the far worlds.
From March 2009 space telescope "Kepler" looks for the planets beyond the limits of the Solar system - primarily such on which the life is possible.
On 2 February of the year 2011 of NASA reported, that 1235 planets-candidates were is detected from the beginning of the mission.
In the photographs the last preparations of space telescope "Kepler" are imprinted.
The space telescope of James Uebba (JWST) won't be sent to space earlier than the year 2018 on a board of the rocket "of Arian 5".
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has diameter 6,5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he must from the world of the first stars and Galaxies look for the Big bang.
The scientists suppose that there on the southern pole of Mercury is ice.
There are however no certain data on it for "Messendzher" revolves closer to the northern pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over a distance of the decades pointed the fact that there on Mercury is ice.
Due to a year, thrown into 2004, probe "Messendzher" - first which revolves about Mercury - the scientists now are sure in it.

Drink oil each day - also live before 168 years
In the southern Azerbaijan many inhabitants are till-at biblically old age.
A museum of longevity even exists here.
Search for a solution in a country where the 97 year-old old people seem some more comparatively young.
In the southern Azerbaijan many inhabitants are till-at biblically old age.
A museum of longevity even exists here.
Search for a solution in a country where the 97 year-old old people seem some more comparatively young.
It is possible to name the journey across the *TALYSHSKIJ* mountains wild and romantic.
The minibus with clatter rolls over a winding road by the hills, the stormy small rivers and the simple peasant houses that have overgrown the thick forests.
Everything round is so green and it is bright that it is possible to think you like are in *Sshwarzwald*.
But it is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only in several kilometres hence.
*TALYSh* - one of the peoples of the Caucasus of which known a little only really the fact that they beautifully speak farsi and azerbajzhdanskom and differ in longevity is live here.
Lerik is the destination point.
The small small town boasts about the too heavy architecture of Soviet times which doesn't match the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
The tourists almost don't come from Europe here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku is too tedious.
Eight hours go away for the road has in all one band on 323 kilometres.
The legendary wealth which owes a country petroleum of the Caspian sea, here, to a province so far hasn't got.
However convinced that in Lerike eat Pilate Fatulaeva (48) by what attract the tourists.
"In May Baku became famous for festival of song Eurovision - and festival of the oldest people of the world - at us will take place in the next year", Fatulaeva speaks.
She is a director of a museum of longevity, probably sole in the world.
Here the biography of about eight dozens of *TALYSh* from these places which more than are 100 years of Fatulaeva old point black-and-white photography is documented.
It is my grandfather, he is here 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years one more child to it was born
But shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov, who has allegedly accomplished 168 years is the questionable star of the museum.
There is no evidence of birth however.
And considering the fact that whose age is confirmed the documents, have accomplished 122 years for the oldest person, Myuslyumova age seems exceedingly doubtful.
"He was born in this district in 1805, died in 1973" -, Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 years the daughter to it allegedly was born.
Has so shepherd Myuslyumov added a couple of tens of years to his age?
However even Rembrandt Shol'ts, the researcher of age from the Institute of Max Planck in Rostock heard of the long-lived persons in the Central Asia.
"Many people, "exceedingly many very old people of age, Shol'ts says to declining meet also in some districts of China, in Japan or in a valley of Khunza in Pakistan, - is possible, live on Sardinia also" are striking".
Scientific confirmation of age is however because of the absence of the documents impossible, since registers of the civil state weren't.
A glass of melted oil is each day
There nevertheless is fact that the people in Lerika district strikingly often are at biblical age.
20 people older than 100 years now live here.
Why here, in the south, are the long-lived persons so much?
Azerbaijani excursion guide Farid Mugimzade explains it with the special genes of *TALYSh*.
The director of museum Fatulaeva conversely believes that he is an affair in supply.
*TALYSh* like meat, bread and everything is more, a glass of melted oil drinks each day milk products, many of them However, hardly such a high calorie diet can be a healthy from dietologic viewpoint.
Or is the affair in the primeval lifestyle which keeps the people the youth V Chengemirane, the tiny settlement not far from the city of Lerik, does Rubaba Mirzoyev live.?
Into 97 years she is else comparatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva which assert that at her 143 descendants, live in a simple wooden house, typical of only the Caucasian region.
She sits on a floor with the barrel of oil which tirelessly roll hither and thither.
Here under one roof live 8 people including, at which one of the sons and daughter Mirzaevoj, long ago are their grandchildren already.
Also nearby two babies gallop.
In a kitchen tea is made for the guests, which gives in the typical big-bellied glasses armudu.
Ideally, the even and strong white teeth, are under the head kerchief she hides the long dark chestnut tresses which her son with pride discloses in front of us at Mirzaevoj.
I always wash the hair with milk, so that they have never fallen out and have kept colour.
"And I have never used a shampoo" -, Mirzaeva speaks.
The monthly pension isn't in short supply for life
She always ate only the fact that have grown in an own yard, the tomatoes, potato, the pea.
In the whole life I never bought products in a shop.
Then she tells about her husband who served in an army.
Was after the Second world war the heaviest of all.
But have become better, when "favourite father" Geydar Aliyev rose at a wheel.
The propaganda not often sounds in the old woman's speech.
However cult, created around a figure of the father of a nation who governed a country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan practically doesn't know the boundaries.
He had the power before 2003, then, his son Ilham has received the reins of the government.
There nevertheless is no poverty among the Azerbaijani old people.
Mirzaeva receives 230 manats (about equal to the same sum of the euro) monthly as pension, for the local conditions it is the sum on which it is possible well to live.
And, son Mirzaevoj that has, perhaps, long ago grown is too right: "the old People in our culture enjoy deep respect".
They live in a big family, are favourite, is had in care and is happy.
By what not the reason to remain in alive is as long as possible

The word "human right" is absent in the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo testify to deep split in a country.
The future constitution, based on Shariat, has suffered furious rebuff.
The Egyptian president didn't begrudge pathos.
We must create a transition.
"The success also in him lies on my responsibility to a people and in front of God" -, he has said on state television.
His speech was turned to the whole people, but primarily to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the educated Muslims and the non religious Egyptians.
However they all, hitherto hopelessly dissociated, are in lost opposition, fear is felt.
Fear of the religious state on Nile on mercy "of powerful Brothers-Muslims".
Mohammed Mursi hardly whether not excusing has said that he temporarily cut down competence of the constitutional court and has expanded his competence "to salvage a revolution".
However the 61 year-old engineer, having the degree of a doctor of the American university of the Southern California, what in fact wants to salvage is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judicial power be deprived of force?
Night 15-hour download through in fact 234 articles succeeded in pulling in a constitutional meeting from 100 participants, and it partially causes fears with obstacles on to islamistski tuned.
As also in the previous constitutions, in the project it is told that the legal procedure leans "against the principles of Islamic right".
But what means "the principles"?
It was both more strict interpretation of Shariat remains interpretations and the, it is possible to fear that, Islamists will use the affair a nebulous statement and legal play for, arising in connection with it.
At least at it hints, one innovative article: it is necessary to attract the university to advice there is Al-Ashar in all the affairs touching Shariat an islamistic institution is the most important is the countries the one that has the high authority in the whole Sunni Islam.
It is not have to, but a restriction on the judicial power can mean that the clergy oversees legislation that de facto would have by investigation.
In the project of the constitution is an item of interpretation much
One more problem: suability of the civil faces to a military court must remain.
These courts in a period of the power of Mubarak served for suppression of the oppositionists.
Up to 11.000 civil faces after overthrow of a dictator were in military confinement.
Also, as said the project is in the state must guard "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "support its moral and the values".
Juridically it is formulated so indistinctly that the state institutions with the help of this article will be able to monitor even the keeping of a movie and literature.
By the open text it means none other than the censorship.
In general not an article single, sets equality of the men and the women straight.
But other forbids to insult and defame prophet Muhammed and his envoys.
But that such an insult also as it must be punished, remains unclear.
Doubtful also seems a statement, which is forbidden, "insult of the people".
Will sufficiently caricature of the president or joke about a legist be?
The question of interpretation as also much in this project which Mursi proposes on signature and which, according to his words, it "is very quick" will be presented to the Egyptians on referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
Opposition against the Islamists' superiority is formed already several weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity of the evening of Friday on the area of Takhrir in Cairo and have sworn to destroy this document else before it will be able to enter force.
"The revolution has returned, and we shall defeat" -, Khamdin Sabbakhi has said, having occupied the third place in the presidential election.
The laureate of the Nobel prize of peace and the former the head of the international department in atomic energy Mohammed El'-Baradei has declared that to the project of the constitution the place "is on dump of history".
Through a service of short news twitter he has accused proponents Mursi of a wish to head "putsch against democracy".
"If he announces referendum we shall go to his palace and we shall throw him - off", oppositionist Yasser Sahid has said.
"We haven't got tired yet our brothers' blood not otmshchena - yet", Egyptian the mass media of the oppositional politician *Haled* Ali cited.
Many judges have also reported that they don't want to observe referendum, which would make him invalid.
"Koran is our constitution"
Orderly "Brothers-Muslims" in their turn have well called to opposite demonstration, but, from precaution, not on Takhrir area, but after the mass prayer on the other shore of Nile in front of the Cairo university.
The large number of women under the coverlets and the proponents salafitov who cried: "the People required an application of a divine law" in her has taken part.
They have required of Mursi: "Refine a country", and have been assured: "Koran is our constitution".!
The struggle for the power over the symbolic area with which all has begun on has provoked state of a practically civil war.
Followers Mursi quite obviously didn't want to walk this risk.
"Brothers-Muslims" have declared that both the opponents, and the partisans of the project of the constitution have spoken out loudly and clearly.
The time to allow a people solve at a ballot-box in what direction the country must go has now come.
Majority are behind the project of the Islamists, it reckons by the solved affair.
"The notion "of human right" is mentioned never"
*Hafiz* which in general had to last for *Aba* Saeda in fury towards this forced constitutional process before February with participation of all public forces.
The lawyer in human rights, 48 year-old, and the chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOPR) protected "Brothers-Muslims", when with Mubarak they sat in a prison or appeared from a court.
Not because, what he divided their world outlook, and therefore human rights for it are indivisible.
For it he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never occur in the new constitution, it regrets in a talk "with Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi influence all three branches of the power in the state disappoints a lawyer.
These measures are the obvious blows at the democratic rules of a game and will bring the Egyptians to new dictatorship.
"Instead of the fact to reinforce the civil state the president de facto annuled him" - Saeda regrets.
However without the civil public organizations the democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everybody has abandoned him, even the international community which sees ideological struggle of the directions on Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
Forfeit can begin for it.
The demonstrator on Takhrir area warns: "you create the monster you whom won't be able to monitor".

Norwegian rakfisk: the most badly smelling fish in the world?
At the five million population of Norway one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe, but in the whole world.
Somehow is the perhaps mystery of success of this country connected with local predilection for one exceedingly rank fish dish?
Take several pieces of cheese that have become overripe.
Place them into heap of the dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
The smell rakfiska - of one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies striking smell you will be able.
I am in the small small town by name Fagernes in three hours of ride from Oslo.
Round there are the picturesque kinds, covered with snow, It very beautiful, but in air poured out ineradicable characteristic smell.
It is a Rakfisk - trout is strewn with a salt and being wandering around water before a year, into dependence from what just that odour it is necessary to attain.
As twilight thickens, and it grows colder, the crowds of the Norwegians gather on festival in Fagernese, dedicated to it itself, the dish, we shall say so, capturing.
"She is eaten with raw and takes to drink the wineglass of aquavit, local caraway vodka" -, Khavard Khal'varsen, explains, the local fireman is by a profession and in pluralism "the rakfiskovyj general" which leads execution of festival.
Everywhere around us the people eat a fish, sliced off the small cubes, and wash her down with the considerable portions of alcohol.
"Aquavit more pleases than rakfisk - Khavard speaks somebody".
This beverage is capable of interrupting smell.
I taste a couple of pieces.
If it proves possible to carry a piece under the nose then everything is not so already and badly - in few things differ from the portion of the dry spell which you long carried with it in a bus.
Rakfisk - it is Norwegian product from quite different times, times of poverty, when before appearance of the refrigerators yet the fish in autumn was soaked in the hermetically closed barrels with salty water.
Then in deep winter, when the fish already well and solidly began, to ferment she was extracted and, fading down perception by alcohol, used into food.
On the memory of the past generation yet it is that fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced abandon the country in search for work and emigrate in the main way to the USA.
Now the population swiftly grows - the immigrants whom the work places, the high salaries and a developed system of a social support carry here are more than 13 %.
The inhabitants of Sweden (long-standing the rival, and yet not so long ago, and more are able of a well-off neighbour) in a mass come here to work.
Rakfisk is perceived, an element of the past of Norway is as a certain important symbol, indispensable, just also somewhat rank.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand here everything is expensive - the small goblet of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds sterling (14 US dollars).
Norway seldom appears in world news, and, it seems, the majority of the inhabitants of a country make it.
The people here hitherto reluctantly mention name Andersa Brejvika of the racist and an extremist of the right use in the last year that has shot and has killed 77 men, the women and the children.
Not mentioning his name terrorist action is named "having happened on 22 July".
To the Norwegians come to believe that in their peaceable country one of their fellow citizens has turned out capable of similar brutalities and murders is very difficult.
Growth (from the beginning of the seventieth) of one of the largest oil and gas branches in the world provides basis of today's well-being of Norway.
"Petroleum - is not however sole the cause of our prosperity" - Anna, says, our waitress, is a woman, delivering the trays with self-possessed rakfiskom, with the thick light hair and the strikingly blue eyes incarnation of Nordic well-being.
How you name - it we are such a people - prudent.
As also the Norwegians' majority she beautifully speaks English.
We don't like to be exhibited on a show, we are not boastful.
Norway very sparingly handles its petroleum - the large part of the incomes of oil and gas branch is invested in a special fund, created for good of the future generations.
In the years that were preceding the world financial crisis, when everybody littered money which they hadn't, Norway parsimoniously counted all expenditures.
"As long as it is possible to roll the skis in winter and go into expeditions in summer it is sufficiently happiness" -, Anna speaks.
"And rakfisk, - is", she adds with unconcerned laughter.
I stand in a queue for some food - from me there will be enough rakfiska in snow.
A hamburger with elk meat - exotics here is it is the already precise tasty juicy meat.
But the else *greater* whole quantity of the same fish with unforgettable smell in the evening expects us.
The special dedicated supper, rakfisk in the process of which the visitors by the voting define best or, the, perhaps, most flavourous fish is conducted in my hotel.
Live TV broadcast in which the host in tie-butterfly of surrounded with the plates from rakfiskom is shown takes place.
It is similar to the song competition "Eurovision".
"Thus, what grade Torus-Yurgen have you delivered behind the best fish there with you in the mountains"?
"Yes Khavard our estimation is here"….
Everybody laughs and applauds.
Somebody falls from a chair perhaps, sorting out aquavit.
And can just inhaling this fish's smell.

The president of Mexico is in for Enrique Pen'ya N'eto the uneasy beginning of career.
As long as newly elected president of Mexico Enrique Pen'ya N'eto prepares to take on job correspondent of BBC Uill Grant invites us to glance at the difficulties he will have to with which collide, and mixed expectations of the population of its country.
Road movement is in the Mexico city now in the especially deplorable state.
This city is supercharged with a transport also in the best time, and from Monday the steel barriers, that were cutting several key mains to the capital and having caused chaos on the roads were erected.
However it wasn't made not to allow the people get from the suburbs on work but to hamper the participants of the protests in getting to a building of the parliament.
On Sunday the new head of Mexico Enrique Pen'ya N'eto will put on a presidential baldric and will receive the reins of the government of a country.
Not a simple task faces him.
Mexico has attained the good economic indexes at the administration Felipe of *Calderon* which now folds its authorities, however the country weltered in the war with the drugs which in six years has already carried off about 60.000 lives.
"My government declares the people of Mexico its readiness to struggle with violence" -, a gentleman of Singing of N'eto reported earlier in this week to president of the USA Barak Obama in an oval office of the White house.
I am going to propose a new strategy of the security which will allow us to achieve this aim.
Before such declarations next to the president of the USA political career of the gentleman of Singing of N'eto developed at an office of a governor of his native state of the Mexico city.
At his home, in the populous and vast state, surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new leader have divided.
A rectilinear person
In the idyllic small town of Val'e-it is de-Dashing, for example, him recollects with heat.
The inhabitants place him a reanimation of tourism, the development of health resort sphere and creation of infrastructure into merit.
To to the city get from over one is possible new the grams, for the highway built, *THE*th of Singing of N'eto which strikingly differ from the roads with the dents and the pits which were earlier at this place.
The tablets with its name hang on a modern building of the sports center and on an impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climatic changes.
"We connect hopes for real and serious changes - with him", his friend and political ally Gabriel Ol'vera Ernandes, the congressman of the state from headed of Singing N'eto of an institutional-revolutionary batch (PRI) speak.
We expect the present and resolute changes which so sharply are necessary for our country of primarily the domain of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous term of office the party PRI was forced out in 2000 Visente Fox.
Congressman Ol'vera recognizes that after his 12 summer absence in a presidential palace of Los-Pinos the party sets ardent hopes for Enrique Pen'ya N'eto.
Besides that he refutes the accusations of inanity which opposition has made the new president.
He is very rectilinear and is very devoted to a task of incarnation of his vision of the future of the country.
It is the excellent state worker, and, *CAN1* listen to the primarily people.
But in the other part of the state with many people the other idea of the former governor has been formed.
Municipality Nesaual'kojotl', known also by the name of S'yudad-Nesa, most striking contrast with paved streets Val'e-shows, de-Dashing.
Concealed under the overpasses of the highways he in many senses is the suburb of the Mexico city itself.
And the problems in a municipality too have the strong character of this megapolis.
Before the troops; and violence with respect to the women in this year for pacification of the gangs, vending the drugs in these districts, were attracted, the specially sharp character wears here.
Several tens of the killed women's bodies were detected on a vacant plot near vast dump only in the last two years.
More a thousand women were killed in the state of the Mexico city during governorship of the gentleman of Singing of N'eto - it significantly exceeds the similar index in the city of S'yudad-Khuares the name of which has become the nominal, when the speech enters about the murder of the innocent women that has sadly become famous for violence.
According to the words of the opponents of a gentleman of Singing of N'eto to about him say he hasn't managed to cope with the problem of the murder of the women is in the best case possible what time of the stay at the governor's office.
In the worst case its administration is accused of fully ignoring of this problem.
The inhabitant of concrete is at home similar to the majority of the houses in this decrepit district Irineya Buendiya with difficulty, restrain the tears showing to me, daughters Mariany Moon are the photographs of own of the deceased.
According to an official version of Mariana in 2010 have committed suicide.
However her family believes that her has killed her cohabitant.
"When I got to her house was similar that her body in front of it had been washed" -, Mrs. Buendiya recollects.
The signs of the fact that it has been beaten, were, and the body is narrower numbly.
Mother Mariany retells this history, and the daughter's portrait sees us from a wall where he hangs by next to the crucifixion on which in all one word: justice is inscribed.
This family according to their words was refused just it.
"The officials of the state handled me as with an old gossiper, the discontented violator of calm.
They want the people to just admit everything that they say, and kept silent on belief.
But it is wrong, so impossible when especially round so there are many violations and the shortages" -, she speaks.
Putting on a presidential baldric on Saturday the president of Singing of N'eto together with her will take uneasy responsibility on himself.
In the last six years tens of thousands of families in Mexico affected crimes, connected with violence, and the new president promised to make a solution of this problem priority during their government.
"I hope that he will be the exactly same president a congressman what was governor" -, Ol'vera speaks, from Val'e-de-Dashing from the party PRI.
The families of the victims in S'yudad-Nesa however most of all fear just it.

Bredli Manning didn't complain about bad appeal, accusation declares.
The prosecutors try to refute the declarations Bredli Manning about the bad conditions of content is under guard.
In the process of hearing increased attention was spared Manning's stay in a military prison into Kvantiko, the state is Virginia.
Protection requires to close an affair on that base that the conditions of confinement of Manning were cruel.
The USA accuse the private of an army of stealing of several thousand secret documents.
On Friday tried to prove accusation of, a the, that private Bredli Manning, accused the largest leakage of the classified materials into stories of the USA, haven't used set possibilities to give a complaint about the bad appeal which according to his words has *have_occasion* him transfer being in a military prison.
During cross interrogation there is Forth-on the prejudicial hearing in the Foreign Ministry the military prosecutor major Eshden Fejn has lodged that the recordings of the weekly visits to Manning by the representatives of the administration of a prison in nine months of its content in the state of Virginia, Kvantiko, the complaints about bad appeal aren't contained the state of Maryland.
The cross interrogation within the framework of consideration of intercession of protection for cessation of an affair of Manning on the base of the fact that the conditions of its confinement were cruel and in itself was sufficient punishment was conducted for the next day after Manning has declared that being in custody it intended to commit suicide.
The military specialist in analysis of the intelligences, the prisoner is in June 2010 is accused of stealing of several thousand secret documents during a service in Iraq.
These materials were hereafter published on the Internet on the site WikiLeaks.
The resource WikiLeaks hasn't confirmed that just Manning was the source of information.
During hearing on Friday prosecutor Fejn has together with Manning viewed the reports which filled in after the visits to Manning by the representatives of an administration during his stay in prison Kvantiko, where he was on the conditions of a strict regime of confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
During attendances the serving prisons asked Manning the questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor Fejn asked on Friday about the reports Manning has recognized that appeal to himself on the part of the administration of a prison as "excellent", and the common conditions of confinement as "very professionally orderly" estimate.
The considered reports don't contain the complaints about bad appeal notwithstanding the fact that Manning was straight asked about the conditions of its content, Fejn asserts.
Manning has answered that he expressed oral concern with these problems his representatives that what were also visiting of an administration discussed these problems with it and declared that they would start to be dealt, but didn't fix it in the writing kind.
"They recorded "the problems were absent" (after discussion of my complaints), but it doesn't mean that I didn't raise this theme in a talk" -, Manning speaks.
Military the judge, the colonel, the De bottom, Lind, have too asked Manning why one didn't complain, on illegal appeal with it in January 2011, the suitsidal'nye intentions which it expressed by the the that during a session commission was considering writing kind behind is several months before that old.
Manning has answered that during that session it wanted to attain that from him has been removed a mode "of traumatism prevention", and the conditions of confinement have been softened.
The representatives of the military leadership have explained that the the limited mode of confinement - on level below than is a mode of supervision with a view on prevention of suicide - was brought in for the protection of a prisoner, as well as for the sake of security of other.
"I wanted to allow an administration must know that with me still in an order, so that they cancel a mode of traumatism… prevention, that, the level of my life has improved from my viewpoint" -, Manning has explained.
On Thursday Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and a translation to Kuwait where almost two months contained him before have been transfered to a prison in a naval base into Kvantiko, the state of Virginia, is in July 2010.
He has reported that the ideas of suicide have occurred to it in Kuwait, and that has once it lost consciousness because of high heat.
He has explained that it psychologically is very hard, when you don't let know how your fate, resolves, and what happens in the external world.
"My world has contracted before a base of Kemp-Arifzhan before the sizes of my prison -, Manning on Thursday has said.
-I thought that I would die in this cage".
Finding in Kvantiko, Manning, according to his words, conducted the large part of the time in a small chamber - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours per twenty four hours - in full solitude.
Manning reports that for him it has been permitted to leave only a mattress, the blanket, several items of the clothes and the spectacles are the bedroom slippers.
He says that he tried to move, for to sleep or even just lie in daytime forbade the rules.
The light, penetrating outside a chamber, according to the words of Manning during sleep, him permanently beat at the eyes.
If the guards didn't see his face, when it turned over in a bed in the night then according to his words he was awakened and made turn over to the back.
Manning's lawyer has given official objection concerning illegal treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011 Manning was transfered to a military prison into Forth-Livenvort, the state of Kansas.
Besides that on Friday the judge inquired Manning about the declaration which he has made during testification on Thursday of the fact that after in the night it was once made to sleep stripped in his chamber into Kvantiko, he has been starved into to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners on the morning checkup.
Manning has declared that he hadn't a possibility to cover oneself with a blanket during a checkup.
Answering with the questions of a judge on Friday Manning has said that he has understood from an order of the guard that it must throw a blanket with which would be able to cover oneself but have recognized that nobody straight ordered to it to throw him.
On Thursday Manning declared that in the previous night it had been made to sleep naked because of his attempt to show to an officer that he doesn't constitute danger for himself.
Manning has reported that he has told the officer that he would be able to use the cowards' elastic or the bedroom slippers to traumatize himself, but haven't made it.
In that night according to Manning's evidence his bottom linen, the bedroom slippers and the spectacles took away from a chamber.
His lawyers hope that the judge at least will take the fact that it has had to outlive during confinement, and considerably will reduce a term of confinement if Manning is recognized as culpable by the military court which must begin consideration of its affair at the beginning of the next year into account.
Protection has declared that it plans to propose to Manning to recognize guilt of less serious crimes, and dispute other accusations as excessive.
The resumption of hearings is planned for this weekend, it is expected that the side of accusation will insist on the fact that the conditions of keeping in custody were justified.
Pentagon asserts that Manning was present in Kvantiko in accordance with the rules, adjusting keeping of the prisoners with a maximally strict regime.
Pandering for Manning to an opponent, illegal assistance to promulgation in the a furnished Internet transfer information, concerning national defense, and stealing of the state property or the documents are reckoned among made accusations.
If he is condemned over all points of the accusatory act life imprisonment can threaten him.

My crisis of national self-determination - the American's short story is of Mexican origin.
In the author's opinion many Mexicans were forced abandon Mexico because of the absence of the possibilities to realize oneself.
The Mexicans are apt to accuse ones who have left, because they remind the inhabitants of a country complicated times.
*Ruben* Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin burst between two cultures.
During a recent journey to the Mexico city I have gone around a corridor for coming, have approached a zone of the border control and have congealed at a place.
The signs pointed two queues: alone for Mexicanos (the Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (the foreigners).
I was faced several seconds with them not knowing where to walk.
I have grown in the central California, and I was named the whole life the Mexican.
This just conditional name, like how my friends in Boston name themselves the Irishmen, and the friends from New York believe themselves the Italians.
I have later stopped on a complicated construction "American of Mexican origin".
But here I was in Mexico.
The need for the conditional names or the complicated constructions wasn't here, at my grandfather's home.
I was just the American.
I say in the Spanish way to ask the questions or answer sufficiently with good for that them.
But my dictionary reserve is poorer than that of the carriers of a language, and I cannot get rid of an American accent.
I have therefore come and have stood into a queue for Extranjeros by my American passport.
I recollected this history several days ago, when again elected president of Mexico Enrique Pen'ya N'eto visited the White house and has met president Obama.
The questions: about immigration, the drugs and trade, habitual for the meetings with the presidents of these countries, stood on agenda.
The president of Singing of N'eto willingly spoke rise of Mexican economy due to which, the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico instead of the fact to get across to the United States.
He wants to sign an agreement on the partnership with the USA and Canada and create a certain north American trading block like the European Union.
Besides that the president of Singing of N'eto has promised to continue a war against the drug cartels in Mexico, no particular offers have however sounded.
For Mexico relations with the United States are the heavy and full of old resentments question.
The Americans' majority have never pondered the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and under the muzzle of the rifles have forced her leaders to decline the half of its territory.
But the Mexicans think the centuries, and not the minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
It therefore is worth missaying only any state worker the USA by just the word of criticism to a side of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society the complaints about the fact that the Americans encroach upon sovereignty of the neighbours here sound.
And the descendants are filled by bellicosity with Monte's bag.
Relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin, living in the USA, in this case are the most complicated.
Do you want to speak about resentments?
They are sufficiently.
There in Mexico are winners and the people who find in this country for themselves of the possibility, and ones for whom there are no such possibilities that have lost.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is so many people of Mexican origin only for one cause: at some moment of their family story anybody is a father or is a grandfather - hadn't a possibility to realize himself in Mexico and was forced depart to the north.
The most often of all it was the Mexicans of definite type - swarthy, insufficiently well-educated from the poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about it.
It is seen in Mexico otherwise.
Today our life - it is incarnation of American dream we studied at the good schools and have settled down on good works, but us not forget the fact that even this dream - American, and not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is entangled and it is unclear, but we know what country to believe own.
The united States of America.
Besides we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite of the also governing class don't love us.
We answer with the same to them.
They see reminder of the humiliating defeats in us and treat us as to the people of the second sort as to the factitious Mexicans.
We insufficiently well speak Spanish, and our connections with Mexico are insufficiently strong.
Our existence for them itself is explained with the failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico they wouldn't leave.
We wouldn't turn out now behind the silk curtain, finding full life in the USA but losing the spiritual connections.
My wife has been born in Guadalajara and has legally moved to the USA as far back as in childhood, and reminds of it me the fact that between the real Mexicans and the Americans of Mexican origin exist definite frictions - the Mexicans more distinctly understand their national identity, and Mexican origin it it hurts the Americans.
She the citizen of the USA also believes, which to both these countries belongs.
In the same time many my familiar Americans of Mexican origin feel belonging not to one of them.
We listen to a Mexican group of Los Tigres del Norte, but we love also Bruce Springstina.
Receiving the best from two worlds you unavoidably lose roots.
In Mexico we are the Americans.
And in the USA we are named the Mexicans.
Now, as I have elucidated during my journey, as though our relations without that insufficiently is entangled, some Mexican leaders and the representatives of the intelligentsia want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin to work as the their kind ambassadors of Mexico and awaked her interests to the USA.
We would be able to tell our friends-Americans about it is what beautiful country also as to visit her superbly is, and the political leaders could be persuaded to strengthen the connections with Mexico.
It aha is finite.
Nothing will be produced.
Resentments in the past are too much.
And taking rupture of the rich and poor, rampancy of corruption and drug trade, into account many of us quite don't believe this country of such already beautiful.
Excuse, but understand it oneself, amigos.
And it is just.
If the Mexicans' part hitherto cannot forgive the United States that how they have treated Mexico, one and a half centuries ago, they will have to receive, and it is that fact that some Americans of Mexican origin all in resentment that in Mexico have how quite recently treated their kinsmen yet.
Yes already.
Perhaps with us more common than to me seemed.

The old battles are in the new Middle East
The agreement on cessation of a fire between Israel and grouping of the Hamas can become the fragile foundation for the farther world
Is long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelis in the Middle East possible?
The next round pushes bloodsheds from a conclusion of futility of such hopes.
One sounds, who is the first have started; meaningless arguments on that that have become habitual, the set of the buildings is converted into ruins; six Israelis; the rockets, for the first time in the time of a conflict, launched from the territory of sector Gaza, have fallen into killed above 140 Palestinians whose majority have been the civil faces, and vicinity of the capital of Israel of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Changes however notwithstanding the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians have hopelessly bogged their conflict since early *TIME1* have come to the Middle East.
Is to possible treat it differently, the events "of Arab spring" have however begun to whirl in a rebellious storm a set of realities that have settled down, and the Palestinians and the Israelis haven't succeeded in remaining aside from whirlwind that has shocked the region.
By what, perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even bloodier earlier.
The causes, giving hope for an exit from this deadly lockup, however exist.
A war without the winners
On the first glance the situation that has been formed doesn't give the causes of optimism.
Even if the cessation of the fire on which the agreement was signed on 21 November realizes itself collisions that have happened in this week have only strengthened the positions of the power structure people from both sides.
The leaders of islamistic movement of the Hamas that has come to the power in sector Gaza in 2007, will be declared, from, the fact that they have forced Israel to retreat notwithstanding suffered by them losses.
Notwithstanding the fact that some leaders of a group were destroyed, and the inhabitants are blocked with 1,7 million in one of the most populous and problem corners of our planet Israel hasn't succeeded in destroying the Hamas.
In fact the Hamas accrues its popularity on the West bank of the river Jordan - one more Palestinian territory, monitored currently by the more moderate movement of the Fatah.
More than that the leaders of the Hamas quite can draw a conclusion that the time works in them.
The new influential and rich friends in the process of growth of influence of islamistic movements in the Arab world appear at the Hamas.
The regenerating regional the leader Turkey which long ago was the nearest ally of Israel among the Muslim countries, has come forward with a support of the Hamas; its example, Qatar, has followed, one of richest and is dynamic developing states of the Persian gulf.
The triumphing partisans of the Hamas declare the Hizballah about creation around Israel of an islamistic crescent - from Lebanon in the north in which the militarized group governs before Syria the in whom, still more are further before Jordan, where the authorities of the king are the proislamistic insurgents very soon will overthrow power Bashar Assada, and the allies of the Hamas threaten.
The the most significant change of balance of forces has occurred in the region on the southern borders of Israel, in the itself populous and important Arab country, in Egypt where the influence of movement Fraternity-the Muslims with president Muhammed Mursi has hardened.
Khosni Mubarak who governed Egypt during 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator that wasn't giving close attention to a support of the Hamas.
Brothers-Muslims conversely are an organization, in much similar to the Hamas, and their leaders are apter to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements the Hamas can become a significant player whose voice even Israel and America won't succeed in choking.
In the same time the partisans of a "rigid" line in Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In a military sense the Hamas was plunged.
The Israeli antimissile system "the Iron dome" has justified expenditures for its creation and has successfully destroyed many of the rockets, launched by the Hamas.
The citizens of Israel can sleep calmly, at least some is time.
What concerns diplomacy the USA have remained faithful to their invariant position; many European countries have also laid guilt of the beginning of the last round of violence on the Hamas.
One more important factor is economic prosperity of Israel especially push forward the government Bin'yamina Netanyahu who to a significant extent ignored a peaceful process.
Notwithstanding the fact that since 2004 approximately 30 Israelis have been killed from the rockets, launched from the territory of sector Gaza, Israel has succeeded in reducing the problem of the terrorists-kamikazes partly at the expense of the wall which enters the territory of the West bank of the river Jordan - the significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements which continue to be expanded notwithstanding illegality of such actions from a viewpoint of international legislation to the minimum.
The position of prime minister Netanyahu, Likud whose party are within the framework of preparation for the election - have united with the conservatives, even more aggressively inclined, under the leadership of Avigdor Liberman planned for 22 January very comfortable.
What sense to connive with the Palestinians and present the own state to them?
If give back the whole power in the territory of the West bank into their arms won't they begin to launch a rocket from there to a side of Israel, as do their brothers in sector Gaza make it?
It is better to keep them behind a wall and rigidly suppress any attempts to raise the heads.
Perhaps the partisans of a "rigid" line will win a victory; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
The internal problems at the fact that the Islamists who come to the power in Egypt and other countries feel not the warmest emotions about Israel will become their priority task.
The defense part of a budget of Israel is larger than that of its all Arab neighbours together taken.
Untying of a war with a regional superpower hardly will help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen own economy.
Pragmatism of the president of Egypt Mursi which jointly with Barak Obama worked on cessation of a fire is a good sign and can mark the beginning of changes with itself.
Israel to a not smaller extent must take long-term consequences of its policy into account.
In the process of approach of democratic changes of the Arab countries deprivation of the Palestinians of self-determination right is the bomb of delayed action which early or late will explode in the occupied by Israel territories, like a bus, exploded in Tel Aviv in this week.
The repressions already blow up fundamentals of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is growth of the Arab population - only aggravate these problems.
For the bloody operations which are performed each several years in the territory of sector Gaza for suppression of movement of the Hamas one has to pay with growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need the external impulse
Remains the sole solution for which tirelessly the sensible representatives from both sides, as well as the large part of the remaining world and our newspaper: formation of two states and concessions by Israel of the territories in exchange for security call.
Hope, not too imposing in short-term prospect, - hope what cessation of a fire will allow other countries remain, it is more effective to influence the sides of the conflict.
Egypt is a for which long ago time to make decision to overlap deliveries of the weapons sector Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have an advantageous position to persuade the Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, accepted since the year 1967 of the one that considers exchange of the territories and joint use of Jerusalem, at its disposal as never.
Other Arab countries also must make the efforts conciliation of movements of the Hamas and the Fatah.
It would make more for creation of the Palestinian state than the forthcoming voting in the UN result of which confession virtual statehood of Palestine can become.
Also president Obama must play his role in the fact to seat Israel at a table of negotiations.
During his first term he after all hasn't presented an own plan of peaceful settlement.
After return from the White house he, as before, demonstrates unwillingness to switch to a solution of a given problem.
It is a catastrophically shortsighted position.
The united States are vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
It is possible only in a case of the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia the law of a unified package for the cigarettes has entered force.
The warnings about harm of smoking and the image of struck with the diseases of the parts of the body are contrastively allocated on the cheerless green boxes, similar for all trademarks of the cigarettes.
The first in world practice Australian law of a similar package of the cigarettes and the tobacco articles has entered into force, replacing the logotypes and the coloured finalization of the different trademarks the similar box of cheerless-olive colour of the eery photographs of the parts of the body, struck with a disease, and with the children's images, the health of which are blown up by smoking of their parents.
Besides the different pictures and the inscriptions, warning the sole distinction between the packets of harm of smoking, brought in in an obligatory order from this Saturday - the name of the marks which are printed by the similar shallow font.
It is the conditions of finalization of the packages of the tobacco articles, sternest in the world.
The federal government of Australia declares that it is aim of this measure to retain the youth smoking depriving this bad habit of the fashionable status.
Results of investigations that have shown that the people that haven't begun to smoke before 26 years in 99 cases from 100 so never also became the smokers have lain down into basis of such a solution.
"It is obvious that even at the youngest age the children understand the sense which the tobacco companies try to bring with the help of finalization of a package" -, health minister Tanya Plibersek explains refering to investigations that have shown that, for example the crown in a logotype associated itself with the children with the princess' idea.
Australia is one of the countries from least in the world of the smokers' shares, so that these changes not specially tell on the profit of the transnational corporations, also the different countries however consider the possibility of taking of similar measures already.
The representatives of tobacco industry intensively counteracted acceptance of this law.
The tobacco companies assert that it only will increase a share of the black market on which the cheap and accessible cigarettes will sell themselves.
"This law will have serious consequences, different from ones who were conceived by his originators" - Scott Makintajr, the representative of a company of British American Tobacco in Australia believes.
The producers of false produce from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for a sale in the streets of Australia.
For somebody conversely new laws contribute to growth of business.
Sandra Kha from the small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd assert that how the demand for the cigarette cases and the silicon etuis, concealing the disagreeable pictures on a package, swiftly, has grown (practically from zero) since two months ago such companies of British American Tobacco British Imperial Tobacco Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco has lost a case in a high court of Australia where tried to appeal against a given law.
According to the words of Sandra Kha the company of Zico has already realized about six thousand articles of wholesale trade to the enterprises and expects a new batch.
For us it is good business.
Popularity of social networks among just that part of the population on which these measures are directed is in the experts' opinion potential hindrance to effectiveness of similar measures.
After acceptance in Australia of a series of laws that have made illegal TV advertisement of the cigarettes and a support by them of sports actions, as well as forbidding to the sellers to exhibit the cigarettes at a visible place advertisement of the tobacco articles has moved into the Internet.
The government of Australia has forbidden to the local companies and the websites to locate advertisement on network, but it cannot restrict the foreign sites in it.
"if *YOU* *VEND1* *tobacco* *ARTICLE1* *ALSO*/*EVEN1* *YOU* *HAVE* *ONLY1* this small *LOOP-HOLE*, *IDEA* *BE* *ADVANCE2*/*FURTHER* own *GOODS* on *INTERNET1* *SEEM* *YOU* extremely *tempting*", - *EXPLAIN* *bey* Friman, *INVESTIGATE*/*RESEARCH2* *QUESTION1* public/social *HEALTH* at *UNIVERSITY* *SYDNEY*.
Freeman notes growth of the number of reviews of the trademarks, written from the face of allegedly the common users, how there is YouTube on the such social networks for twitter and Facebook.
Does the question - whether this affair of the arms of the ordinary citizen who so likes cigarettes Marlboro that haven't pitied forces and the time and have made video, or does the advertising company stand behind it is actual arise?
The Australian section on a company of British American Tobacco asserts that now more are occupied by adaptation to the new rules with a branch than advertisement.
The representatives of tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsoring of the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for contestation of the new rules: these states make the complaint in the frames declaring that that trade has been subject to the world Trade organization unfair, the restrictions, notwithstanding the fact that trading relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
The solution of WTO is expected to the middle of 2013.
According to the words of Tanya Plibersek the government discussed a possibility of acceptance by them of analogous laws of a package with other countries.
In 2001 Canada introduced for the first obligatorily locating of the photographs, warning of harm of smoking.
Now this rule is received in more than 40 countries, including in Brazil, Turkey and the Ukraine.
The possibility of toughening of laws is considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, the Republic of South Africa and India.
The set of the smokers in Australia ostentatiously doesn't obey innovations.
These pictures don't graze me.
I just don't pay attention.
"You just snatch away a cigarette and you hide a packet to a pocket" -, Victor El' Khejg, buying the cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor of the oral cavity on a packet, explains.
It is honest saying the sole that can to make me throw - it is my small daughter.
James Ju, managing a shop of tobacco articles King of the Pack at the center of Sydney, asserts that the similar package has complicated a task of arrangement of goods from the regiments
"The hour, and now four hours - earlier with me went away, he complains, on unloading of a new batch".
"To take and quite forbid the cigarettes we close a shop -, he speaks throwing up the arms up, was is for the government necessary, we then would say: what it do, is well-formed everything was finished".

To miss in the world of electronic networks and the constants of wiring-ups - it is not so already is also bad.
In this Day of Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in an airport, because at our plane have transpired mechanical malfunctions and have replaced him with the other plane for which we also waited.
Thus with me it was sufficient the time of reflections on nature of boredom.
I shan't deceive you.
Half a day in an airport in expectation of a trip is indeed boring, and here neither the books nor the magazines, nor an iPhone, nor even the magazines of duty-free trade strongly will help.
However, in towards the last time still more scientists and the specialists children's development speak out in favour to boredom.
They say that in the definite situations for us and for our children not to miss so already is also bad.
It forces the brain to abstract on the interesting adjacent themes, which perhaps contributes to creation.
And since in the modern world we all permanently are in front of some screen, advantages of boredom pass by us.
Can it be for us necessary to strive boredom?
And.
And in the same time *ISN'T*.
We shall return some more to it.
Earlier I as also many believed that boredom was invention regarding recent times, when at the people appeared more free time.
It is not so, asserts Peter Tui, the professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, the author of a book "the Fascinating history of boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History Yale University Press of 2011)..
"In fact boredom can boast about very ancient history" -, he speaks.
On the walls the Latin inscriptions, about boredom dated the first century, are detected in Pompeii.
In this case the question about that, as we understand boredom remains open.
The problem in, John D.. speaks, Istvud what, understanding and vision of boredom are the adjunct-professor of the University York is in Ontario, Canada, often varied.
Studying the materials of investigations into this theme and asking a question for the target group there is a person professor Istvud and his colleague in 100, send to the next definition: boredom - it when the people "want, but cannot deal with the fact that would give them satisfaction".
The difference between boredom and apathy, he speaks, consists in the fact that the missing person doesn't make anything that would want to make.
One doesn't want at apathy to do anything.
The main thing in experienced boredom, he, speaks, this "violation of attention and deterioration of mood and a feeling of the fact that the time stretches slowly, connected with it".
Over a description boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However professor Istvud asserts that notwithstanding a possible connection between these states the missing people see the causes of the problems in the ambient world and circumstances, and the people experiencing depression, see the problems in himself.
It seems that we feel boring, when in fact we find it just difficult on something to concentrate occasionally to us.
In one's investigation "the Unoccupied mind: definition of boredom from a viewpoint of attention", professor Istvud, with the colleagues refer to the experiment, the published in September production of a magazine of Perspectives on Psychological Science carried out earlier, of which the participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine.
The participants alone heard also the loud sounds of broadcast, included in a neighbouring room, not relating to an affair, other heard the same sounds on low of loudness, so that it hardly was possible to disassemble them, and the third group listened only to a recording of the voice without the outside sound track.
Those participants who heard the TV set with the low level of loudness noted, by what they felt boring more often than other - they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn't know its cause and ascribed it to boredom.
When we try to concentrate attention in the difficult or fascinating task interruption of attention can cause boredom, Marc Dzh.. Fenske, the adjunct-professor of neurology at the University of *GVEL'F*, Ontario, and one of the authors of given investigation speaks.
On the other hand, when we make anything uninteresting, "for example scrutinizing a stream of the articles on a conveyor in search for defect distracting music can help to avoid boredom".
It is believed, he continues, that when the people begin to rock on a chair or draw scribble on a sheet of paper, they make it from boredom, however now we know that in fact such actions just help not to relax physically.
"The investigation has shown that the children who *ISN'T* forbidden to dodge about and revolve, study better and memorize more information than the children which require to sit quietly" -, professor Fenske asserts.
At some moments we all test boredom: in the delay of a trip (as in my case), listening to monotonic speech, viewing an uninteresting film.
However the different people demonstrate the different degree of inclination for boredom.
In the 1980th years for measurement of such individual peculiarities the researchers developed a special "scale of inclination for boredom".
The questions and, for example, "Much from the fact that I have to make assertion, monotonously and monotonously" or, "is too much interesting therefore there isn't enough for Me time anything" are used for definition of estimation by such a scale.
The with the help of such questionaries, the researchers have defined that the boys miss as more frequent than the girls, - Steven Vodanovich, the professor of psychology at the University of the Western Florida, - says especially push forward, presence of the versatile external irritants.
However on the whole the teenagers in general often miss.
There is Reed Larson in 1991, the professor of personality and public development at the University of Illinois, has carried out the experiment in the process of which he communicated almost with 400 teenagers and their parents of 7-8 times per day with the help of a pager.
He has received the next results: 32 % of teenagers have declared the fact that they feel boring is at a school and during execution of homework, and 23 % have declared the fact that they feel boring is beyond the limits of the school.
In this case only 3 % of parents have noted that they feel boring.
Professor Larson notes that he hasn't data which similar data on boredom would be now after 21 years.
However he knows that "on adolescent age falls a peak of inclination for boredom" in the main thing, because the children and the teenagers aren't allowed in the full measure to decide they must with what start to deal.
Shall we return to my initial question: boredom is useful?
Occasionally isn't, because in the extreme manifestations she, as investigations show, can push the people from absurd and dangerous in physical actions, the venturous gambling games or abuse of the definite substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand many philosophers and the writers pondered a connection between boredom and creation, professor Vodanovich that has dedicated to study of this problem more than two decades speaks.
"So our brain prompts us that it is necessary to start to deal with something else; it also is boredom" - Gary Markus, the professor of psychology at the New York university speaks.
However not always know this most brain, is with what just better to start to deal.
If you will feel boring, and you will direct this energy on a game at a guitar or culinary experiments, you will make for yourselves better.
However if you begin to see the TV set you will feel better only for some time, and soon it will elapse.
Therefore if your child misses, and you give an iPad to him he will stop missing, however he won't learn to struggle with boredom independently or somehow the other mode control his time and occupancy -, professor Fenske speaks.
"And such skills in independent adjustment are used for the most different situations" -, he asserts.
Your child studies not only independently to occupy himself with something, he also studies the *SELF1* control in general.
I don't think that to extoll boredom is necessary somehow.
It however isn't worth counting her in anything bad too.
It rather is necessary to study to feel comfortably even beyond a continuous stream of actions and technologies.
Professor Istvud agrees on it.
"We see it is so that it is for us necessary to more often test boredom at the fact that to start to deal with something meaningful - is the boredom is extremely disagreeable strong wish", he speaks.
In fact the people strive somehow tune out great cares and just relax.
"In the modern world we have got accustomed to permanent excessive stimulation of the organs of emotions -, he - speaks, and when silence, sets up, we get lost and we don't know that make".

It is so far unclear how the new law of legalization of marihuana in the state of Colorado will apply
Anthony Orosko, the nineteen year-old player of the football team and a student of a public college in the south-east of the state of Colorado is accused of committing of criminal crime, consisting in the fact that it soon will be perfectly lawful in the whole territory of the state: storage of the small portion of marihuana and the tube in which he smoked her.
Mr Orosko says that once in September he was with the friends into Lamare and went by automobile over a prairie near the border with Kansas, when them stopped the policemen.
After the policeman has detected marihuana in a machine Mr Orosko, summons to a court has come for storage of the drugs and possession of gadget use of the drugs - shallow delicts for each of which, a fine into is due the size of 100 dollars - and the date of the judicial session is appointed.
"One handles as with the criminals - us", Mr Orosko speaks.
But is he the criminal?
As a result of the ambiguity which continues already several weeks after the state of Colorado has voted for legalization of use of marihuana in small quantities for entertainment, the solution of hundreds of shallow judicial affairs doesn't depend so much from a law how much from a place of consideration.
Accusations of shallow delicts, connected with marihuana, film in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington which has taken analogous measure already.
The police areas have already stopped making accusations of the the people age are 21 years and are older for storage of small doses, which will come to be believed lawful, once across a couple of weeks the law will enter force, old.
In the more conservative districts of Colorado the prosecutors have however made a decision to consider the existing cases, connected with marihuana, and over previous make responsible for storage of this drug.
In the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain districts of the West is voted for the fact not to allow appearance in their places, new, licensed by the state of the magazines over a sale of marihuana.
"All of it develops so swiftly that I even don't know what to expect further" -, Daniel Dzh.. Outs speaks, the head of the police, there is Aurora in the east of Denver in the small town.
The representatives of the monitoring organs in the state of Washington too perplexed scratch the heads.
They are in for forming of the rules for definition, about licensing of breeding, treatment, dissemination, both are the sales of marihuana, and to all of it make before 1 December 2013 is necessary.
They say that Colorado, it is or it is bad good outpaces the majority of other states settlement of the questions of marihuana use at first in medical aims, and now for entertainment.
"There is a more ordered market in Colorado, therefore they will serve as a good example" -, Bryan I.. Smith, the representative of the council for adjustment of production and a sale of alcoholic produce in the state of Washington explains.
But now nobody can make more, Mr Smith recognizes, than make some offers and hope that it will work.
"We haven't real precedent to which we would be able to orientate - oneself", he speaks.
Bill of the state of Washington I-502, is named, will enter force 6 December and for the entire year will plunge the state in state of ambiguity, when of the system, there is no state-licensing more, and the right of marihuana possession is legitimated already.
And exist however not the else simple technical aspects is to which necessary solve in this period, for example as find equilibrium between an order of the state "for adequate access" to licensed marihuana with a ban on her trade at the distance of 1000 ft from the schools, the parks, the playing platforms and the kindergartens.
"It will be especially complicated to locate the licensed enterprises of marihuana trade in a line of the cities in particular in Seattle and its suburbs" -, Ben Livingston, the representative of the recently formed research group "Center of marihuana legalization" explains.
On 21 November the head of the police Outs sent a message of the fact that the prosecutor's office of the city more won't make the faces that have been at the age of 21 years responsible for possession of the small quantity of marihuana, and that the police stop proving the people guilty of given violations "beginning with this moment" from Aurora to his subordinates by an e-mail.
The head of the police Outs has reported that the police will watch observance in the city of the rules, adjusting activity of the faces, breeding marihuana in medical aims, and will pursue the illegal dealers and the spreaders of the drugs.
The prosecutor of a district of Ueld in the north of Colorado, Ken Bak, presents a stricter approach to this question.
After a voting over a bill he has declared that the prosecutor's office will make as before responsible for possession of marihuana in the main way to impel her using persons to study course for treatment.
At a given moment accusations of storage against two and ounces of marihuana, are although many of them are accused also of other violations less are made 119 faces.
"It is duty of our institution to pursue for the actions which are believed criminal at a moment of of them accomplishment" -, Mr Tank in the declaration has said.
The reaction was ambiguous even in such places as Mesa rural district where the participants of a voting have refused offer of marihuana legalization.
The police Grandee Dzhankshn more don't make the largest city in a district responsible the adults for possession of the small quantity of drug.
District prosecutor Pete Khauttsinger has supported this solution, but has also decided not to drop accusations in even the open affairs, connected with storage of marihuana.
"I believe that to insure observance of a law, until it varies is our direct duty" -, he speaks.
Notwithstanding the fact that 55 % of inhabitants of the state are Colorado, this solution, inclusion of the questions of use of marihuana for entertainments into the state and legal system have supported having taken part in a voting won't be simple.
And the inhabitants' contradictory reaction in the different places of the state has stripped ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to experiment of the state with marihuana.
"The cultural barrier - with the district prosecutors exists, explains Sean McAllister, the Denver lawyer, awaking the convicts' interests for storage of marihuana, and the local representative of the National organization of reformation of laws over marihuana, in this question".
"They so long prosecuted the people for it, that now cannot really reconcile oneself with that that it *BE* already not the crime" -, he speaks.
Colorado and Washington - the first states in which the marihuanas relate to small quantity as as to alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field in a scale of the country for a checkup of the idea of legalization of the drugs itself.
The partisans of legalization and the officials of the state, it is planned to expand the territory of legalized trade, but in the same time, they with caution expect indications from federal the authorities which are as before, volplane to consider a sale and breeding of marihuana as federal crimes.
The partisans of marihuana legalization hope that the Control will be inferior to justice in this question.
The federal government in the majority of the cases has given notwithstanding several arrests of the dealers and the patients that have received wide resonance being using marihuana over the medical testimonies for trade in marihuana in medical aims in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states kindly.
The agents of a Bureau of struggle with the drugs hardly will break in into the houses to confiscate small the small package the marihuanas, however they hardly will begin to close the eyes with the shops, adjusted by the authorities of the state, which resolved according to a new law, Kevin A.. Sabet, the former adviser on the questions of struggle with the drugs in the administration of Obama believes, of recreational marihuana.
Any cities in Colorado wouldn't wait for actions of the federal authorities.
Before the presidential election yet some local administrations have approved of a moratorium on the discovery of the new shops over a sale of marihuana which also so wouldn't be able to open earlier than in a year.
The *of_six_months*/*six-month* ban on marihuana trade which in all probability will be approved in the next week in the last week of Montrouz put forward consideration the city in the western part of the state.
"We don't want to turn out in such a position that we shall give to somebody a license, and then it will cause the serious problems at the federal level" -, Bob Nikolson, the member of the urban council speaks.
Our city has voted against this correction.
Contradiction between results of the local voting and that for what the state has voted also now with us is evident.
Else very many unsolved questions remain.

Petronella Uajett: I have been forced out from Oxford for the fact that I am a conservative.
Prosecutions of the students of the universities for their glances have begun not today.
How much I remember myself, I always dreamt about entering the *Oxford* university.
My father and the elder brother studied in Oxford and described him as the training institution, best in the world, the modern analog of ancient symposium, laying two fundamentals of a civilization, is free thinking and is tolerance.
Nevertheless after two weeks of learning of the historical faculty Vusterskogo of the college of the Oxford university at the end of the eightieth, I have packed the suitcases and have left, which has poured out into the first real scandal in my life.
My father hasn't withstood and has begun to weep.
The friends were muddled up.
The newspaper of The Evening Standard asserted that I had given up a college, because I haven't liked that my classmates make love in a neighbouring room.
The writer E.. Northman Wilson joked that I had left, because I had to drink from the chippy cups.
In fact everything was not so amusing.
I have run down.
Yes have run down because I was systematically hunted down and intimidated.
Quite not because of my enough unusual name or the fact that I studied at a private school.
I was hunted down only for one cause, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment it looked real barbarity and blind fanaticism: my father, the now deceased Vudro Uajett, were known adviser Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was the conservatives' partisan.
Will you ask what for to to recollect it now?
According to the latest data the new generation of the students, sticking to right-centrist glances, is subject to the the same baiting.
This institutionalized and permanently growing hate for students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that in the last week the group of such students required the same protection of its rights as one who presents himself to the invalids for sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives from the student club of the college Building of Christie in Cambridge declare that they "often actively isolate them, subject to the personal assaults and make feel like the unwished guests" because of their political views.
They want to bring in an additional representative to a committee for equal rights of the college to insure freedom of expression of their opinion.
Their situation has only aggravated a 2 documentary film about the politician in student medium "Country of the miracles: young, clever and right" in whom the conservatives have been represented as the eccentrics and the neo-Nazis, having gone out recently to BBC.
In a film Joe Cook, the former president of an Association of the conservatives of the Oxford university which rides in Rolls-Royce, wears the silver suit and a walking-stick with the silver knob was shown.
At other universities students-conservatives complain that they make "the goats of absolution because of an increase of pay for learning" of them.
The hatch of Blek of 20 years, the vice-president of an Association of the conservatives of the Nottingham university in an interview of one of the Sunday newspapers have said that "in university medium skewness to a side of the left glances increases.
The people who even don't know us beforehand believe us the impudent and with impunity wild children of the rich parents".
Samuel Roberts, the the the the petition for strengthening of protection, student historical faculty college Building Christie in whom was given 21 years, names such an atmosphere "comfortless", and Stefani Cherill of 19 years new, president of an Association of the conservatives of the Oxford university, say that an attitude of the members of the student club to the carriers of right-centrist glances, have significantly degenerated.
"It is threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, and just the normal life of the members of the club" -, she speaks.
I was the first several weeks in Oxford not just in minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986 by the timid and shy of eighteen girl.
Oxford had fever from hate for the conservative party.
In a year before it the university by the voting deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree because of reduction of the budget allotments for higher education.
In such an atmosphere it would be comfortless even the Stalinists.
In the first days of freshman week when the students get acquainted with each other and the teachers I for the first time felt that had expected me ahead.
I haven't known that the teachers not only saw through the fingers baiting of students-conservatives, but with pleasure took in it part oneself yet.
The political questions are the miners' strike, the privatization and the disagreement between the government to use sanctions against the government of apartheid penetrated the Republic - of South Africa through the walls of the audiences, covered with the wooden panels.
On my first seminar it was for me necessary to translate a French text of the eighteenth century into the English, and I was not ready for the fact that have followed it.
"Miss Uajett -, teacher the now late Harry Pitt - has said, please, translate the first paragraph".
The text yielded me with difficulty, I stumbled.
Harry Pitt was a very bilious person with the face, similar to a cake.
"Doesn't Tetcheristy fundamentally teach to the French, or aren't - there enough for them just the brains" has he asked.?
Other students have chuckled.
With me the tears on the eyes have appeared.
"I advise on you to take several initial lessons on the French in the free time if you, of course, aren't occupied revolving in a society - Pitt has grumbled very much".
I have returned to my room of perfectly miserable.
In that evening in a college I sat behind lunch alone; then somebody patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, the student of the second course from a faculty of the English language which has seemed as a member of an Association of the conservatives of the university.
"I know who are you - he has said friendly.
-Regretfully the affair is in a following way:
Over each who is suspected of sympathies to the conservatives, will mock.
It is for me myself uneasy, and in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, therefore you will find it more complicated.
The majority of the freshmen-conservatives pretend that they are the labourists".
Later, in a local pub I cowardly tried to dissemble.
I insisted on the fact that agree not on everything that Margaret Thatcher speaks.
The cunning hasn't proved possible.
The freshman of the faculty of philosophy, policy and economy which studied itself in Eton has said: "You are the fascist pig's daughter.
You are contagious".
Other students have caught up his words.
I was perverse, dirty.
"How do the conservatives make love - has one of them Asked.?
-Do they pound each other true"?
I felt so, as, must be, the homosexuals before cancellation of criminal prosecution in the sixties felt.
Shall I be able ever to live normal life in Oxford?
Or shall I have to meet the like-minded persons only under the cover of the night?
Shall I be forced to conceal physique lejboristkoj and my real convictions?
The forthcoming me three years have begun to seem hell, full of persecutions and solitude.
Norman, the stone, the professor of modern history were the sole teacher in my college that wasn't concealing their conservative views.
He was hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but for the fact that he was adviser Thatcher on the questions of foreign policy and one of her speechwriters.
He practically didn't appear in a college.
He despised him provincialism, meanness and adherence to Marxist-deterministic glance at history.
In 1997 he received professorial job at the university Bilkent in Ankara Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy" -, he has told me.
I have begun to ride to Oxford from a parental house in London trying to find refuge among the kinsmen and the open-minded metropolitan friends.
I have told the father that I hate Oxford and have explained a cause.
He me didn't come to believe.
During its learning in the forties any political views there were received.
"But for it is the best university in the world -, he has said pitifully.
-There not capable of such only not in the city of the napping spires…
Even my friends-communists always behaved irreproachably".
His humid eyes have grown turbid.
"Don't make the wrong decisions.
I am sure that it is just the jokes.
You will break me the heart if you throw the university".
I was tired out by the constants for the journeys to London and washing emotional protection weakened.
My friend, also the conservative, haven't withstood pressure and have given up their convictions.
In the next week during the seminar, when the next teacher of history perfectly seriously named me "the enemy of a people" I decided to act as.
In a shower burning shame I have confessed that "the parents have washed for me the brains", have also named them "the old fools".
The respite was short.
Into a lid of the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to nail up the last nail for my father.
In that time he wrote each week in two columns for editions, belonging to *Rupert* Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and after five minutes my persecutors have given in.
When they went away I have packed a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I after all haven't returned.
You can name me the cry-baby and a rag.
But into eighteen years nobody must become an object of such a fury and intimidations in the training institution.
It is in that sadder that it was Oxford which has not only let out the Tory's, fourteen prime ministers but till this day hides behind an undeserved reputation of the university in which the equality and free thinking are appreciated.

"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the exhibition "Valentino: of expert-sewing" which opened in this week, in London, ABC talks with Nati Abaskal' with the famous for Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa and other clients of the Italian designer
*Somerset*-khaus, the former residence of English queen Elizabeth I the sole place is in the British capital, worthy to receive exhibition oh of Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the discovery "of Valentino: the expert on sewing", the triumphal retrospective exhibition which combines more than 130 dresses of the high fashion, created "by its house" over a distance of the last 50 years.
"I adore this palace" -, he says my unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of history she the sole character to which - "or a signora" of Garavani however is couldn't be written without his eminent clients.
Valentino always felt like charmed with rare and far by the world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened before 3 March, the personal letters and the photographs behind the noblest aristocrats' signature abound, from a princess *aga_khan* before a lord snow don, of including Mari-Shantal', the princess of Greece, and Margaret, the princess of Great Britain is Greased.
Valentino shows these personal recollections as booties of the social rise: from a modest tailor from the city of Vogera in the north of Italy before an idol "of the international elite".
To be enamored with a royal yard - nothing bad is in it.
"They at least don't keep down the butts of their cigarettes on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful stars of pop-music - make it", baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa speaks.
In the 60th also 70th years we both lived in Alps and was the good friends.
Valentino - the inimitable master also entertains the guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all liked to come into his chalet into Gshtaade - the former wife "of Khajni" Tissen, the close friend of the forgotten beauties like Marelly An'elli or Eugene Niarkhos explain very much".
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And notwithstanding it, he is a star.
Valentino, Valeria Matstsa, is presenting
The Argentinian model of Valery Matstsa recollects a charismatic designer.
Once we went to have dinner to it home many years ago, it was after a show of the fashions of the squares of Spain in Rome.
There were a Sheron stone and John Kennedy - junior among twenty invited.
Valentino style was manifested in everything - in each detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
"Valentino allowed each of the guests to feel important and liked" -, "a top model" recollects, the work of which on a designer has begun in 1995 during a Week of high fashion in Paris.
"He never goes out of a fashion, because his sketches are the present works of art" - she finishes.
A parade of pedigrees
Garavani life is the history not oderzhimostej, and of amorousnesses with full reciprocity.
He loves the people with good upbringing and the high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries *Somerset*-khaus was converted into the slick podium of sixty metres into length which proposes replacement of the roles: the visitor occupies a place of the models and has to defile over a podium contemplating "the spectators" from the dreams which glare at masterpieces from Valentino such as the dress which Zhaklin Kennedy for their wedding with Aristotle Onassisom, the suit which Monica Vitti in "the Nights", or the overcoat from the wool and the skin which belonged to an empress Diba Headlight used has chosen.
There are such names as Sibilla Luxemburgian in this public from the models blestayut Gloriya background Turn und Taxis Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario, from Bulgaria or, Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abaskal' and a designer in 2006
Many of these clients say, "is which the first Valentino - as the first love impossible to forget".
I remember him beautifully.
It was the trousers, the shirt, autumn-winter of 1971-1972 "is the waistcoat" and is a jacket from collection.
"It was the gift which he has given - for me", Nati Abaskal' speaks, one of the designer's Muses.
"I prefer him to the remaining for its femininity, behind his big love for the women, because he emphasizes our beauty" -, the former duchess de Feria adds.
Me please the colours which it uses: there is much light in them also they "approach" his face very much.
Proportions are ideal.
The princess and lawmaker of the fashions Patritsia Dell Dzhovampaola d". Arenberg too cannot forget the first time, when dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy I dreamt that I would have the age and a cause to put on one of its evening toilets…
Finally that hour came at the end of the 90th years.
I have bought my first dress from Valentino to put him on holiday in a castle of my cousin prince Edward de Line.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with the flounces, "the corsage" to a crease and a notch without the straps.
"It was sleep that has become reality" -, the widow Rodrigo d. of Arenberga speaks".
"Valentino is indifferent to a fashion, his passion is timeless", - this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires explains.
The princess d". Arenberg stores her holiday dresses in the designer with "the maximum caution… of the, because recollections accompanying the dress - not just this this dress, also the set it".
"The king" of a fashion
The great final of exhibition in *Somerset*-khaus is the wedding dress of Mari-Shantal' Miller for is her weddings from Pavel the sheat-fish from Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "girls" (as their seamstresses' designer names) have been required to make this costume of silk of colour of ivory bone with incrustation by pearl, twelve kinds of the different laces and a train into four and a half of metre.
According to journalist Syuzi Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press that dress is a landmark of a high fashion of the end of the XX century "return of the clients from the highest light".
Intoxicated many years "of the style of life" of the elite, now Valentino is her best representative himself.
A cavalier of the Large cross (the sign of distinction between the highest rank in Italy) the Holder of labour, the knight Commander of the order of Arts and literature, rewarded with an order of the Honorary legion Garavani, has assembled so many honours how much any of the his clients' spouses.
"His daintiness, his calm, his accurate and irreproachable external kind, - d. Arenberg recollects, always attracted my attention"".
The last time I saw him the month ago on ceremonial supper in Museum Orse.
He sat behind a table with countess Zhaklin de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, the time not exists for it".
If a princess it says…

The heaviest profession is in the world: the miners from Kavakh-Idzhena
For four euros the Indonesian miners risk life and health bringing in 70 kilograms of sulphur on apex of the volcano over the steep stony paths
There are people, for which their work is hell, and other literally work in hell.
Which among them Anto Vidzhajya earn one of the 400 miners for life with extraction of sulphur in volcano Kavakh-Idzhen, situated in the east of Indonesian island Java.
Each day Anto descends to a most bottom of the crater, where sulphureous gas, rising from the depths of the earth, congeals at contact with air.
Hackling the huge pieces of sulphur of which the common weight can equal 70 kilograms he puts them to two bamboo baskets, shoulders the baskets the shoulders and carries them upward along a precipitous stony road.
Before apex of the volcano the height of which equals 2.386 metres, only only 250 metres, by the emaciated heavers is however required more than 40 minutes to rise by tortoise step with difficulty retaining equilibrium and cautiously fumbling with a road not to misstep and not fall from breakage.
They know that one wrong step can cost them life as it has happened to one tourist from France which fell from rocks Kavakh-Idzhena several years ago.
The miners from Kavakh-Idzhena earn 5 Euro cents for each kilogram of sulphur which is obtained
Turning out at the top they lay themselves a road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were the monkeys from a circus, and, wearily carrying the heavy baskets, three kilometres to the weights, which the mineral resource company has aligned slightly higher, at the height of 1.850 metres march.
The speech suits about PT Kandi Ngrimbi the enterprise which exploits the Indonesian rupees are approximately like 1960 not to also say, this volcano the year is and better its employees to whom it pays 662 (5 Euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells him for 10.000 rupees (83 Euro cents), however this mineral to petrochemical productions, is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of the matches, fireworks, *COSMETICS*, dynamite and even for bleaching of sugar.
"For norm is portage of 70 kilograms we earn about 46.000 rupees (3,8 euros) behind each *KHODKA*" -, explain to us Anto, which usually executes three daily portages.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels like broken, however they allow him to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of day.
Although it seems *MIZER* for such a superhuman effort it is three times larger than the fact that it would earn in a floor.
"Char pay to the miners is very high by the local measures where 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros) in a day are paid for collection of coffee, and the the average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)" -, a heaver explains, which earlier worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There its salary reached 75.000 rupees (6,2 euros) in a day, and the area wasn't so heavy, but Anto has returned with its family in Ban'yuvangi, the small town is not far from a volcano, for the weighty cause which in Indonesia is the the same crushing as sulphur: "YA married a girl with Bali where the Hinduists alone are and have brought her to Java, so that it receives Islam".
At Anto asthma, he breathes with difficulty, permanently coughs, and with it the eyes tear because of toxic gas
Into the 27 years Anto has spent three years risking himself into Kavakh-Idzhene whose sulphur has already begun to tell on it notwithstanding the presence of the mask and the special spectacles.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, permanently coughs, and with it the eyes tear because of the toxic gas which a volcano secretes.
It is the price which it must pay for achievement of its dream.
"I shall work two more years, because I want to open a shop or study the Spanish or is French" -, he promises on more than acceptable, English.
The pleasant and clever young man, punished with life, this, would be able to be the tourist guide, the waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead of it he does the mule's work.
Dividing a dirty wooden hut into other porters he rises each day per two hours of night, because sulphur doesn't stop leaking out over the nights, when its characteristic yellow colour converts into blue and shines among gloom.

About 400 porters drag the baskets with sulphur on the shoulders from a bottom of the volcano
Notwithstanding high profits the mineral resource company didn't mechanize extraction of sulphur for economy of expenditures and don't grant any equipment to the porters who work on its bill and with such deprivations.
In fact they don't receive even the part from 30.000 rupees (2,5 euros) of the collection for photography which together with the input ticket is for 15.000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of this reserve collect from the tourists who come to photograph a volcano and his people-mules.

I shan't go away on pension, I shall die here, because the volcano is whole my life
Although sulphur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense posts of smoke, going out from a volcano, they are so strong that not one doesn't complain about their severe diseases…, the obviously, habitual problems, more serious than them, of breath, arthrosis, pains are in the knees and ulcers are on the shoulders which deformed under the weight of the baskets.

Each day he and his companions take out 15 tons of sulphur from a volcano which transport three lorries to a magazine into Tamansari overcoming the distance of 18 kilometres over a narrow path among the thickets.

Singapore looks for the children to salvage economy
The Singaporeans accuse career, stress and the prices of a dwelling and formation in the children's absence.
"It is for the population of Singapore necessary to grow".
I the husband the patriot, you are my spouse, the patriot, executable, our civil debt also shall create life!
It can seem incredible that these lines are the part of advertisement of the mint flat cakes however, notwithstanding it - or perhaps due to it -, by video it has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These sentences are the part of the rap which uses the local sayings it seems "Let put bao (the bun) to an oven" to laugh at the level of birthrate in Singapore.
The advertising agency which has made this video, BBH cherishes hope that with the help of advertisement they will succeed in attracting attention to a given problem in a recreational form.
Him creative director Douglas Hamilton, what say, wanted to use the force of music, so that the people perform "their national duty".
This thing is only for the Internet, it therefore was for us necessary to make her cheerful and funny.
It is the main problem in a country.
We are the worst in the world of in reproduction similar to ourselves, we have therefore felt that it is that theme which we must affect.
We knew that the government had tried to make much, for example, realize a launching of the spirits with the pheromones or organize the parties of quick acquaintances (the blitz-rendezvous).
Many of these ideas perhaps were creative, but have unobligingly worked.
Shouldn't we, have therefore we thought, why *would* make most creative thing from possible, to solve a given problem, namely compose rap?
1,2 children
Who not perceives it so thoughtlessly is a government of Singapore.
It spends 1.300 US dollars in a year on policy for inspiration of the citizens on birth of the *greater* number of children.
The state package for married couples and the parents grants up to 15.000 dollars for a child, extends leaves over pregnancy and also provides the kinds with tax benefits.
But all of it has low effectiveness.
Singapore is, also the rich and high technology state-city in the South-eastern Asia famous for conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The level of birthrate in Singapore, according to its national administration of the population is at the level of 1,2 children on a woman currently.
The last time he was below 2 - what is known as percent of replacement - in 1976.
Why so haven't the Singaporeans the *greater* number of children?
*Tana* Twist Ming, the director of the Section on policy from married couples and the families of the National administration of the population "formation, say that a cause of that, improved", and "a wider gamma of the career possibilities".
"It has allowed the people to have a wider scale of the versions in the fact that touch vital aims and priorities besides wedding and creation of a family -, she explains, at one's disposal".
These changes of social norms contribute to growth of the number of bachelors and storage of marriages and the children's, birth, as a result of which, the level of birthrate in Singapore has gone down.
In the meantime the immigrational policy which is directed on a considerable increase of immigration for confrontation with reduction of the population causes perturbation among the local population.
There in Singapore are websites where the hardly concealed xenophobia with respect to many new immigrants, especially the Chinese who are criticized for maintenance of salaries at the low level and unwillingness to be integrated prospers.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the causes of the fact that in the last year the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result in an election since times of independence.
There was attempt to solve a problem, with the help of quotes and more than high taxes for the foreign workers after the election.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall of birthrate has known influence on the economic height of the nation, tax-entering, of expenses for medicine and policy of immigration the example of Singapore also begins to have some unexpected consequences.
The government makes the efforts, so that so much small dwelling doesn't fall in.
For example this beginning to influence a sector of a real estate.
The manual of urban development has passed to the control of the number of the small apartments, known as "the footwear box", is to which possible build in the definite districts of the city.
These apartments of the area of 46 square metres very well sell themselves.
There nevertheless is opinion that they can contribute to an idle lifestyle and deprive the developers who want to build the large family dwelling of a stimulus.
But Lima YU. Put, general director of the house building, the companies EL Developers, says that their "footwear boxes" much quicker than the more spacious specimens sell themselves.
They are more popular in that sense, which such apartments will be snapped up several days even weeks quicker than an apartment of *greater* size.
As its result, our money-entering increases.
Nevertheless he recognizes that new norms give the clearer orientators for the developers in whom earlier obstacles placed if they wanted to propose too many small apartments in the project.
Too overstrained
Singapore is the city-state.
Although these new rules can be step in a direction of an increase of national birthrate, after a talk with the Singaporeans who work in the financial quarter of the center it seems that they won't have special effect.
"The people are overstrained very much, the dwelling is expensive also as also the formation, and because of it many people put - it aside", a young manager speaks.
Other people can have the children.
"But it is important for me to have the own money and the time - at one's disposal", the other young man of 20 years speaks.
The men and the women mention their career, stress and the prices of a dwelling and formation as the causes which hamper them in acquiring the children.
So however the government tried to impel its citizens to the children's birth in what concerns childbearing the last word remains to get the Singaporeans.

Personal in the off-line mode - personal in the on-line mode
Confidentiality.
According to a dictionary of the Royal academy of the Spanish language the matter concerns about the property of quotient or "a sphere of the personal life which have right to protect against any intervention".
What is personal for a minor more junior than 16 years?
How does he use this definition in his everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which is subjected in discussion on the Internet of the situations which by all means wouldn't share beyond the Internet?
elPeriodico have given an interview to five children from ten to 15 years, the frequent users of network.
In four cases they associated a term "with something very "by my" for a personal plane, both password and the user's, name" when was used he to social networks.
"I wouldn't load my biggest secrets during fasting" -, speak, Khorkhe, is when try to explain the value of personal on such sites as Facebook, twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where he has the registration recordings the ten-year already two years.
"It is the very secret secrets, my mom can know them but are not the whole world" -, he asserts.
FB I load the beautiful pictures or the pictures from the games on.
Also I disport myself with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share the photograph which is not my, or of anybody who behaves foolishly" -, he speaks.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish the indecent photographs of the naked people of crimes or write insulting or furious comments.
Khorkhe assures that 35 friends, nine know, which he has in FB, and the folloverov in twitter.
Their majority are the kinsmen.
Mother in course she has a password to one of the registration recordings.
I have acquired twitter to express myself and write interesting tvity.
"I don't know, one corresponds to me, I load - only them", he adds.
"Social networks are entertainment, I can speak with the distant kinsmen or their quick - friends", he indicates.
Not conceiving answer that have never will accepted a query of the unfamiliar face.
Wouldn't *WOULD* reckon with anybody who would recommend him to a stranger.
The case of 14 year-old Jose differs.
This teenager has the open registration recordings on Hotmail of Facebook My Space and Ask, and in the last recognize that 20 people, added into the friends' his list, don't know.
"It doesn't frighten me, because we have anything common, music, for example" -, he indicates.
According to the words of the boy nobody to it shuffled in confidence and didn't ask his domestic address or the number of telephone.
"I if I come to be pressed or require just shall remove them from my registration recording" -, he recognizes.
Jose has become follower Ask after reading of recommendation to twitter.
Experiment in the fact that how today is known to kibermobbing is not alien to a boy.
My friend's one acquaintance was blackmailed on social network.
One threatened to him and extorted money.
"He after all hasn't found out who really was" - he assures.
The victim according to the words of Jose hasn't removed the registration recording.
"Have only included confidentiality".
Then he explains the sequence of steps in a way, safe for tuning of the registration recording.
Unlike Khorkhe this boy would load the photographs of the acquaintances in the uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes I would make it if the person doesn't please me or if I want it.
"Although I know that I am it kibermobbing" -, he confirms.
The key questions
Mar'elos Porras the teacher of the English and a specialist in formation and an instruction, believe that to direct the children and the teenagers, it is necessary to understand that aim of social networks - inform.
"The Internet has appeared as means for search for information, but with appearance of these sites the rules of a game, - have varied", she notes.
The, Porras specifies that academician Marc Prenski, the expert on pedagogy from the Yale university and the author of labour Digital natives and the immigrants, has invented these terms for explanation of a given phenomenon.
The digital natives it them, the children and the youth who were born in an epoch of technologies.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach to them, while we else study - ourselves", she speaks.
Explain that this theme is complicated, "because we ask them to have definite criterion for the fact that it is possible or one may not spread, publish or say at age, when there isn't enough maturity it".
"Also that they were selective, while it is the most important of all for them to be popular, have thousands of friends not thinking about consequences" -, she adds.
According to the words of the specialist to speculate their the most effective mode which make such show that confidentiality the children and the teenagers, - to ask the questions is.
"To tell them that they didn't make it is useless" -, she adds.
Does Porras then list any versions: are there things which you wouldn't tell the stranger, why do you so make it on the Internet?
Or, would you like if photography had been published you like one that have published you about your friend?
Do you know that other publish about you?
When do you sign the photographs from the parties, do you ask for permission from other people to mark them?
And to one, more know, is for all necessary, what do you do at each moment?
One more point - it allow them understand that they must behave the on-line mode as as is made, it is the off-line mode.
The rules are alone and are the same.
"Beyond the Internet the person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, as has to be on social networks" -, she asserts.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardiya the university the teacher, the professor of the initial education and a counselor over formation, the necessity of the fact that the heads of the families conscientiously read explains, of policy of social networks.
Understanding each of the points they have good reasons of the talks with the children about the prerequisites of opening of the registration recording on the Internet.
"For example, age and the fact that it is permitted to spread or publish" -, he speaks.
Gaurdiya agrees, "don't say the key question - to remind the children of a lesson with the strangers".

Confirmation by both presidents of the fact that they will be subordinated to the International court happened in this week of Bogotskij immediately after Columbia has contested the pact according to which it recognized subordination to the verdicts of this international court after a decision on the sea borders with Nicaragua which she has believed erroneous.
The summit has taken place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil Dilmy Rusef; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Moralesa; also Argentina, Christine Kirshner.

"The south America must study at Europe in a question of integration of citizenship": Raphael Korrea
President of Ecuador Raphael Korrea confirmed today that creation of common citizenship was the aim at which "the South America in this case yes must study at Europe".
Korrea which participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of the south American nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, has declared state television of Peru that the Europeans "killed each other during the Second world war", and in other collisions, "they are however now practically one fatherland".
He protected in this context the project of an establishment of the south American citizenship of which the countries-participants UNASUR approve.
"It is necessary to attain free movement of the citizens and working over any south American country, how it already happens to the members of the Andes community, but there hitherto are reactionary sectors which want to return us to the past" - he has warned.
The Ecuadorian president has revealed himself besides that by the partisan of a resumption of an Organization of the American states (*OAS*) under a prerequisite of decrease in influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and acceptance into attention of ones who have signed a Pact of San Jose of human rights.
Ones who give talks never take on no obligations on themselves, and we, the south Americans, conversely, sign everything.
"Inexplicably what inter-American the commission for human rights will walk enough in Washington also is financed by the United States" -, he has declared hinting at political refuge, given by Ecuador to founder WikiLeaks Julian Assange.
Korrea has assured that don't regret this solution, because with it he didn't betray the principles, but observed the "deep values of democracy and human rights".
He has added that "there were definite suspicions of the fact that Assange will be extradited to the third country, and a process won't be observed" in his time.
He has criticized besides that, the Swedish justice is for a requirement to come to its territory for interrogation concerning supposed crime while there is "the Swedish legislation itself on the sexual soil, believe possible to realize him by, to make with the embassy of Ecuador in London was of which is for the video conference possible".
Korrea has confirmed that risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange exists.
"Me not said from by him since he has come to our embassy, but, the ambassador has reported to me that at him, a small pulmonary problem, the Ecuadorian head of the state has said, was, nothing serious" -.
What indeed is is danger of deterioration of its physical and mental health because of incarceration in small space without a possibility to do exercises on air.
"It influences any person's - health", he has added.
Korrea has specified that a solution of the problem of refuge, granted to Assange from June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by allocation of a guarantee of the inviolability which will allow him to go to Ecuador, are in the arms of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs and have emphasized that negotiations in London on search for a solution of the problem of incarceration of the founder WikiLeaks were.
We don't conduct negotiations on human rights, we don't use this word for a given case, but permanent discussions were.
"The solution of this problem is found in the arms of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial organs, because the lawyer of Assange, Bal'tasar *GARSON* leads a series of the processes in the different European instances" - he has mentioned.
And have expressed opinion that "if Great Britain tomorrow gives a guarantee of inviolability it will end".
Also if how Sweden her beautifully allows her legislation, and how she has already made in other cases, will interrogate seigneur Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or will interrogate him Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Korrea has used a case to reveal oneself as a defender of print freedom and has emphasized that don't tolerate "a mediocrity, the unconscientiousness and lie which distorts freedom of expression".
"The main enemies of print freedom, he has said it is not the perverse villains-politicians, but are the bad journalists, supporting profit, blackmail and extortion" -.
He has remained glad that more narrowly neither these journalists "nor are the bankers, nor the bourgeois countries-hegemons don't reign in Ecuador" from this aspect and has added that being reelected "will deepen a revolution for continuation of development in a true direction".
Korrea has also supported a decision to keep veto of Paraguay into UNASUR at least before the next election substantiating it with the fact that an organization "have to be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a support of upheavals under a mask of legality", because in reality "it has destroyed legality of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president has believed besides that "perfectly reasonable" a wish of his Columbian colleague of Juan Manuel Santosa to conduct negotiations with Nicaragua on the sea borders between two countries after the solution of the International court of justice of the Hague which has turned out in favour to Nicaraguan sea sovereignty now.
For a given moment this solution isn't observed.
It is a problem between the south American and the central American countries.
The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome by the wish to walk together.
It is necessary to process them together to overcome them and continue to move ahead.
Also he has voiced hope for good termination of the argument on the sea boundaries which is held in the same court of Peru and Chile, and has voiced, which "is correct for the Latin America to appeal to the international instances if two countries pledge to make a decision however heavy it was".
Concerning a possibility to act as as a candidate in the forthcoming presidential election in Ecuador to run on the third term in succession, he has indicated that he considers this possibility "with large optimism and joy, although occasionally it is enough heavy".
Korrea has assured that if lose in an election in February 2013 then will give public life.
In a personal plan I have been never interested in the power, but in such unfair situations as in Ecuador, social-economic poverty can be corrected only on the part of the political power.
"My political movement has believed that just I guaranteed this probable victory, so that one has to recognize this responsibility" -, he has said.
In a case of a victory it would become my last term in the president's job, and then we go out from public life.
If the same loses.
He has confirmed "this solution" -.
Korrea has also mentioned new course for treatment of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I have just said with Venezuelan vice-president Nicholas Maduro, which have told me that he departed on the routine treatment which has already been planned, and that it is expected that it will pass a campaign to return to Cuba.
"It doesn't mean aggravation of state of the health of president Chavez" -, he has explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI summit of the heads of the states and the governments of the Union of the south American nations (UNASUR) which has finished with appeals for *greater* regional integration for maintenance of progress, equality and security.

The mortality from AIDS today - the result of late diagnostic
Fabritsio was 21 years, when it was announced that its analysis on AIDS had given positive result to it.
"I like have been deafened" -, he recollects, one is difficult notwithstanding the doctor's whole tact, the moment.
The young boy has concealed it from its family.
Deciding to cope with a disease independently he has wanted to find out her how possible more And his efforts has come - true he has already observed his 43th birthday.
Fabritsio - one of the "oldest" patients of HIV-separation of hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG) where he has got in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He lived with a diagnosis "virus of immunodeficiency of the person" (HIV) already 22 years are At the beginning of the 90th years into it would be complicated come - to believe too few then existed versions of treatment, too few things were known of a disease, too in a bias treated the patients.
Even the so director of a clinic of the Mexican institute of social protection hasn't wanted to say goodbye to it, "because he had a cut".
In other words in those times to have AIDS was a verdict.
It now is possible to survive at this syndrome and make it not aggravating the quality of life.
Nevertheless not knowing of their disease hitherto many people come, when the virus has already caused damage, "has exhausted" their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
"The fact that the survival of the patient who begins treatment in time, and the survival of the common population in precision are similar -, the head of the HIV section HCG Khajme Andrade Vil'yanueva has indicated refering to the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in prestigious scientific edition, with 31 years after appearance of AIDS in the world, at least after the first declared cases is great achievement for a given moment".
The infection disease doctor and an expert on HIV an AIDS, Andrade Vil'yanueva has explained that since 2008 the scientists have come, to a conclusion that AIDS isn't a verdict, however the duration and the quality of life depend on the degree of defeat of the immune system, available at the patients, at the beginning of diagnostic, with the best expected duration of life with ones who don't use the drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD4, and before 50 summers when is reported about 500 CD4.
More simply speaking, aforesaid mean, which the the one who receives a diagnosis HIV-of positive is at age is 25 years old according to these terms "supporting the control will be able to live without the problems up to 75 years" -, he has explained.
To estimate this progress it is necessary to recollect that the duration of the Mexicans' life today on the average are 76 years.
Although mortality significantly went down in the last years in a case of Mexico the number of people, dying from AIDS, went down from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in the year 2011 (the yearly report YUNEJDS), also the fact that from a moment of appearance of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in a national database have died is also true.
Only in Khalisko 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths to May of this year; already are registered, nevertheless, is established, which is universal access to antiretrovirusnym preparations since 2005.
-Why hitherto are there lethal outcomes?
-It seems that a problem not in access to treatment personally to me.
So I imagine it, the affairs in our hospital are so.
We hadn't the at least last 12 years a shortage in the medicaments, the problem is in the fact that the patients come very late, because isn't known of our infected state i.e. at the late stages of a disease.
He has given crushing data: "Nine of the ten patients come, when have some opportunistic infection; already, which is necessary on to conduct diagnostic to grant is for to have *greater* influence mortality, to to make, common so is it are the tests detection is in the mass scale, for all people, who will ask it, more than early stages, and therefore necessary".
In their offer converge to opinion the specialists and the officials of the State council for prevention of AIDS into Khalisko (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, by only the like Fabritsio which has appealed to the private laboratory for a checkup impelled fact that it has made his friend, and, notwithstanding its young age, it has already been at the stage of AIDS, also even suffered from sarcoma Kaposhi, the cancerous tumor which is one of the widespread complications.
Everything changes, when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that will die, and don't want to know anything.
"I, the time all the same shall die, I shall load up better three times per week" - say they But we not in wash a case.
There are positive changes, I well feed, I do exercises, I receive the medications.
For today, his parents only know, that he has transfered of the feretories.
I live normal life as any is other.
"I work in me hard studies, I journey, I lead active sexual life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care about myself and the other person", - Fabritsio, has listed which has agreed share by my personal life from MILENIO JALISCO that spodvignut' my declaration of ones who now, in a context of World day of struggle with AIDS feel fear.
Let ????? be tested if risk was, with infections, although is how possible rather found, out whether they are HIV-positive, so feels better, and if they have a diagnosis, although it is found out that can live as any other person being responsible already.
Its this message summarizes a theme of struggle against AIDS in this year 2012.
The condoms are behind a counter
The precipices between the programmes in the domain of health protection and a simple citizen, the, Ricardo Salazar, believes, journalist from Guadalajara who has started to deal with a problem, connected with HIV, are large.
And it is the largest prevention.
In the places, dedicated to this task, "the dissemination of the condoms in fact increased, earlier to us gave, one or two, now us allow the packages over hundred, and it is very good, but it turns out that to eat ones who now hitherto haven't access to a condom" -, he has said.
The teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Do you need them what for" popular the question, with jeering and condemnation, on the part of the social employees, the school counselors, the employees of the drugstores and the employees of health protection which not the teenagers want to hear have certified is the propagandist it.?
I propose to change this ineffective distribution; that the condoms were not only behind the counters and that their hundred was in the automata in the public toilets in the places which often the youth attends.
It is not the encouragement of profligacy.
The matter doesn't concern about payment for beer and a motel, governor Emilio Gonzalez, has answered whether when it was asked distribution of the condoms with its leadership is possible.
"It is not the sexuality, it is the best of all to make the condoms accessible to ones who practise sexual activity -, he has noted, already".
Key data are in Khalisko
The 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV) are registered.
The state occupies the 4th place in national rating on the new and total occasions of AIDS and the 13th over HIV.
92 % of infections relate to a sexual way, 6 % across the blood and 2 % to a perinatal way.
By estimations, 50 thousand people can live from HIV, for for one registered case from 4 to 5 people which don't know of it are.

Taking ratification by the appellate court of the United States of a solution into account which annuls restructurization of debt of the Group of Vitro, reached by competitive production in Mexico, the script sets fatal precedent for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country which has the problems of solvency.
It seems that the procedures in a support of survival of the companies which are permitted by Mexican laws aren't actual in a country of the bands and the stars, in contradiction with the international agreements.
In a practical sphere approval of a decision, made on 15 June by judge Kharlin Hale in a court of bankruptcies of the northern district of Texas, leaves defenseless the Mexican companies in front of a possibility of an imposition of an arrest on their property on that side of Rio Grande.
However the decree opens the doors for the leading producer of a glass in Mexico for appeal to the Supreme court of the United States leading three mismatches into a proof.
As entry, while the judge of an affair notes that the creditors must be adjusted by the Code of the USA about bankruptcy the Appellate court of the fifth district, situated in the New Orleans, says that the basic trial concerns competitive production, considered in Mexico.
The first point means cancellation of international judicial cooperation in the cases of insolvency of the enterprises of transnational profile.
In fact Type law of the UN over a unification of right of international trade with this aim was created defining as a referee the American institute of right.
Secondly the verdict establishes that without an intercompany voting, restructurizations the indebtednesses, recognized in the critical mass of competitive production, which had in front of a maternal company branches Vitro, majority, necessary for assertion, weren't reached are.
Mexican laws nevertheless recognize this possibility.
In fact Vitro wasn't the first case, when this scheme is received.
Half a dozen of examples is among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana whose intercompany debts the Federal institute of competitive productions guaranteed.
It is true, also also the fact that subtracting the voices of branches, it is anyway is the creditors Vitro who struggled against him in the courts of the United States namely the funds "the vultures" like Aurelios Capital Aurelios Convergencia Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, wouldn't reach majority.
The voting would be 45 percent against 37.
The Appellate court omits these data.
On the other hand he accuses Vitro in the complicated situation with which the one has collided beginning since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis which has overtaken the United States delivering the blows at a country.
As long as what the company of the family Gonzalez of the Garden shows, the appeal against a solution into is the appellate court, itself that the voting has reached his plenum, i.e., five judges in view of the fact that only three have been voted.
In a case of a failure the intercession for the certificate which will require revision of a process on the part of the court of the supreme instance, in a given case of the Supreme court of the United States will be shown.
Worst of all the fact that the court has rejected a document, directed by the government of Mexico in a role amicus curiae ("the friend of a court") in which the process which should Vitro within the framework of Law of competitive productions, signaling the fact that he releases itself from observance of the agreements, signed by both countries to connect with an article of Law 15 of the USA of bankruptcy, is described, she.
It besides that is noted that the country has been subordinated to the principles of the Commission of the Organization of the Combined Nations for international trade, i.e., the rules, introduced for the cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for the debtors and the creditors.
Carom from two boards: they beat at Vitro and beat at a country.

Hector "of Khetin" Rejes: "the Basketball was my life"
Inveterate basketball traveller Hector "of Khetin" Rejes was more than 60 years connected with this sport and, due to it, has maneged the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico bear so many basketball stories, as Hector "of Khetin" Rejes in the memory.
And however before than the haemorrhage from the brain has enchained him to an invalid carriage in 2008, Rejes was immersed into sport during more than 60 years, as a player small categories, the player the Supreme basketball league, the representative and the leader BSN and Cowboys Bayamona and the president of a Federation of basketball.
"I executed many roles in basketball over a distance of my life, including somewhat simultaneously how when I was president BSN, the general director of the National team and the president of a federation in the 90th years" -, Rejes during a visit of Primera Hora to him recollects home where in Bayamon he lives in my faithful spouse from Isabel', over a distance more of 50 years.
"The basketball was my life".
Rejes doesn't exaggerate making this assertion.
Walls of its house almost all, decorated with the photographs and the memorable things, gathered behind its long way, testify to it.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions he stores that which remember his way across the Cowboys beginning with the middle of the 50th years as a player before the year, 1982 when accomplished 15 years of his departure into the roles from-an agent or an agent of a contract.
"It was my best years which I enjoyed most of all, because had a possibility to be the part of the eight championships of the Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, from-an agent or a leader.
Five championships that have passed approximately 1971 were many years of joy, including till 1975.
And afterwards I said goodbye to one in the year, 1981 per year of debut of Jerome Minsi into BSN.
From that moment also henceforth to lead has begun "Kuko" Ortis, which was the great manager" -, Rejes has specified.
I remember that Ginas *Bart* which started here and was, at the university of Alabama (Birmingham), have told me: "I for you have a very strong player in growth 6' 7".
"Do you want"?
And it was Minsi beginning one of the best players whom Puerto Rico had.
Then recommended *Bart*, sniper Raymond Gaussa, who has received citizenship has also become one of our best bombardiers.
Me I remember that have said that if Minsi has brought championship Bayamonu has helped to conquer Gauss one more.
I have enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys and Gauss, but already at distance, because by 1988 have already appeared the head of a federation.
To that time I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements of Minsi in a national team.
I remember, as we have won for the first time from the USA during an olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then the world Championship of the year, 1990 on which we have received the fourth place and came, it had to be bronze if *would*, not that Canadian judge, who has made us outplay a final game, Rejes has said.
That command from the world Championship of 1990 is the best picked team which you have ever seen?
What she among best as also one has won from Dream Team on the Olympic games of 2004.
But one, was, which from the Pan-American games at Cuba in 1991 when we won, my favourite, gold has also broken the national team of the USA which was enough similar to one who has won bronze in world championship from us.
In that command Minsi not only again played Gauss, *Ramon* Rivasa Fiko Lopez and' Pikulina' (Ortisa), but, whom also young (Xavier)' Ton'ito' Colon and James Karter, brothers Leon (Fransisko and Edgar) and Mario' Kikhote' Morales couldn't participate in the year 90 because of injury of the knee.
The command which perhaps, was not the best in a plan of personal composition, but Argentina has brought us a golden medal and great joy, was a command of the Olympic qualifying tournament of the year 1995 in Neukene.
With the role players like' Kanito' N'evesa of Pablo Alisea also of young Rolando Khurruitnera instead of the players, temporarily pushed aside disorder of the Pan-American championship, *Mar_del_Plata*, we have won gold despite all forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Pikulin Ortis was without versatile doubts this.
Its indexes on the international tournaments impress.
Nobody dominated in Puerto Rico at this level so, as Pikulin made it.
And without a registration it is its careers in the different leagues in which it played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It is a very complicated question.
We had very good young, including *Julio* Toro, the Flora Melendesa Carlos Moralesa, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torresa.
The work of Leo Arilly from young pleases me very much.
What do you believe your main achievement in a federation?
Participation is in the most glorious epoch of national team between the 1988 and 1995 years, and what at the beginning of the 90th years in BSN was before 17 commands in season.
What has had you to make?
The things which I wanted to realize were, for example *REGIONALIZATSIYa* of smaller categories.
For example that the boys from Ponse played only in their region and only against the commands from other parts of the island there is playoff in national.
Now the children journey and play too much, and it is excessive.
At least I see the fruits of obligatory certification and course for the managers, the officials and the judges.
It delivers pleasure to me.
What do you now do?
Most of all I listen to music, I see musical videos of my epoch on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and I go from time to time on the basketball matches.
And, I, of course, enjoy a society of my spouse Icabel' who always was with me.

Larry Khegmen whose role of the oil tycoon-predator Dzhej the Are of Yuinga is in tele serial "Dallas" has become a symbol of greed in the 1980th years has died.
He was 81 years old.
Khegmen which returned in this year as J.R in new season "of Dallas", died on Friday of the evening because of the complications, called by the crayfish, according to a declaration of the family, granted for The of Associated Press by the company of Warner Bros, the studio of the production "of Dallas".
"Larry has again returned to his favourite native city of Dallas again playing the sign role which most of all pleased - him", a family has said him.
The family of Larry and the closest friends were with him in Dallas on a fair in honour of Thanksgiving Day.
Lind Grej having played the role of his spouse is in original serial and in a sequel, was next to Khegmenom, when he died in a hospital of Dallas, her representative Jeffrey Lejn has said.
He brought joy for everybody who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, tender and talented, and I shall miss him very much.
"He was an original personality and lived full life" -, Grej in a declaration has confirmed.
At Khegmena the cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and it has recognized that it drank during many years was diagnosed.
In 1995 the malignant tumor with him was detected in the liver, and it has transfered transplantation.
Khegmen has long before "Dallas" won fame on television due to a role of honest type in easy comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcasted by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In her he played captain Tony Nelson, the astronaut whose life changes, when he meets the attractive girl-jinni whom Barbara Iden, plays and begins to live under one roof with her.
Also he was the main character of two comedies which seldom appeared in broadcast "of The Good Life" (NBC 1971-72) also "of Here We Go Again" (ABC 1973).
His work included the roles, warmly received by the critics, "in The Group" "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors" into a movie.
But just his masterly interpretation of delightfully detestable J.R has brought Khegmena to apex of fame.
dramatic *SERIAL2* *CHANNEL1* CBS *CLAN* Yuingov and different/other *CHARACTER2*/*PERSONAGE* in *HE1* *SURROUNDINGS* *GO1*/*WALK1* in *BROADCAST1* from *APRIL* 1978 till *MAY2* 1991.
Is the slogan advertising "Who shot J.R into" conceived for creation of hoopla around episode, full of emotions, in which Khegmena character is almost killed, has generated international discussions and millions of the dollars which were risked in the bookie offices.?
Also it has helped to attract the record audience at that time to serial.
Answer in episode from November 1980, on the average 41 in millions of televiewers, when was given he was looked at and has converted "Dallas" into the second in the number of scannings recreational programme in history, after the final "MASH" in 1983 of having attracted 50 million spectators.
It was the sister-in-law J.R of Christines (in execution of Mary of Crosby), which shot him.
J.R have hampered her and then threatened to her that would accuse her of prostitution if it doesn't buzz off from the city, but other too had the reasons to attack him.
Khegmen has played Yuinga as an insatiable corruptionist with charismatic smile: the dishonest businessman and the unfaithful husband which wanted, so that its spouse alcoholic Sue Ellen (Lind Grej) is placed on treatment.
"I know that I must be on the sepulchral stove J.R" -, Khegmen in 1988 has said.
Have to be said: "honest citizen J.R Yuing rests Here".
It is the sole transaction which it has lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, too the heroine of original serial recollected on Friday Khegmena as somebody "huge, as on, and beyond the screen".
He is unforgettable and is irreplaceable for millions of admirers from the whole world, and in the hearts of each of us who have had luck know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new production "of Dallas" were shown several months ago with great success on channel TNT.
A recording of five episodes of the second season has already been finished, and the sixth was in production, a channel has reported.
Warner or TNT as long as a declaration of that hasn't been made, that will be with serial after Khegmena departure.
The native, Forth-Uerta, Texas, him was how who Mary Martin shone the son of an actress and a singer in such classical works "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was else a teenager, when bore him is in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Khegmenom.
He has tried happiness on the theatrical scenes of New York of the beginning of the 1950th years, and then the year served in the Air Force of England since 1952 over 1956.
Being there he has got acquainted with young Swedish woman artist May Aksel'sson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Khajdi, and they lived the long time in the Californian city of Malibu where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "of Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) of Tales about My Life".
"I haven't included anything there, which I would count in any way - capable of causing pain to somebody or influence them", he Prensa Asociada in that time has said.
After transplantation of the liver he has begun to advocate donorship of the organs and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to help the patients feeling fear.

The course which investigates "the End of light" begins
By each week the students investigate the apocalyptic phenomena, such as a nuclear war, the zombi, the viruses and the bacteria and globally warming.
In this semester, when professor of religion Stuart Sharme decided to read course about the end of light he knew that he had had irresistible bait: the end "of the long countdown" of a calendar by the Maya on 21 the December which many people as for a proof of the fact that the end of light will impend have caught at his disposal.
But Charm notion not had that had expected him into the nearest couple of months: catastrophic hurricane Sendi, the financial crisis, which some name "dolgoarmageddonom", and a growing conflict where Israel, the place Apocalypse will be drawn in where the Christian theorists of the end of times assume that will begin.
"I didn't realize that it would be most apocalyptic semester from everybody", - has said Charm in this week of the University to the students Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If analyze the fact that happen in the world currently, as if in us *HAVE* remained in all 30 days it was an indeed good period.
And you remember that is bad well for ones who have an apocalyptic image of ideas.
And he is not the sole professor who proposes courses on a theme "of the end of light" in this semester, theoretically last in history.
At the Templ'skom university the adjunct-professor Barry Vaker reads course "the mass Media, culture and the end of light".
By each week the students investigate the apocalyptic themes, such as a nuclear war, the zombi, the viruses and the bacteria, and globally warming.
"We analyze why these ideas with the time spread" -, he has said also a mode, to which the hypothetical scripts, the person's defiant definite acts are proposed.
If the nuclear material gets into the terrorists' arms the war, for example can break out.
In this month the students analyzed the films on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they corresponded to the examples from real life.
"I have tried to tell the students about the fact that it is possible, it probably, is verisimilar and it is impossible" -, Vaker has said.
There is professor of the history of the Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague of Amar Solari, the adjunct-professor of the history of art and anthropology in the main campus of the University of the state of Pennsylvania, has united to read the course which is called just "for the End of light".
"We don't add' 2012', that always to read course is to have the possibility the time more if the end of light doesn't begin" -, Restall has said.
Notwithstanding "imminent destruction" the students must be taught to prepare the projects and take the final examinations.
The final examination will be, begin on eve of Apocalypse which not leaves the students the other choice except to work "before that very night into which presumptively the end of light will begin", in Penn State, Restall has said.
Courses have turned out enough popular.
"The places have ended in two hours" -, Restall has said about their course for the students with the high middle grade, on which 35 students have enlisted.
We received the messages by an e-mail during many weeks in front of the beginning of semester from the people who asked whether there were else places.
The students in their turn assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to observe, which the people do to console themselves" -, Bridzhid Robinson, the 23 year-old student of the section on religion and sociology from Khaddonfilda of New Jersey, to Rutgers Camden has said.
And an apocalyptic image of idea, secular or religious, it is only a question of consolation or its absence.
Uill Vekesa, 25-summer the student of the section on psychology and the nurse affair have said that watched all apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of the course to which would teach it" -, he has noticed.
He pleases me.
But not one of the interrogated students - not speaking already a professor - has said that believe in the date of the end of light on 21 December.
"Our first project affected prophecy of a Maya, and in some kind we discredited - him" the, Dzhuli Zeglen has said, 21 year-old student of the last course at the Templ'skom university from Uest Chester.
The Mayas have never predicted the end of light; it is just the key moment in a calendar, Restall has said.
But he has noted that the apocalyptic anxiety in the western culture which counts several centuries, where the people react to changes around it predicting the end of light exists.
The Internet has caused an increase of these speculations.
"Elsewhere the people don't think about it" -, he has said.
Mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dogerti, the professor of religion of the university *LA6*-the sal which teaches courses is on Philippines in this year, have quickly answered with a question whether it knows of some course about "the end of light" there.
"Philippines don't take part at the end of light" -, he has written hinting at an order of the superior instance.
We have pardon from the Pope.
Restall have paid attention, which was spoken about many days of the last court, and have said that, if nothing happens over a distance of the long time on 21 December, "the people at once will begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that on 21 December is the beginning of the seven-year period upon expiration of which the world will end.
The students and the teachers carelessly treat to this date.
Some have said that is going to go on the parties "of the end of light".
"I, may be, shall call somebody from the friends to together laugh" -, Samira Ford, the 20 year-old student of the faculty of a connection has commented.
