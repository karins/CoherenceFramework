The Republican strategy of resistance to the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified its policy to fight the electoral fraud.
But in the centre Brennan the final myth, arguing that cases of fraud in elections in the United States more than the cases of death from stroke of lightning.
By the same lawyers for the Republicans were only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is for sure: this new trend will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American States was responsible for organizing the elections in the United States.
That is why most of the governments of the States with 2009 pass laws, complicating the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon new scope after the elections in November of 2010, which brought Republicans the 675 new seats in 26 states.
The result for 2011 alone was passed 180 bills restricting the right to vote in the 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo identification and proof of us citizenship.
Moreover, these laws reduce the period of early voting, eliminated right registration of voters in the day and will take away the right to vote with the citizens, have a criminal record.
2006 elections no us state is not obliged voters to present photo identification.
Indiana the first state, which has adopted such a requirement.
The us Supreme Court in 2008 upheld the constitutionality of the law, adopted in Indiana.
Republican power to extend this to other States.
In the last two years, they have laws requiring voters to present photo identification, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec American citizens do not have universal proof of identity, such as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the American people, that is, 21 million persons who are necessary for the voting age, does not have the identity card with a photograph of the government of their state.
In addition, 5 million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
The cost of obtaining the required proof of identity are often more than $ one hundred.
New restrictions will disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income communities.
In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than $ 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 did not have the required photo identification.
But that is not all.
Students - voters, which is believed to vote for Democratic candidates, in several states are not allowed to use the identity card with a photograph of their educational institutions.
But the same States allows members fishing and hunting clubs, which vote mostly Republicans, to be used for voting of the certificate issued by the clubs.
Until 2004, no state did not require proof of us citizenship for voting.
The first time such a requirement was imposed in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are us citizens.
This, obviously, is designed to limit the vote of the people from Latin America.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, eliminating the registration of voters on election day in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to help those who wish to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped to make lists about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
The Republican lawmakers in five other states have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early, were African American, although the latter was only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike White, who, forming, 76% of voters among those who voted early at only 46%.
Of course, legislators - Democrats and their supporters actively oppose the adoption of laws limiting voter registration.
Several pieces of legislation was governors Democrats.
Action the most controversial laws was suspended by the intervention of the President of the United States.
This has enabled in part to limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of photo identification.
Nevertheless, the new rules, which came into effect, of course, would hamper the implementation of the vote in the 2012 elections.
Of criticism from Democrats condemn the bias of the law, which was adopted, seeing in them a clear direction, trying to influence the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
Report of the Brennan Center from 2011 shows that states, these laws, who represents 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that the legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
Only one thing is certain: the new provisions would have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense of such action partly discredited system of American democracy.

Screening for prostate cancer: to be tested or not?
In fact, the test for dog gives sometimes erroneous results, negative, and sometimes positive, which leads to wasteful medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to pass health exams, and there is good reason to doubt even more.
To be tested or not?
We ask two specialists.
a study in the United States, has seen numerous cases of infection among groups studied, so the findings are difficult to interpret, and it is difficult to establish any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who underwent screening, and those who did not take place.
The study also found, after a 12-year-old observation that the odds of metastasis 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to be tested since 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decisions, as cancer found.
Cancer can be as aggressive, and semi-dormant.
The patient needs to explain the risks of his cancer, offering him options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and given the choice, in these cases, in favor of an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men, who identified cancer, will not get treatment, because their cancer is not aggressive and not life-threatening.
We will be offering active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly we define the criteria for deciding who should or should not receive treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still to be tested.
But it is also important to check with your doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not to pass the test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created, to assess the pros and cons have a test on him.

To prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe, to prevent cancer.
Despite progress of scientific research, and of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if everyone had had enough and was moving, about 30% Del raco have been averted.
"If nobody smoked, the figure rose to at least 50%," said Andre Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, the estimated 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remains utterly inexplicable.
For Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains the priority, despite a decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking related to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is a colossal damage the health of the people.
"Even today in Quebec has 1500 thousand smokers," says spokesman Andre Beaulieu.
Encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting at risk from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
The car, overweight and obesity also contributed to the rise of the disease.
It increases the risk of breast cancer, thick and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime, and protects against Colon cancer," says the Association.
Food
Association also consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Avoid also increased.
In the meat by smoking, drying or, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage cells in the body and lead to the development of cancer," says the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists are engaged in the research of the influence of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies mixed.
Scc according to the study of the vitamin E gives conflicting results.
If one of them showed reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
The assessment of the impact on the development of cancer of the vitamin D is also a lack of clarity.
But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their fears and family history is important to discuss with your doctor.
"Testing does not lead to cancer."

Higgs boson in the details
Last summer to suggest that scientists may have been able to find the Higgs boson, caused this boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that the bosons explains the bulk of the particles in the universe, nothing so much.
Moreover, this is the last part, the existence of which predicted by the standard model is our best, or, in any case, "The least imperfect" description of nature and behavior of matter, but that is something we have not been able to find an experienced by.
But are not yet sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with really new particles and that she strongly resembles Higgs boson, predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is clear that, although to be sure, some data is not enough.
Will provide all the same, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, as a chance to make a mistake seems minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world one law is inevitable, saying that the two things can not be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule, there is no way they are not trying too hard, otherwise it will hurt yourself.
But while particle physics is a strange world, it turns out, that there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of excluding Realencyclopädie, which suggests that the two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "Quantum state" is "Condition" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
The particle physics divided into two categories.
In one corner, we are good citizens, called, which was obey the principle Realencyclopädie.
On the other hand, tend to like the infamous mob of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they may instead be water and the same place at the same time.
The site (by the way, extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory in Berkeley, like this, in turn, is divided into two groups: mesons, who we will not speak, and "Particles of force," which extends the main force of nature and to which in some ways include Higgs boson.
The very least, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic creature, as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read the story, it is for one incredibly banal Beauzon: the photon, or "Particles of light," which is "Courier of" electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when one is known, with electrical charge, is accelerating or changing direction, it is "Violating" electromagnetic field in this particular place, the way a stone thrown down in a pond.
The "Violation" is born electromagnetic wave of (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this surge is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the headline of "Carriers of force."
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that, if those Beauzon appeared, should be "Broken" another floor, Higgs field.
But the Higgs field far, far more stable electromagnetic fields; to take, to achieve very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond surface, which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That is why we need huge of particle accelerator, like those that have been operating at Cern - large Hadron Collider, a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such an enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and Mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, and there is no piece of paper, for example, never itself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs, he will interact, wealth, while others (like a photon, by the way) it does not have.
So, what "Can do" all these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test whether the Standard Model (see), and it also allows physicists to find the gap between the observations and predictions see.
In fact, some of them passionately wants such discrepancies are discovered, because the slightest discrepancy may open the door for "New physics" and to plug some holes of a model.
The last, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, without offering any explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh - oh!).
But the Cern of such conflict is not found.
Consequences
Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories would not assume that the revolution would cause their work.
They foresaw their application in science, but not much more.
In fact, already late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where in 1960, was invented the laser, and who developed the first continuous laser (previous was a pulse) in 1962, said the originally laser was seen as a "Laboratory gadget."
Imagine...
And besides, the application can be found for tools, accompanying the study.
For example, the same Uilliard Boyle at the time of its optical research in 1969 developed a sensor light.
The sensor, though it was not its original intent, now serves as "Eye" for all digital cameras of the world and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the large Hadron Collider will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... | "Debt"
The Commission for decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate is soon to be back in the meantime, a bill.
Nevertheless in this critical area much remains to be done.
"Debt" tried to look out for.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Has lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, destroyed his inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I gave five years, I have had seven," he says, between life and death, lying in the bed in the shelter of palliative care viktar - Gadbua in Beloeil, where profits before.
"But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he said.
The disease does its work: the incredible weakness, which do not let yourself go to the bathroom and even to eat.
Sitting on the table, which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that he helped to feed.
He is facing us, even manage to smile, to talk to strangers who work around him, made him the drugs, lead him in a bathtub.
Courage to death.
"My biggest wish to have recovered from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
Few hours after staff found a cure for the disease.
"In the course of life teaches us that a man must urinate standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the shelter of Victor - Gadbua.
To regress to the condition of the child - for some intolerable humiliation.
"It all depends on the person's ability" to come to terms with the decline, he says.
As, according to many people in palliative care, an important event happens in the midst of this decline.
Patients palliative, which goes to the orphanage viktar - Gadbua, all had cancer.
Projections giving them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more assistance, called "Therapeutic."
Ms. A., 89 years old, are most afraid to die "In awareness from suffocation."
But the disease has made me start.
"I have a good children," she added.
"I do not want to live," she said, before being allowed to put her mask to breathe.
It is still waiting for the final days of the recent visit of his son, who came from Italy.
In the orphanage viktar - Gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food.
This is palliative care, which is when that nothing can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants have a place in the field of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Then life goes on in the best conditions, which is possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel is one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether comfortg physical, emotional or mental.
Dying we would agree to provide oral rinse of Brandy or Pepsi, watching that he will ask.
Diabetikov we do not make sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we served beer, Mr. H., who died today at night.
On the morning of his son, swilled down a beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We are close, as well as patients," says Natalie Savart, director of patient care.
In the orphanage viktar - Gadbua no day is like the previous one.
Near the 93-year-old man, who enjoy their last meeting with the family in the yard, Party on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically die young man of 36, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and try everything to survive.
"In recent months from three to five beds, is busy cancer patients under 45 years of age" - looking says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients, taken to a shelter viktar - Gadbua, come from homes, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, or care, which is given to reduce the suffering, who entered the final stage of life, for example, at home, in the hospital or shelter.
And some others, such as shelter viktar - Gadbua and Society of palliative care at home to a large Montreal are more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
It is this a large gap in the health care system of Quebec has led many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of the law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October is a manifesto signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr Balfurom Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapuant and indicating their disagreement with such an initiative.
In the words of Dr. Christian Martel, the health care system of Quebec doing enough to secure the right to palliative care of high quality, before the transition will be allowed to euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the intensive care unit, in terrible pain, and no one had taken the necessary measures to ease.
I am afraid that patients want to die, only because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day are trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hope of survival Ellen Richard has already been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist, I stop treatment, she said, sorry that I am giving up the struggle, she said.
However, she told me that my days are numbered!
All-powerful care not.
Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank the medical staff, the way they did not fulfill their request, after the team in palliative care for their pain.
But it must be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with pain.
Fujio she Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at the home of a Montreal, patients are not susceptible to disease prevention in 8% of cases.
In the end the lives of physicians often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps up to the time of his death, or from time to time, or time.
Can no longer pretend that we do not know about the suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, there is always the same: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I thought I had an euthanasia," which means "I want I became easier."
The creation of this report was made possible by the journalistic Grant from the Institute for the Study of the health of Canada.

Large-scale real-estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, of the political parties and the Italian Mafia day after day tell what they know about the enormous "System," entangling the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia.
"Industry," which is proved costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how soon this system, after in the case all means, joked Jacques Dyusheno, deputy and former chief of police of Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011 as scandal is a by-product of the investigation of official misconduct related to road construction contracts in Quebec, Prime Minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly.
"Report Dyusheno" established direct link between industry, secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only to the Department of Transportation would retain the $ billion in contracts," had kept their instincts to take part.
The Commission Charbonneau "Has already shifted two mayors," he added, hoping that it can "To uncover the scheme, behind individuals."
Permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011.
The case became, in 2011, permanent anti-corruption unit, which includes extensive state of government auditors, criminal investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, employees of a special unit "Hammer" after 2009, made "Sewage cartel of" Montreal, to stop inflating the value of contracts.
In recent weeks have been produced a series of searches, and some municipal officials, notably Frank Zampino and Richard muster with - mayor of a small town, were indicted on fraud and corruption.
On the list - Gilles Vaillancourt, recently retired as mayor of Laval, the third largest cities of the province of Quebec.
His suspected of taking bribes of more government orders.
In addition, the indictment charged with several engineers of Service of transport of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
The last detonated the bomb, after an investigation of "System of" receiving government contracts.
Zambito for several years to 3% of the value of the contracts, signed in Montreal, a mediator, associated with the Mafia, which, in turn, sent money to the mayor, Gérald Tremblay "United Montreal."
In the 2000s Zambito money and he spent more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) in various parts of the province, mostly liberals, then in power.
Moreover, he admitted that he was illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party natali Normando.
Sewer contracts, in which the inflated price.
In Montreal, "System of" corruption has worked incredibly well.
Gilles Syurprenany, a former civil engineer for construction, has described her before the Commission over the ten years he has received from construction firms of gifts, invitations to travel, play golf, in restaurants, on matches on ice hockey and bribes for a total of $ 736,000 for sewer contracts, money which he over-valued.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that he took on his paw, account for 30-40% with the help of false additions.
One organizer of the Party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay is that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of the parallel budget, the party's office of dirty money.
After the revelations Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal in deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first MPs in Montreal, who in alarm.
Mayor of the District of Rivière - des - Preri in the east of the island, it faces from the 2010 sale of municipal area, bought for $ 5 million and sold for... 1600 thousand developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that the investigation, which will eventually be launched, it "Will pull the plug, to further understand the functioning of the system, the swarming ants, to stop gangrene and identify those responsible."
The process she described as "Painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will be necessary to have their own investigative team and Observer, in order to avoid questionable practices.
As we go back home.
Regularly.
Jacque Dyusheno notice for its part, that "Officials stole hundreds of $ million," but it is concerned about the role of the "Elected officials who knew about the scheme," but not involved in the fraud.
Given that the proportion of dirty money in campaign financing in Quebec is 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was merely a reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec has to limit to $ 100 of the donations, but, he said, it would not change the situation: "So far we are not going to limit election spending, in politics, will be dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of the award of public contracts and financing of parties: "We can not go below; you should do, we will be able to build a home on a firmer footing, with the best control and rule of law."
If this history and casts doubt on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Dyusheno call on those laughs, to look to their own yard...

"- not Paris St Germain FC Barcelona!"
This season you are in Paris St Germain has made extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual conscience, but can - and a new dimension Paris St Germain.
Profits great players.
Beside them I am growing every day.
Technical staff also much added.
These factors makes me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football everything was happening very quickly.
But I did not have nothing.
From the start in the centre of preparation in nif is acting as in Klerfonten' and before my arrival in Saint - Etienne I have always walked forward.
Thus, you benefit from competition, the Carlo Ancelotti...
Increase this summer is not a surprise to play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
As a result, the player, as I want to be at the level and be made available to the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti support in my position.
He helps the deputies, as claude Makélélé, who played in the position where I am.
Ancelotti - control of the market?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect the technical staff.
Today in the first League there is no equal and it is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January I had with him was encouraging conversation.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
Trust, which it turns out, also explains my achievement.
What do you think of the first part of the season Paris St Germain?
The first League Lyon took from us the leader.
But we are still at the ready.
One of our main objectives is of Champions League: we effectively constitutes a 8th final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to be as widely as possible.
All can be.
We will be able to have its say face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in a 8th final.
Whether Paris St Germain to become a top European club in the short term?
He has already there are budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win titles and to consolidate positions in the long term.
Today it is not.
Financially from Paris St Germain have the means to make this project a real.
Not to take the title in the first League, as in the past season, will be a failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we actually earnestly hope to win the world title.
Last season we were to this close.
In may, was disappointed, because we had all, to reach the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points suggest the title of champion.
But elsewhere, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, are going to be all right.
Despite the fact that the fight for the title came as such a strong team, Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the power to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much as we do and what players.
We are fully prepared.
On the other hand, when we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit sad.
We wonder what in the first place are waiting for people.
We will never be able to win every weekend to 4-0.
We do not F. C. Barcelona.
We are trying to implement a project of the game.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the League of Champions, that can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which is already two seasons can not seem to get to the last 8th final, although they have spent a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, we were 15 points ahead in the winter break.
It would disregard for our opponents and to the French.
Lyon and Marseille, who was not at the height of last season, was "Awakened" this new Paris St Germain.
It shows how exciting first League.
I hope that in may we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, from the exploits zlatan ibragimovich.
And that if they say that there is a "Zlatanozavisimost'."
It means that ibragimovich very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to this and he proves that he is a huge star League.
Where he played, he showed that he is a great player and star of a global scale.
The group we respected as a person and as a player.
He also respect the people that surrounds it.
What he did, it is really only.
It stimulates and others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivate all to move forward.
As you have experienced Euro -2012 with France?
As a disappointment.
I very much wanted to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to grab a little playing time.
I saw there are many things, and I came back stronger.
Today I can play good qualifying matches.
This is what I hoped for with the moment of my baptism in Blue.
We have learned some lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and we now have to behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of the first months of Didier Deshama led Blue?
It is for him.
He has a good position to qualify for the group to the Championship.
He strict coach, he is close to the players and inspire victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc has achieved its goal, he qualified us in the euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue in Brazil.
a deserved draw out (1-1), October 16 in Spain are fundamental game?
That gave us confidence.
Each fought for all.
The shock in Spain, in my career there was no such matches.

Moreover, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current currency system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, all, invented. Satoshi nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency convertible (but in dollars, euros...) and secure exchange like Bittorrent, which allows for the sharing of files between participants a level.
About 200,000 operations has already been registered with 15,000 computers in networks.
Several thousand sites take a venue for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.
Course, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June of 2011, five months later, fell to $ 2, before today to return about $ ten (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
It was nothing compared with the global exchange real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes whaling as "The most successful virtual currency," "Competing with the dollar or euro" and "Like a common currency."
Bitkoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as "Credit" used to promote the video game, which is made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes to trade).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the operation of the exchanges are always in control and handle any central authority.
In Bitkoyny all parts of the network is simultaneously holders of the ledger, auditors, issuers of currency, buyers and sellers.
As running the network?
Each transaction between two users is going on between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only payment for each user can choose another address, thereby ensuring anonymity.
a set of information relating to the deal, sign up for e-mail, using the system of encryption with dual-key.
The network can also check the authenticity of the deal.
With the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that a venue in the deal, really exists in the public accounts book, was sent across the Web.
Key stage is the registration of new transactions in this book.
It passes through mathematical task, which was distributed to computers, determined which, like a temporary central bank, will receive the privilege to add this new line.
It is about phase of hash of the file, that is the transformation of a large file in digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "Take" new transaction and add to her room, before "To be hashed using" all together.
The goal is to find, which offers a unique digital signature (many zeroes in the beginning).
As soon as it is found, among other sites easily verify that it correctly.
Transaction thus are inextricable linked with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature.
If the user to lie very quickly (less than ten minutes) would be willing to pay twice one and the theme of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signature.
Computer, ready to challenge for 50.
To avoid inflation, the rewards are divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
Number in circulation therefore limited to 21 million, but it is one-millionth, leaving a pool...
The difficulty of the task also increases with the computing power.
The life of the network has had ups and downs.
Sites, providing the services of all, was attacked, and a stolen from the reserves.
"The defect is not for the Protocol" - said Pierre NUAZ, which recently launched Paymium - company engaged in payments real money with the use of a network you.
The ECB also reported the possibility of money laundering through these anonymous Service.
But money also has this defect.
Big players, such as Wikipedia, refuses to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as Wordpress blogging platform, their permitted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from weitzmann in Israel, analyzed by the book and found that almost 80% does not exist in turnover.
"Huge sell-off" was announced in November.
"30 thousand dollars was traded," rejoice jonah holmquist, working in Coinabul, which is engaged in converting in gold.
Pierre NUAZ, the other author of books on the currency, firmly believe in the potential of this technology as the operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (and money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but she uses need to review the transaction, which thus are cheaper.
The better control their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not have to set a new device or software.
It is enough to tell the address, which you can "To photograph and recognize" the phone, says Pierre NUAZ not to worry, because he already has thousand users.
There is a general trend of the revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of a more conservative.
"Before you is established, it will take some time, but 2013 will be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in his report suggests, by the way, to reconsider a variety of risks, which is now elevated, in the case of the success of this system.

We left Afghanistan.
What is next?
French troops left his area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa province and Surob').
NATO and the Americans should follow in late 2014.
For the Afghan Army it is time to regain control of its territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only to us.
We suffered in a major Afghan peasants, which we considered as terrorists.
We, with 88 dead soldiers, and wounded and disabled.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders, hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as it did with the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their tradition, old and archaic, even if they are joined by, jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Their suffering, they sometimes helps local insurgents, but they will no longer, as soon as the West will adopt a delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from bases Nidzhrab, which I watched from the hills with almond trees by the French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles to escort helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked.
Since the 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
Circumstances have changed since the days of their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of a struggle between different groups.
Taking them under the control of the country then be seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the bigotry of the peasants, in which they were full of al - qaeda, but their condition has improved and these days.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They had turned into traders, exciting state land to sell them under construction, with its return from Iran and Pakistan, with huge American contract manufacturer.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, even have not.
People, as I have heard in rural areas, like the government, consisting not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will leave those who have managed the American generosity: the outflow of capital are significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world in a time of exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantage.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; in Kabul, there are 5 million residents, one 5th of the total population.
Public schools in towns filled, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for the young people who do not want to go back or to bigotry of the old parties, nor for the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represents the modern world, and is looking everywhere.
At the moment the army is.
Power, which will be her to command, would that be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, conducting anti-Soviet struggle, had already taken measures to restore the provincial militia, which would not be reported to the central government.
Afghanistan, mountainous country with a strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, in the manner of the Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, by Prime Minister, which has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April of 2014.
But his country, since the 50s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
Industry had not been on their feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is not repaired.
All imported; nothing is done, except fruit and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control over the infrastructure would be needed.
It was rumoured that Afghanistan has vast mineral riches.
It is only strengthened the impression that Western countries were there, only to their own.
Without power for the processing of iron ore and copper in place, without the means of transport, in order to export them through the mountains, there is a production.
The Chinese lindsayalmost left field of Aynak copper months, leaving international archaeologists (world Bank-funded) to dig into a huge Buddhist complex and to be the largest employers of the province.
, too, needs to be in one day equal attention from Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, for boys, the faculty at the University of the French language, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support of archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 in an effort "To win the hearts and minds" to do the impossible task of reconciling with offensive operations, Service "Civil - military activities" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), closed in 2012, along with a small French public organizations, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of Agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, with intense involvement of local labor force, could help stem the rising: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, the protection of soil and increase the amount of arable land.
We will leave it to the memory of their own, spending 2 billion euros on military spending?
Far more modest budget had an improvement in the living conditions of the local population, very severe in the valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2000 meters above sea level.
Embassy received dozens of written requests for the implementation of the small farming activities, coming from local communities in the province of Kapisa province.
To get rid of uprisings, led by foreign groups, wants farmers, as they would say to me, you have to give them a small non-military support, which would be well controlled and came to them directly.

Heavy delivery of the Constitution of Egypt
It is a risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily give him emergency powers, he decided to play vabank.
Outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text of the following day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and lead to legal controversy.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
In the opinion of his opponents, President, persisted in his "Autocratic Brédou," while continuing to violate "The word" and "To flout the law."
In the camp of his followers believe it is the way out of the institutional and political crisis, hastening the transition process.
The referendum should be held within fifteen days.
a very short period of time, which makes brothers to abandon its intention to explain the Egyptians text, article-by-article.
For president is also to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while the discontent raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, it seems, is convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the US weekly time.
The call to vote like an ultimatum of the Egyptian people, "Or you vote for my text, or I keep emergency powers," which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of the 85 Assembly members, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to make their own opinion.
Representatives of human rights activists, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
Necessary quorum was reached, 11, a spare participants, was hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that, in most cases, the article was imt voted unanimously.
Kommentatorov, by the way, cheering the fact that one of the few differences of the day occurred around... Time for prayer, as some members of the Committee decided that hours of the Constituent Assembly was incorrectly configured.
The text, which yesterday was still voting, consists of 234 articles.
The focus of attention, paragraph 2 remained identical article from the 1971 Constitution that "The principles of sharia is the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoping to replace the "Principles" on the "Rules" that would enable them more strictly enforced.
For Islamists the fact that the article was not adopted, are evidence of their good will and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," said liberals, which sees it as a public relations.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the Constitution is going through another article.
They point in particular to Article 220, which will give Al - Azhar University advisory role, in particular, as regards the adoption of Sharia laws.
According to an expert on Egypt's Sophie Pommiers, it is alarming, T. K. "Individuals, designed to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the beginning of a theocracy ."
Many liberals, moreover, is alarmed fact that the next President of the University, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current one.
" At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With the Constitution we remain within the framework of civil rights.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, is not ulamo, and people with a university degree, some were trained in the French system " Says Alexis BLYY, which is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that " Around 220 may be ambiguity, as used in terms it is a religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "Fikh" [Islamic law, the Sarbanes - oxley.].
And in the future may be, the question is whether the civil judge competent to decide about this. "
In addition to their religious aspect, text, adopted yesterday, facing criticism, because it gives broad powers of the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brotherhood claims that they be significantly reduced compared with what was under the old regime.
Another controversial issue: the powers of the Army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will not be held in Parliament, and the National Council of Defense.
Also would not be barred from the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the request of human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they believe is disastrous for freedom.
Held responsible for blasphemy, and is now banned assault, which could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for press freedom.
Moreover, none of the articles do not speak about the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayefy, of human rights watch.
According to her, the only positive thing a ban on torture in 36.
Words, which has not been seen in the previous constitution.
While Egyptian President were to perform last night on television, protests are scheduled today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"Great and powerful" to Moscow will bring: migrants will save money for language
While lawmakers and human rights activists argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing, in the country have already emerged fraudsters selling "Phony" certificates
Annually in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities are 13 million guest workers.
Big part of it is citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families back home.
The law came into force on December 1, according to which each migrant worker would have to take the exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
These rules apply only to those who intend to be in the business of care, housing, community and retail trade.
However, the promises, in mbf tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
With to take will have not only language, Noi Russian history, and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to acknowledge and to obtain, and for the extension of the work.
Exceptions only for the citizens of those countries, where Russian is the official language.
Not fall under the law and people, who had to obtain certificates and diplomas on education to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Favor, doomed and protection of human
The examination centres will be working under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language the Pushkin, University of the friendship of peoples, and Saint petersburg state University and other universities.
To pass tests migrants will in all cities; now in Russia has opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative for the introduction of the test was also supported by members of the Parliament, and mbf.
But human rights advocates, before the law took effect, many times raised in the press question: what is it, exactly, will give?
He would change the obligation of knowledge of the language and for Russians, and for the people?
First of all, said representatives of migration services, in order to reduce the number of people suffering from "Labour slavery."
Very many say about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of the delegation mbf of Russia in Tajikistan viktar Sebelev.
Protect their rights should start to their departure.
Only system of organized set will allow 90% to solve the problem of foreign workers.
The problem are migrants without occupation, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, says Sebelev, the future of migrants are doomed to deal with unscrupulous people who under the guise of aid will focus is on putting him "a start" in a close Barak, where he and dozens of others like him will be months to languish without food and documents, giving 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise, and upon arrival they are cheated out of a passport to pay promised salary" - confirms the director of the Department of Labor migration icj of Tajikistan Tolib sharipov.
Do not swear, rapist!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who work in Russia, it is recognised that not only did not know the language of the country which seeks, but also on their own write with Labour.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, how much trouble: the few turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a sensible primary education.
Because their families can even to feed the children, not to mention the fact that got them to dress, may wear and equip in school.
Dorastaya to adolescence, the guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if poorly with knowledge of the language, they confess.
"Feel humiliated and challenged."
However, in respect of the law on language rights advocates said an important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
Status if not, it will not be the next test, no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the migrants are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or no trespassing"
Many of the newcomers say that to get official status in this country is not so easy.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and the same language difficulties.
Moreover, legalizing money's worth from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be done quickly and just thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know, too, that we mostly false documents, no registration, hence the extortion.
"Ask hundreds, two on cigarettes, tea,," said to reporters a Tajik Umeda Khushkadamov.
"Naletay, do not be stingy, buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it emerged that the migrants are not only false registration documents.
a few "Phony" certificates of language tests have already withdrawn staff mbf.
Fake paper printed on ordinary printer.
Of course, they got new owners were not for free: each of migrants to death by brigands hoping to facilitate that the tests, paid 7 thousand rubles.
It is more than two times more than the formal testing: it will cost migrant worker in 3 thousand.
That the main task for the near future is to protect the system of corruption, to "The Bottom" it was just to buy, converge and the authorities, and human rights activists.
As long as authorities can promise guest workers, having failed to successfully testing the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, people who do not know English, will be offered work in the area, without active contact with people.

Mvd do not take on the illegal market turnover of weapons
The percentage of crimes with the use of illegal weapons are extremely low
The Interior Ministry's offer to enforce the law in respect of the owners of civilian weapons.
The reaction of the authorities at the recent incidents: to hit shots at weddings, when without injury, and slaughter a Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, in which to push seven people were killed.
The police want to ban the wearing injuries in public places and to raise the age in which to get a license for weapons, from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on security and anti-corruption iryna yarovy and promised that amendments to the law on weapons to make the Duma in the near future.
Not all are pleased that the Russian authorities are trying to tackle the problem by "Tightening the screws."
In the net open letter, written by the representatives of various public small organizations want to abandon the "Senseless tightening."

For the Interior Ministry, in the first six months of 2012, committed 142 crimes involving the use of firearms, registered in internal affairs, while just over the same period, there were 1168 thousand crimes.
The authors of an open letter to believe that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons do not criminal to go on "Black" market.
Now in Moscow, according to them, you can find any weapon at affordable prices.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry said that control the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers from factories to officers

The form of "Black weapons" - stolen by criminals among the representatives of the security forces.
Baranets said, it also includes blown off the police warehouses, and stolen from directly to law enforcement officials.
Illegal "Baggage" goes on sale with military warehouses.
On many military warehouses often bombings.
"Has proven that the part of the arson was made specifically to cover emergency," former military.
a contribution, in the words of Huperzia, make the producers of weapons.
"There is now a fruitful private arms factories, who did not compete on the international market and throw weapons from under the floors on the black market, including Moscow's," says expert.
Another source "Black" market - smuggling.
Many neklyayev pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its production, sometimes a home-made, and it is a Mafia, who organized the flow" - former military.
Where weapons?
Experts thought, what is the approximate each share of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on "Black" market.
The report of that in 2011 produced the centre of the troubled analysis and public administration buildings.
Specialists reviewed the statements and rosstat, criminology literature and open the portals for arms issue.

The seller and buyer often find each other through the familiar.
I did on the sites, blogs, has not responded to a friend, which offered to come to the platform "A," where the man who will get me in the "Corner," where we will be traded.
The price of the barrel, I learned only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
To get the trunk I need a friend, who is out - seller - consultant. - I have a friend, but I did not know.
Sellers in the markets, but it would also need to have, figuratively, "From Ivan Ivanovich, which asked to convey that the baby tooth out."
I am now even a couple of knuckledusters gets through, which I am sure.
He is their unique to me, because I know that I will not give up.
For novices looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid 1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
The scheme, he said, has not changed.
He had made the album with Photos, where "Anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, does not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - we went with the seller in the forest, it puts the target.
"I was given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that weapons beat well, begins to trade," describes the procedure expert.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet on Web sites and in the "Last piece," which offers to buy weapons "For different purposes."
It does not need any documents and personal meeting.
"Enough to have a certain amount of money," writes in the advertising cap on the "Battle to buy a machine."
The users leave their bid and ask questions.
And minors will sell?
"Without a license of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buying TT. Moskva" - to use up the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service are now spread over a vast network of front pages and want to buy firearms row a shovel.
People go, like fish on, and then coal mine in Siberia
Military commentator and former military Viktor Baranets
I have heard of such schemes: usually site registered beyond the reach of the Russian laws.
People taking orders.
The ATM pay.
"In response to send pictures and regulations, where hidden weapons," says a spokesman for the "Right to bear arms" Dmitry kislov.
Viktor Baranets argued that leaving the application to the site, you can be without weapons and to get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service are now spread over a vast network of front pages and want to buy firearms row a shovel.
"People go, like fish on, and then extract in Siberia coal," he says.
Makariv for $ 100
The purchase of illegal small arms, according to experts, is to meet in amounts ranging from $ 100 to $ 900.
According to dimitri kislov of the "Right to bear arms," Makarov pistol can be had for $ 100-300.
Will have to wait a month and a half.
He is from warehouse storing the leadership of the warehouses of middle management.
According to the official statistics agency, compared with January - October of 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia fell by 7% to 22,900, and the number of registered cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.

In the US workers on strike fast food and supermarkets
a development fund "Mcdonald's" go up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days of America, a wave of protests against low wages in the Corporation's Walmart stores and restaurants of popular networks of fast food, such as "Mcdonald's," "Burger King," "Taco Bell," "Uendis" and "Kentucky fried chicken."
No one is ready to predict, will become if this wave in 9th shaft or it is destined to become obsolete in the early stages.
Shares support unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In improving the modest salaries, which are ordinary workers Walmart and a system of fast food, the aim of the protests is the creation of them trade unions.
As this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents in the year?
Shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America was hit by an orgy of-sales, coupled with millions of people and sometimes with hardcover editions.
On this day, some employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which around the world try 2.2 people, have left their jobs and had picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists of the company, whose products are for people with modest and middle-income countries.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores, on average, from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many low-wage workers Walmart come only on the job.
Availability and goods made a Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
, critics say, Walmart can afford to sell goods off in part because little pay their workers.
The latter also complain about the harsh working conditions, for example, the shortage of trucks or hand-held scanners.
The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" was to increase salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by, jumped from $ 30 to $ 100 a month.
a typical worker Walmart, receiving $ 9.5 a hour, the expense can not afford, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will increase the minimum wage to $ 12 a hour, it will cost the company $ 3.2.
Is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If Walmart will pass wage growth at the expense of buyers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more expensive.
a year they will have to spend some $ 12.39 more than...
Supporters Walmart, a noted that the protest occurred only in nine states and corporations did not cause any damage.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday, to midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In its cash registers in "Black Friday" almost 100 of the transactions.
The representative of the Corporation Deng Fogelman claimed in an interview left the site the Huffington Post that jobs left a total of "Less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was just "Another public relations stunt" for her Union.
"Free cash!"
The protests have continued this week in New York, where the object was no department stores Walmart (their progressive in this town do not complain about, and it is not), and "' ses" and other cheap restaurants.
Mcdonald's says that he sold billions of meals, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work!
Dzhumeyn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
In the current minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $ 7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants eventually increasing it, but not much, and their average ordinary workers are in New York on $ 8.90 a hour.
Less them in this expensive town do not earn no one.
As you can exist in New York for the money, to me, is incomprehensible.
Once through "' ses" there is been almost a quarter of American teenagers, which job for their shelves after school, living with her parents.
Few saw this as a main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly thwarted by interviews with employees of "Makdonaldsov," which complain that they have to live on the salaries and sometimes even to feed on her children.
On the other hand, the Forum of a Wall Street Journal commentary, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know what you will be their stomachs.
Of the protesters, which began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday the "Mcdonald's" on 40 Street and Madison Avenue, insisted that the cashiers and chefs of the system of fast food began to pay at least $ 15 a hour, more than doubled their current minimum wages.
They also demanded that in the area of fast food was created by Labor Organization.
American law prohibits it to prevent and punish union leaders harassed and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration is rarely easy life.
But to cover Union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons.
One of the main - extraordinary turnover of staff.
The dissenting
Noisy protests took place in the day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the shares in the mid-afternoon rally in "Mcdonald's" near Times Square, where several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who said: "Mcdonald's" says that he sold billions of meals, and after that he did not even give you a hospital and do not pay you for honest work. "
Demonstrantov supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, candidate for Mayor Bill de Blasio, which said that "We must all join in support of the workers of fast food, so that they have achieved fairly and economic well-being, which deserves every new."
As the events of the New York Times, it was the largest this kind in the history of American sphere of fast food.
But it had only a few hundreds of people, and not all of them were quick to the public, in which workers in New York employs thousand people.
It is unclear whether this would create a spark of the movement.

"As long as there are brain receives medium"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality lately taken to treat mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First summer at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then, in November, it became known that the application for the patent filed and Microsoft.
But from a conversation with the head of the group interactive 3 D technology in Cambridge laboratory Microsoft Sharam Izadi is that scientists piercy points - time passed.
Their lures the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
- Tell, please, in general terms, what do your research group?
- We are human interaction with machines, but has been trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
As long as mankind in the group stuck in the process of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking a finger in them.
We want to look at 5-10 years and to predict radical changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and sensors kinect is a step forward, and almost every Xbox today without kinect is not for sale, for all the interesting sign management.
- That is the way forward?
- Despite the fact that kinect juliana cooperation on a physical level, much still have a flat screen, sometimes in 3 D.
The introduction of the data has improved (system get more data), and the conclusion is.
We are trying to change, is working on a-D systems display on the basis of various technologies, including projective.
Need to release the computer world in our physical, to make it more visible.
For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but the space around it.
Then we will be able to add to the real world of virtual objects in far more convenient form.
First and foremost to hell with the stupid helmet of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice control?
Popular thing, but do not overestimate whether or not it?
- It certainly can not be called a panacea - question of Privacy, because they do not always want to be around them about their actions and intentions.
In fact all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone in their niche.
For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over, and over such a short, short.
The gestures he did not have a camera, a device and wrist bracelet that monitors the movement of bones and muscles.
He is great, but it can theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But the future for a type of mixed management, for example, a gesture + voice.
Is how?
- For example, as you ask me to convey to you the banks of a soda?
You say and at the same time will tell.
- I usually just said.
Oh, it will be very difficult to discern.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not for the moment, the car?
- It is not necessary, but it is mutual rapprochement.
I think, in the near future we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will be used to shape the reaction of the people.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they provide a good resolution depth, it is very important.
- If we are talking about your work with sensors Xbox kinect, what you claim to modern cameras?
Do not have permission, depth or something?
- In principle the current generation is the thing, which can make a start in our work over-recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it is not megapixels, and as the Matrix and depth.
With the last point of view all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds work, the designers of algorithms.
Had to remember not only about resolution x and y axes, but Z.
Is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The movement of persons a dynamic, and the 30 K / with a clearly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmondskiy laboratory made the touch with adjustable delay in processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) share.
Do not all understand how this affects the interactions between man and machine.
I would be in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, but does not require its that frames per second was more.
- And the number of cameras to increase not need?
- Kinect now there are three "Camera," one of whom - infrared emitter, and the second receiver of reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, see the normal range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially large number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate her, increasing extent required calculations.
It would be possible to create a flexible analog kinect, to play with the curvature of the location of cameras and to see how this will help in identifying the top of the situation.
- As I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented the public for their points.
Not you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk around with a smartphone in his hands, not very comfortable, but that is what I think: the most drastic option would be "Rolling" augmented reality, when on the basis of cloud platform you could switch with glasses on the Web, head-up display and a lot of other locations.
Points is a very personal device, in which the forces of the (private things only see you), and, at the same time, weak - augmented reality on the basis of points will allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air from the Tony stark of "Iron man," but mere mortals.
There is one problem, which often critics of such ideas: no tactile feedback!
Hands do not feel anything!
What answers your group is preparing to the challenge?
- In his lectures I often say that augmented reality is the 7th breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think, 8th may well be adaptablements of tactile sensations.
It is an interesting tricks - the use of second hand as a background in image.
It is registered doubleckick!
But there is technology, which is aimed at giving these "Pictures in the air of" tactile feedback - interference for example, several targeted ultrasound beams at a certain point where finger, gives a sense, but it is very weak - as if you blew over the ball.
The bracelets on the wrist, which affects the nerve endings in the fingers are promising direction.
- And you have tried to trick the brain?
Made him think that he feels the fact that they would feel at the moment when he see?
- This is a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
There is another task, which is to beat long - how to make people, are physically present in very limited space, to believe that he is open, almost endless - working on the idea of running tracks (not like the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While not fool the brain is obtained medium, the work is still very much for many years.
That do work on the virtual reality such attractive to researchers - many things in absolutely its infancy.

Were instead of culture - rosbalt. Ru
"Rosbalt" continue the project "Peterburgsky avangarde," dedicated to the citizens, which is ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
The top list got bright people's art scene. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the town, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing Russia acknowledged.
The hero of "Rosbalt" - controversial artist kirill Miller.
The whole town know kirill Miller - bearded man, dressed all in pink, which meet the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, the fashionable parties and Vernissage.
Picture of kirill Miller always a crowd of spectators, wherever they may be exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of a St. Petersburg social, philosophical fortune, the creators of the new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant man of avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
Moreover, he is a man of the City, his appearance on the streets of smile among the citizens, raising the mood.
He recently took the hands of the pirate radio and became St. Petersburg at, as ripe for this complex role all its bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
Kirill, and why are you still go to town is Red, not in yellow and turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red as a fashion designer, in form and image.
In this world Red is a compromise between the artist, fashion designer and society.
The society all, not a bit of gray, causes aggression and excitement of bad property.
But my provocation aimed at giving began the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate.
- And when you realized that there should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Theater nevsky, where it was displayed my work.
I felt it my way.
Then wave old free unofficial artists and new, free type I had vague.
I became friends with artists of new wave, with, which led to "Pushkinskiy -10," and more wave was not.
I get into the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, in words.
- And it is all up in your art - clinic... - I was important to go to the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg, where you will have to collect all the best creative force.
In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkin -10, and there was no repairs, there was a musical and artistic club, bohemian club, home of the St. Petersburg s.
Many there were born: prefectures, tequila - Jazz, remember, like cord led the "Van Gogh's ear."
Cord and his friends sang with plywood of songs, they were in a tight tights, among them was fashionable now composer Igor vdovin.
When the band played live, she became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was leading many programs to Khali - Galichskoye Times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career, and basic education and upbringing he we have received.
Gallery "137," the club of " Griboedov are echoes of art - clinic.
To our employees and manner of tortured left.
I hero of the century, when the culture is to mean anything.
In the 2000 survey was in the press, the award was "People of our city."
In the "Artist of the year" was named I ended my peak.
In New Times by the old rules uncomfortable to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity is divided, it is possible to be popular, but the not - so-cultural.
- Your work in time-honored fashion.
- Many of my picture - it hits, a strong and relevant.
I will be software exhibition, "The Russian Museum in the clowns."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used social were now to be this is hurt and scared.
But in the clowns all brains splattered, the tragedy are off.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque idea.
For example, save the world by totalitarian ones, by order.
Now on clothes found that focuses on foreign mechanics, not on the inner man.
And, maybe he can not throw away and Roger spit it.
And deception will be removed with the help of dressing.
- And we recently saw you in the role of urban -. - cultural city should have such a hero.
It is not for me, they have to be.
- Maybe and commercial art can be beautiful?
- Commercial art should be accurate, nice, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures.
Before people crowded flocks, La bohème one loved, the simplest of them other.
Now all crashed on complicity, it is hard to enjoy all.
I do not each piece of paper everyone to like.
Now need to think, would be like.
Now every cult hero to 100 fans.
- And to Stas mikhailova come for several thousand!
Has come soon, there is sex - social work.
The cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10 will not come, and ultimately less management, money, all languish.
I have fans, the main thing they do not be fooled, do not want to spoil the family.
I wrote in my youth such picture, saying that one collector they are on the wall next to Falk and larionov hung.
I started with paintings, which usually ends.
Now often confusing.
Said: spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from other opera.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, up examples of artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty, uses the money for drawing of the paintings.
I am for this culture.
Kirill, what is missing. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: official from the culture.
But not all of them can be done by culture.
With the Kings all is not as it was, the Kings, maybe not quite sure in culture, but they felt the need to keep the right experts.
In Moscow now good consultants.
We in St. Petersburg people eat, which could be experts, but they are pushed, as more high experts that will evaluate these experts, and give them the road.
Now thriving.
The same Erarta, but their different than what they honestly say that not all modern art we take, there are artists, which must find other museums.
- What-you - petersburg?
- Petersburg - this is not a cultural capital of culture, in Moscow, much more, where the soil is.
And on our stones art to grow difficult.
We need cultural soil, and we writers now more than readers, it is wrong.
In Europe so many people curious. Who attend exhibitions, concerts.
But this layer thin.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.

Was born in space
Land in danger.
Global warming or a collision with an asteroid - killer.
Caravans of the space with the Russians on board sets off to find spare planet.
To save humanity, a key question, as to continue its kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact this planet only two, which can be used at least hypothetically.
"It is Venus and Mars,," said senior researcher at the National Institute of astronomical P. K. Sternberg (under) Vladimir Surdiny.
But if Mars conditions more livable, then on the surface of Venus - temperature of 500 degrees.
You can live only at a high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... In space.
With regard to reproduction in space began with Flora.
a half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.
four generation raised on the orbit of Peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - launch of the insects, tiny fruit flies - fruit flies.
Into space in 1979 sent a couple of quails, to see how to develop an embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
We get out is absolutely normal chicken.
But then the problem.
"The problem with the chicken should find a support, he should get back on their feet and start moving," as head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (ibmp) ran volodymyr SYCHOV.
For support, the Chicks are not around.
And 10 hours, a newborn was full of atrophy of instincts.
The Chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that the next day they were just died.
"And twice we study the eggs, then refused, because you can not just there to work with them" concludes, the failure of the experiment with eggs in space volodymyr SYCHOV.
With animals last biological "Mining" in an orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
But on the satellite "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
Was an experiment on rats, which is sent into space since the fruit.
In principle, there is nothing supernatural.
"It is just been on the Biosatellite program - but again, is an one-off experiment, and such a study to be carried out," says Vladimir SYCHOV.
After landing from space rats appeared offspring.
But to approach the problem of any reproduction directly into space until it receives.
an easy task.
Animals, losing, usual habitat, simply can not fulfil their sexual instinct.
But, unlike animal, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has an abstract thinking, and in a position to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out.
But a woman in space travel for 50 years.
The biggest risk had tereshkovoy.
And the most precious of humanity, is a woman's body.
Our chaika had fled, and no one on Earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space.
Can she give birth to a child after the flight.
"Because this is a question no one answered," says veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June of 1964, just one year after the flight in space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova daughter.
The child's father Andriyan Nikolayev was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, twice attended in orbit and even himself in space, was born son.
But risks remain.
We have very little unit has astronauts which, after the long flight all cost, and grow up healthy generation.
"And if more, that is dangerous even in the orbital flights," says a cosmonaut - hero, hero of the Soviet Union, Russia's Valery Polyakov.
Yet, humanity needs to be looking for a new path in biotechnology, radiation protection, creating an artificial gravity.
Neutral buoyancy laboratory CPC - compulsory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in terms of nbl astronauts jankunas skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If adult water, albeit comfortable, but still a foreign environment, the baby is his element.
Small if confirmed - life on land out of the ocean.
There is a correlation between what he is about 9 months with his mother in amniotic fluid fluid, it is easier to get used to water.
In principle this makes sense, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, only 2 weeks.
"It is just something to forget," says instructor of the mine at the Marina aksenova.
Words, if a child's birth weightlessness more natural, and for women - is gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness the abdomen, pelvis, its ability to push the fetus.
Significant, drop and this, relying on amphetaminetype generic activities.
It is, of course, in a special camera to go to childbirth, will push it.
"Then what?" - not a trivial matters Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, child needs artificial gravity.
With no sense of gravity, the body is not a skeletal and muscular system.
Newborn into orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special full costume for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will be essential.
"And this experiment, in which we will go with the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to that, we will bring in the land of the disabled, fully make human rights," foresee the Committee on Bioethics IMBP apatity ihor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
But, in time, it will be a reality, when Earthlings on the ship will go on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.

The head of the Audit Office: Schwarz - inspection system failed at the hands of politicians.
In the field of public procurement the Czech Republic has a good monitoring bodies and, despite the availability of high-quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.
The statement of myroslav Kāla, vice - president of the Supreme Audit Office, to the site Aktuálně. Cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have the" said the current situation of Calais.
This conclusion for the joint inspection Czech and German authorities of control.
As an example the wrong practice leads approach of Petr Nečas to the so-called Schwarz - system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said the group (Civic Democratic Party) will not be worried by entrepreneurs check - out is prohibited or granted?
"The law should be installed in any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then Prime Minister can not resist the work of the institutions, which are required to check and to meet the commitments," - Calais.
The meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between Czech and German sides, in which was compared the legislation on public procurement both countries.
What exactly was it?
On parallel investigation, which we started, perhaps, two years ago.
Simply put, the question is whether that European legislation say, how should be public procurement, followed by national legislation and then at practice.
The information collected and, even if still unfinished test found interesting differences - in short, the legislation we can be "Accurate and clear," but in practice we have some options than those in Germany.
From this is that it is not enough to create a more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law.
And around this project can help you, he does it mean to you?
Such joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop the precise laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economy means getting such things-to-low (but not always) price, to avoid enrichment and, perhaps, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will reach, reducing restrictions of orders.
Perhaps, this system will mug up "Securities" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than it would have fallen.
You talk about the internal problems of application of the legislation on public procurement.
But as a functioning system of control in Germany?
Is there such as our petersburga (Audit Office) or this work otherwise?
As regards the institutions, something in the quality of our play bundesrechnungshof, based on our principle, there is also a board, who works a little differently, but for the most part, both institutions operate similarly.
Moreover, powers similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a unit of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from our own.
Brh can manage only federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities control at the federal level of counting houses.
For the local legislation, there is easier than us?
In fact, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany could be used as a model, but it is safe to say that she is better in all.
So, because they are better at dealing with control?
But definitely not, I repeat, a comparison does not like.
But I have to say, even an exemplary country faces many challenges.
Otherwise, they would not see any benefit from cooperation with our office, right?
If domestic legislation, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow be felt?
Given that the legal validity of the amendments a short, she still had not shown in our work to control.
As we hold control in fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
Take this into account only in the process of future inspections - we have started to use our new instrument "The risk of detection," through which we ran nearly 14,000 state contracts. We looked at. There are, of course, these changes will also be shown, because change restrictions, change the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the adoption of this law will benefit or additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope this is confirmed.
The problem, which may be, is that the rules "Will tighten" and can not be enforced.
During the previous rules-controlled enterprises deep with the provider (for example, the regional operational programme with the Regional Council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement is a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Is in this case to tighten the law this way?
I think that is not the way.
System should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit formal errors, leaving the decision.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's recognize that the road will not lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said the group will not disturb business checks so-called Schwarz - system. What does that mean?
"Schwarz - system" is prohibited or granted?
The law should be installed in any way, and if he is not allowed to do so, then Prime Minister can not resist the work, which has to check and to meet the commitments.
We can say: "We will change the law and allow it," but you can not say that I was going to pretend that nothing happens.
The law on public procurement rather, as well as what is formally to be held, and rightly so. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic, when the candidate with the best proposal disqualified because of the formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have.

Šimon Ornest': at concerts we want to develop positive energy
What do you think about that, less than one month to the end of the world?
It is only one of many disturbing news, on which we, the people, are easy to get.
Together with the tap tap we always joke on the subject, and that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to bring a positive energy, to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give in a three concert against the end of the world.
Could you to tell readers?
It is about a nationwide fund-raising activities, which we plan for two years now.
We decided to take the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which announced December 21 in 11:10.
The day before, while December 20 in 21:00 starts on three concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at a time when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific time zone, which is 12 hours before we will be able to the calendar.
Who came upon the idea?
Originally it was my idea, we all got together with our artist Gonzoi Augusta.
Moreover, we want to build up enough positive energy and to prevent the end of the world, together we also want them to think about the condition of the world, we will pass on to our children.
At the end of the calendar we have created a unique collection of items of shoes, shirts, bags and original clues to the end of the light of these things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus also to support us.
The tap tap along with other musicians also sang against the end of the world, which is called the "End of the world is abolished."
Will be a favorite listeners joitnscene Pincez this concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end we will get there and the end of the world will not come.
He will find it at all shows simultaneously.
Anthems will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
Words to the song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the clip tomáš Ganac, participate in the performance also Xindl x...
As you start to cooperate with them?
We also work with other people of the Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.
Try to actively engage them on these projects.
It turned out that many like to work with us, it is interesting.
What will go revenues from touring the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational centre STUDEO, for 6th years we have been working with civic associations tap at the Institute of Jedliczka.
Teachers regularly attend school students of the Institute of Jedliczka and spend with them fun and interesting event.
By no means, go to the teachers, and we try to give them the opportunity.
The project of additional construction of the Institute of Jedliczka in the future there will be a separate building, in which we will move forward with the project.
At every concert will be several bands and performers.
What was the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For instance, in Prague will perform chinaski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere by Bartha, the tap tap marián Wu Bangguo and jiří Suchá.
Of all of the details can be found at the site www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such a "Great event" in the future?
In may will be the first to speak at the "Prague Spring" and then, of course, will make an interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would love to have held view in the Czech National home in New York, and I personally, if we are going in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About the countries you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with expensive in terms of organization and logistics???
It is not as scary as it seems.
We have five participants for electric wheelchairs, their child must travel in the cargo hold, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
Nevertheless, dealt with this without problems of Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airlines and British Airways have always been great for us, that prepared me how much of a surprise.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, all passed without problems.
With trips abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled, and so on.
With what you have seen to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where all works better than us, in Russia, we have seen that in the East is still at a basic level.
In comparison to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise move independently of a man in an electric wheelchair into the centre of town.
Also there in the course of such basic things, how to give way to the disabled in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there is a public institution, which is trying to draw people's attention on the problem of people with disabilities.
In the contrary, we need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of play is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe disabilities move on the streets, may go to the toilet, a museum, but anywhere...
There is very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, in that we have with the tap tap a little bit ahead!
Respect of the public or neglect is one thing, but at the moment, when we will be well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then all and will begin to change.
As long as this one-time - people strong-willed.
The tap tap currently very popular, but will return to two years ago that in 1998, you made her to organize?
I entered the Institute of Jedliczka as a teacher, I had many young people who wanted something to do.
And because I am a musician and play including at the saxophone, then he and a colleague has organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, and over time, as our leading Ladya Angelovič, it is a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity came only in recent years, and I have confused?
It is true, we have helped that we have started to join the famous singers and work actively to the propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can estimate, in fact as if they do not exist.
By means of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
Were there before you order so well to get the tap tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is a lot of things, Express one another.
It is logical, all New be taken with caution, and lasts that long.
There is very little rare of things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.
The first man's impression that we see, of course, sorry, that is...
But the pity is over, because people with disabilities are not suffering from any and all the personalities, which we must spare.
They are people who can live a normal life and to develop, of course, only to the extent that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities that it is - then it is not for them, but to all of society.
Have success that you are a strict head, what you would think?
If we want to make it work properly, we should be uncompromising on a lot of things and keep a certain discipline.
But I believe, that is all right.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and in, and when he hears that twice a week, they should go to rehearsal, to attend the preparatory courses and to spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But it is so in any group that want to work and to accomplish something.
In the group-the tap tap twenty.
As it did in the beginning in 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovič.
We open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and strength of will, our door is always open.
He will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 in 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Stadium Incheba, in Brno - the club Fléda and Ostrava - in centre Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
The end of the concert all three cities is connected via a moment of the song of the tap tap "End of the world is abolished."
This project is designed to raise funds in the amount of $ 25 million for the purchase of a multi-barrier-free facilities for educational centre STUDEO at the Institute of Jedliczka in Prague.
Ticket to the concert is 400 kroons, free for children under 12. Admission tickets can be bought in advance by Bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European space agency Poland was adopted by the member of the European space agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member Esa September 12, 2008).
Poland began working closely with Esa in 1994 and in the years that followed, the active participation in a number of projects of the agency.
But the way to space Poland began much earlier.
Before World War II Polish enthusiasts have been doing to space, but it is not always met with understanding.
Recall, for instance, to lecture a. Ary Abramovich Sternfeld, of which December 6, 1933 were in Warsaw astronomical Observatory of the idea of his pioneering work "Introduction to space."
The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience who, after several years of Ary Abramovich Sternfeld, recalled that only Dr. Kostka Gadomski ján was interested in his work.
Ary Abramovich Sternfeld in France in 1934 won the award of Robert Hesnault - Peltri and Andre Luis Hirsi for "Introduction to space."
Dr. Kostka Gadomski ján (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great advocate of astronomy and space.
He published in the Polish magazines of hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on the scientific disciplines.
Kostka Gadomski became well-known proponent of space exploration, and his contribution was assessed including that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
In 1925, Poland was built railway an inspection, equipped with rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as details of the project.
It was not even clear to crack down or to brake of the truck was meant to be used missiles.
The draisine known only from newspapers of the era.
With 1933 Polish artillery began to worry about the missile missiles.
Research carried out section of weapons technology in cooperation with professors mieczysław Volfka and Gustav Mokzhitskiy.
Of materials research shows that reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops of the work was interrupted.
In 1937 in specialized printing the idea of photovoltaic gbis fighter, which offered an engineer rogozin's atlantist, and next year the work "Air missiles - torpedo and air missiles and bombs" author Lelivy - Kzhivoblotskiy.
Both projects have been developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all projects for military use missile technology was doing temporary scientific advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, performance ended due to the outbreak of war.
The scientific work, devoted to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (polskie towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about the company is mentioned in november number 1954 Journal of "Problem," in which provides four-dimensional article on Astronautics.
In one professor M. Subotovich offered to organize society, which will occupy the space.
At the time, had already gathered pace projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space research is promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Society of Astronautics (Poá) tried to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and the autumn Poá become a full member.
And the following year the first chairman Poá of Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this role, he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
With 1956 Poá made a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful sounding rocket rm (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, the latter scientific research.
The first type rm -1 were completed in 1957, and the first round was held on October 10, 1958.
Missiles able to overcome a distance of 1800 meters, was in length of 80 inches, and her weight was 5 pounds.
Was subsequently built an improved version of rm -1 a, and in the summer of 1959 Bledovskiy compound was carried out on the two-stage rocket rm -2.
The rocket was in length of 1.4 meters, and her weight of about 11.5 pounds.
The next version of the rocket was able to do this research - missile rm -34 to 14.5 km, and her job was overseeing the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962 further development was suspended.
Of the first missiles rm a rocket meteor -1, between 1962 and 1965.
Missiles was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 inches, and initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Was developed type three (designated as a meteor -1 a, -1 B and -1 C), which was organised the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
Missiles a -1 and had space for 0.4 L, a -1 - 0.34 L, and a -1 - 0.62 L.
Maximum range of all three types was 37 km.
In the period between the years 1965 and 1968, the Aviation Institute had the development of missiles a -2, and its first flight test began in October of 1970.
Missiles a -2 from the weight of 380 kg was able to lift cargo weight of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Then built a version of the -2 and a -3.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland in the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, the programme Interkosmos, Poland took part in the research of space on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot mirosław Hermaszewski became the second space after Vladimir Remek.

The abolition of the law on public works - is not a solution.
Last week the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
The decision provoked lively debate in society.
Sure, it will be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal - oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that separate economic unit, national economic system, is in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unfettered flow of private capital along with rampant financial speculation.
As a result of the significant differences in the cost of labor (pay) price tension.
The thing you need to understand the situation, when the manufacturer through the delivery of cheap goods are trying to survive in the economic competition is what "Is" the cost of a competitor in order to get a larger share of the market and, therefore, to increase their own income.
On a massive scale, this means for the majority of employers or shifting production abroad, or low-cost purchases abroad, or disappearance. The result is increased unemployment in those in countries where labor costs, compared with other, high.
As private capital has no social responsibility, including for producing the inevitable unemployment, rising government spending on social needs.
The overall situation amplified by the reluctance of the gentlemen of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby to compensate for the social economic and social damage in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well-known that need no specific statistics.
At his methods of private capital will at the level of individual states, when governments are forced to compete with each other, to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital.
In other words, the government gives its own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected in the first place in the change of the current legislation.
The goal is cost to make his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This act as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serve as an instrument of cutting workers' rights in the sphere of labour legislation.
The result is a higher level of poverty, but also to the difference between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years there is public distribution of food to the poor who can not feed themselves own work.
The number of these people are close to million.
As part of the efforts to increase the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly cases, when employed people receive a salary that the state must say that they received subsistence level.
This scandal, was seen by the public and in case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states, no doubt, leads to the same condition, in which people, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of the social status, are required to emigrate, as it was in the 19 century, or to exist on poverty-level wages on the margins of society, in the hope that some day in the country is going to come from private investment capital.
But the question is, where he will take them?
If capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, an African still works for the European share of wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media were nausea that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital has insisted that the state has managing action to intervene in the economy.
The question to be answered is not whether private capital, is now practically management policy and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?
Clear answer is yes.
The evidence is there almost omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result we have a hopeless situation, revealed in corruption, benefits in the legislation, where virtually all deserve punishment, but is not a crime.
Of the situation is that the State Department because of a lack of funds to the development of bills private law firms, which are closely linked to the industry.
Then these bills argue the Bundestag.
The power comes not from the people, according to the Constitution of the Western-style, but from financial - powerful groups who own interests.
Obviously, the liberal - oriented democracy now quickly find themselves in such a situation, as described Appianom in the works "Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompéia": " The state has long been broken up, and agencies are involved in violence.
Bribes, illegal receiving handouts with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls with pre-sold voice ..." Decent people do not run for governor, and, in the end, once the state for eight months without consul..." "Began to talk seriously about the fact that the only salvation in a terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of finding energetic man..." Appian Pompéia thought it would be, but they became Caesar, who had replaced democracy to autocracy.
As in antiquity, in modern society dominated by its own reckless without taking into account the interests of the public interest.
Private capital has already at its core is not intended to apply to public order.
The result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline of the elite without any efforts to reform a more profound.
The reason why a fascist and Communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19 and 20 centuries.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of the type of liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which is expected to be the next round.
First tragic is that the current elite has ignored consequences in the thousand victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe, which we have already seen, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not for good.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus this trend are systemic.
Solution is to target political and social reforms, which will strengthen the shares of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of state and will weaken the monopoly of private capital in the state.

Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"Of violence will not do, and can never get out" - sting, the song "Fragile," where the main verse of the refrain is a word: "Do not forget what we are really fragile."
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no" - dying goutelle Shnaper, wife meer Amshel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused many of the responses.
One advocate for Israel, arguing his position, that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians in the terrorists' other supports the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the state of Israel, the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who in this periodic waves of murder victim is the criminal, and who, in the end, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territory, was born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed violence.
My goal is to offer readers to look behind the curtain, to take a look at who primarily a 95-year-old tensions (from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November of 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is based on historical facts, some of them out on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of humanity - is the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same or Alexander the Great, Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people themselves take their own steps, or for their throne was someone who sent their actions to advance its goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and their power could not take place for a generation.
Among from astronomically wealthy families are allocated one, which could be regarded as the head of octopus (do not know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - rothschilds.
Many of them do not write.
Of course.
The first News agency (reuters) they bought already in the 90 years of the 19 century, to stop rumors linking their behalf with criminal action in high places, in the shadow of who they were, and which has always led to a strengthening of their power, wealth creation or both, in the way of another.
They are large blocks of shares in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries, whose central banks they do not have a stake, they have been or are preparing war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was 7, after the invasion of Iraq has 5 members, after overthrowing Qaddafi stayed only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the Central Bank of their country into their own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve Central Bank for Rotshildovskiy Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to print their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (federal Reserve), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after like Sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst of world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the establishment of the plan three world wars created great a 33-level Albert solderings.
The objective of the first war was the collapse of the monarchy in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially Britain, and the third will lead to a reduction of the world's population to about 0,5-1 people of (the number of slaves will be enough to provide for them comfort and luxury, and they will not use), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be anything other than a precondition for such project) and the seizure of absolute power.
Method by which a working group of the richest families headed rothchilds, in the face of the crisis and the supply of (ab Chao - order out of chaos).
But these are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (cf. The Fed, which was intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis, resulting in 1907).
Thus, after they have been able to start the first world war, by killing of the Habsburg heir of the Austro - Hungarian throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia, by Bolshevik Revolution.
The first world war ended a sudden, unfounded in military and economic relations surrender of Germany (already there was no need of the war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia), and, as a result, there has been carving up Central European country, Austria - Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany's huge war reparations, than the conditions to radicalization of the impoverished masses, then went on to have the Germans strong, convicting perpetrators and offering simple solution of the leader, to create a multinational czeckoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and indeed played a 5th column, with the fire of war.
In the late 19 century, the Rothschild family has provoked the basis of the Zionist movement, one branch which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area historical Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration set the stage for a massive immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to happen first encounter with local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The outbreak of the second world war, it is difficult to assess, escaped whether Hitler from chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or what he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps set the stage for a recognition of the Jewish state world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was caused by war reparations for the 2 world war, the state of Israel was declared, to create a hotbed of war third.
If international bankers will be able to start, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of the fighting on the front line, now with Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of strife and chaos, not only nationally but internationally (to take only a sharp division of people on both supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is a victim of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because like us, international bankers confronts the people to vote in the elections only their own candidates.
Yastreb Israel's current prime minister, Netanyahu is a typical example of Nazi, loyal international bankers policy, making all, to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to turn into a global conflict, and given control of Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of all of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the world are now being words, by David Rockefeller in 1994: "What we need is a crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their vision is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
The world, where the rest of the human population is a handful of financial aristocracy, coveted comfort.
The world body, where every child born with the implant chip, with whom he is being under total control.
" And makes all large and small, rich and poor, free and slaves to be on the right hand or forehead on a stamp, so that the man, who has not been marked with the name of the Beast, or the number of his name, could not buy or sell.
There is the wisdom: everyone with reason, can calculate the number of the Beast.
For consistent with it the name of human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.

The film "Operation" Argo ": when worse; there is Hollywood
In November of 1979, a crowd of demonstrators Islamist students seized the US Embassy in Tehran and took hostage 52 diplomat.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the Revolution in the United States, which was the patron saint of his regime for decades.
For the US administration the situation was not expected - she could not afford to throw shakh overboard, because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of the allies in other countries.
But to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the Revolution have led to the theocratic regime, she was not in the state.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which later was strengthened by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats was finally released 444 days later, after the talks mediated by the government of Algeria.
Their fate was summoned home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Defeat in Iran to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, repressed actor Ben Affleck "Operation" Argo " Describes one of the episodes of the story, which brought America's small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of the six workers managed to escape.
After serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA in cooperation with the Canadian authorities have managed to take them from Iran, with the help of the extravagant Legends of the cover, according to which they went to Canadian passports as members of the crew, place in the country for this sci - fi epic.
The combination of genres
Plan, which invented an expert on "Evacuation" Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To legend was true, in specialized magazines are writing about a film project, was a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time was kept secret, film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
The film Affleck is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "Movie - movie Opus," the story of a good idea, is an example of what could be a series of films about Ocean's.
The film is constantly changing mood - documented on the one hand, of scenes from Tehran (the credits shown significant historical photographs of events, and the way the situation was demonstrated in the film - a big difference in this).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood mosimage, overlapping with irony and mild exaggeration.
a scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussed the situation in the table of negotiations, on the stairs of the institutions, on the phone...
Ben Affleck is managed to do was restarted his career.
Of being an actor became a respected director, and his game to be an object of ridicule.
"Operation" Argo "His third feature film, after dark detective" gone baby gone thriller " (2007) and" the City " (2010).
But at the same time it is the first film of Affleck, who has not played in the hometown of director - Boston.
The sense of atmosphere of place in this case refers to the qualities that raised earlier films of director on a Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is evident in "Argo," where Tehran "Played" Canada.
The best scene in the film is happening on the streets, in the reconstruction of the real events - opening scene of the drop in the embassy is its clarity, which also convey emotions of confusion and imprévision, which comes when it suddenly change history.
a similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are scenes fictional (fake headquarters in Tehran Bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
Director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a lot of exciting scenes of cinematic value.
He is been working with a little further elaborated, sometimes something - anything that is not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call to America to prevent the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Chase on the runway looks-fetched).
Lack "Argo" is a distraction, based on the need to show too much in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really charming, but their characters would justify more space in the film, and they are not alone.
The film Affleck lacks a bit dramatic, this film, which you can watch with moderate interest, evaluating performances and retro - style thriller set in the Seventies.
But capture with Labour.
However, enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as evidence of how exaggerated view of an omnipotent and omniscient intelligence agencies.

Rules some of the balloons, bananas and circus
Eures www.bankovnipoplatky.com, who each year survey of the most bizarre bank tax, now decided to announce a competition for "The most absurd or project of the studio the EU."
"We have led to the recent events, in which the EU will take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of the major European companies," said "Right" organizer of the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Of those already voted on the nomination of is the recent decision of the European Court of consolidation in the insurance premiums for men and women.
So far women have benefits for life insurance, because insurance companies they really are less at risk.
" Further is an incredible idea from a workshop EU people can advance the contest before the end of the year.
The vote will be held before the end of February of 2013, " Said Nager.
The controversial orders the EU, for example, and mandatory addition of components in the fuel that, as a result of damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury, simply because they are a relatively small number of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the cages for chickens, which this year has risen substantially eggs.
The criticism came under de facto ban on the use of the term "Beachwich oil" or from the sale of classical light bulbs.
Quality bananas must be a length of 14 inches.
European phone often decide under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels is usually defend any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even threatened Veuthey defend the demands of their banks).
Interests lobby is this: for example, bananas, the highest-quality European Union were to reach 14 cm long and did not dare to be "Abnormal curvature."
The European Commission dodged the question, saying that the only harmonise existing disparate national rules, which affect trade.
The EU, in spite of some States, yet softened standards on fruits and vegetables, on the grounds that the existing directive will lead to a waste of products.
Candidate for the poll can be and last year's resolution, according to which the EU's top-selling balloons have to come with warning that children under eight years could not finagle their unattended adults.
The EU turned to American studies, in which the balloons in a game is a potential cause of death for children through suffocation.
Such restrictions now is for children up to 14 years, which is forbidden to go to fairs.
Funny ideas are born and at home.
Is absurd, and the rules for the European officials: anyone who has the EU any official position, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should instead says "FYROM" (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Eures Bankovní poplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "Principle of non-interference" (laissez faire), offered to vote, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, EU rules on the amount of food on the territory of a member state.
The EU imposed the maximum amount of food, which can be located in the Czech Republic on the day of its membership in the European Union.
Later, the Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she was threatened by a heavy fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire also interested in and ideas to pay some countries, for they have no idea of the Sea, and to provide subsidies for the application for a subsidy.
But the idea originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
" We are at a disadvantage, because we do not have sea.
Ask the European Union for compensation ," said the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture yaroslav Palace (cssd).
The argument, he pointed out that the country was a good grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interventional procurement state had a full inventory of stocks, which had to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palace, we were supposed to pay million euros.
In the end the European Commission agreed to the Czech Republic through a tender to supply of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving the subsidies offered to present the Ministry for regional development, led by Minister Pavel Nemec (us-deu), in particular, the subsidies would go to filing a complaint on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU is freakish orders excluding
Although Statutum in member states are easily drawn criticism, EU efforts to regulate, as well as more effective operation and development of the European Union, many experts believe, deserve more recognition.
Serious problem, according to the experts, is the EU of grants for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, however, that Member States have made in the discussion of the budget.
The emotions among Czechs and that, just as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of their traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
While the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians kept the name "Olomoucké syrečky," but "Tuzemskiy Roma," a tradition which in our country has its roots in the 19 century, our producers had to rename the "Tuzemak."
To be called Roma can only products made from cane, not from sugar beet.
The official list of the products of the EU, along with world-famous cheeses of "Feta" and "Gorgonzola," marzipan from German Ljubek or Parma ham, who have already been, for example, karlovy crumbs, police and Karp and Saaz hops.
The trademark EU can be proud of Pardubice carrots and mining romanticism tube.

People want, so I watched Republic, but I am a fan, says Okamura.
Mr Senator, as people come to him to run for the presidency?
I do not think that the risk becoming a senator or president.
If we in the country all operated without problems, I still would not be running.
But I no longer can watch over the last 20 years the country is being stolen, as there tend to thieves, people raise taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be one.
But when you see something that I do not like, you are trying to find a solution, as it is to change.
And since I was forty years old and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I do not have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for senator or president.
In the Senate did you get, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Not turn are you so back to the people who you choose?
I always said that I will fight for the presidential castle, depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.
I later said that if the Senator will be selected, it will be to run for President.
My goal is not to office, Post - it is a tool with which I can understand their views.
So I have the greatest influence and wide powers.
But the difficulty is not so much that we, as a nation, grumbling in the bar or watching TV, but ready to trample on anyone who will try to change something.
The media, which tarnish, and who confuse freedom of speech, freedom of lies.
For example, about me saying that I am giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to the jiří of Paroubek.
Will go to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with statements on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and otherwise declarations of assets worth 20 million or higher.
To do so, we need to change the law.
You as the President did not, and only a Senate may propose laws.
As you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied for ensuring that the operation was free enterprise, it was possible to advance.
The problem is politics - when someone comes in with a good proposal to the left or to the right, he deliberately obstructed, which discourages citizens.
As an independent, non-partisan man I have a huge potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party arrangement went on to explain, without looking at the dogmas can take each party, and what is best for our country, and to apply it.
Are you a people, more relevant to the right or the left?
With Czech point of view it seems to me that my people more related to the left.
For me do not matter a bit to the left or to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
, it is not that someone is about right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
Yavsegda will support any good for society, will offer its hrcm or group, and I will still be against bad idea.
You are angry, when someone says you populist.
But did not prove whether you are what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some kind of ideal targets and views.
What you are trying to get closer.
You can call it populism, but all offer, I am talking about is already operational in the world, or said about them prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament leaves just slogans.
And with that in politics you can not long endure.
Or do you think that when you go out to the people and talk with them, you will be able to carry out criminal and liability?
I have no other choice.
Only to persuade politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on their side, that we are successful.
If I was elected president, it would not be a problem to organize direct television broadcast, in which I refer to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And, in the case of failure, will have to explain why do not want it.
If will be a strong personality, which makes the abuses, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct election of the president - it was the merit of the pressure of public opinion.
Speak up and say that I am a fan, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies, to assert their beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and the program will try to get the support of the majority.
The point I am trying to promote themselves, and in case it fails, it will take six years to complete and will return to the private sector.
This is partly because, as if the credits to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I will do nothing, so I went to a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused due to the volume of work.
I at least supported leading investigative journalist ján Lorentsov fraud, which opened with a light fuel oil.
I ran because people and was never satisfied, but now I feel at stake.
sixty percent of the people do not bother to vote, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
We are an independent in the Senate only two.
People chose the Senate so that changes will be made to work.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about your own party?
I have not thought about it, because I do not have the time to check the cleanliness past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money to do so.
No money and on the presidential campaign, in my transparent account only 20 thousand kronor.
You do not have the money?
Youspeaking financial disclosure, and how has your own business with it?
Personal wealth is estimated at about 60 million.
I have done in Prague cost about 25 million in 10 million, another apartment on 8 million, a collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston - Martin on 3500 thousand, and Skoda Superb on million, and several million in the account.
The Aston - Martin, I have, because it was my first dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, were Gallant, a charmer with women, and, at the same time, fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You travel to Aston - Martin, owns property in 60 million and you do not have money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change their own money, but particularly in this is to invest not want.
It is not very convincing.
I do not have 15-million on the campaign.
I should get into debt?
The campaign I have already invested 2500 thousand.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of pocket.
Campaign costs me essentially will cover senatorial salary.
But this money I would not have survived, for example, would not be able to pay the son of an English, which is 30 thousand per month.
If I wanted to make money, so they would not be running.
So, as you will be doing business, in order to live?
Do not you said that will reduce these activities?
But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck.
As I promised her I partially diminished.
For example, managing director of travel agency in spring will be my deputy.
People would like that I was his, which will keep the Republic.
But I also need to do something for a living.
But, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive a monthly basis?
From two centuries before the thousand that are further.
And if I became president, then their business over.
The full interview will find in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "Right."

Architects mvrdv argue that this action is not only in the imagination - for example Spijkenisse and his nylig knizhnoe mountains - 2 Photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, finally, we again you can see something interesting," says Lisette Verkhayg, passers-by to the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermony, an expert on it at the nearby large enterprises, consider this: "No, it is really beautiful."
But I wonder why we are still one shop?
All Internet, the iPad and electronic book.
It is now accepted voluntarily do not go to such old-fashioned library, right?
Spijkenisse, outstanding a town near Rotterdam, is a unusual record.
Its population of 80.000 is the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the education and to build seven fictional bridges, as evidenced by the euro notes, as richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of these educational initiative was modest.
And then the town fathers understood that they remained the only way to beat the statistics: to build a library!
Blame Maas of Rotterdam architectural mvrdv, master of bold bar charts and witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, toward the task with his usual calm and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the jurors looked puzzled look back and shoulders, audacious Maas from its original gift Pyraminx in size and completed a speech in favor of the project following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here is my suggestion: "The Mountain" in Spijkenisse, so-called Bukenberg!
nine years of these mountains grew at a rate of 30 million euros.
It is part of a project of revitalization, which also includes underground garage, supermarkets, and several adjacent houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, "The Mountain" was marked by the second prize in the "Best libraries of the Netherlands 2012."
The project involved in the Dutch national contest of wooden buildings 2012.
Thus, faceless suburb, all of which could not offer anything more than postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly ratusha, white facades which brings to mind the milk, has become richer for a modern works of architecture.
But just a first in the history of this town of Spijkenisse public buildings of cultural destination.
The long road to book
The first impression: knizhnoe geldoradog under the cap for cheese.
Here only one elevator, held in the centre of the, for the fans and the reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Glass from all sides room is light and easily foreseeable, these bricks and elegant street lamps accurately creating a sense of public urban area.
Urban environment was perfect.
Eye on the bench, search dogs and playing football for boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves on the facades, and in the middle is located in a large, darkened, usually a comfortless and faceless," says you should blame the Maas.
We put a classic configuration of space on its head and pulled the zone read from the inside out.
Internal space knizhnoe mountains used skillfully: in downtown offices, Internet Library, chess club, environmental centre and technical facilities.
Particularly pleased black bookcases, which serves as the Wall, the, the stair railings.
Their form, texture and smell is unusual.
Even experienced architects and engineers roadway, ' what is the unknown material.
"We tried to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trauborst, the project manager of the community Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the Standard.
And once at one agricultural enterprises in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of Agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields lining in the Netherlands as the roots are subject to an artificial fibres of a millimeter thick.
It is cheap and save time.
Fine textiles an one - two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the Library of the painting - for the first time in this volume - was in the thickness of four inch.
From the heat and pressure so-called (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, solid material, the smell is a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
At the top are 105 steps.
Those who will go almost 500 meters in length, will be rewarded in literary cafes not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquette and Wood Ficidae in pots.
They are concerned about the atmosphere, and particularly on the right moisture in the air on literary grief.
New soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, was a model project in terms of the environment," says Trouborst.
For heating and cooling is used by the warmth of the Earth.
Although the mountains are under the cap, even on clear days the sun hits in only briefly.
a farm of laminated timber, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and accept most of the sunlight.
Air quality is very pleasant.
The rest of protection provides fully automatic roll curtains.
Stephane of Spermony, cited above skeptic of hi-tech, has already visited New Library.
Lisette Verkhayg also have been here before.
As well as acting coach of traditional Chinese medicine cynthiya Bogarde, who called Bukenberg "Soul Spijkenisse, which has long lacked."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening each resident received an invitation to sacrifice one book from its own collection.
This book was to take place on an empty shelves are not yet fully featured Library - at the time it was the 70.000 books.
The idea worked.
Shelves full of ground up.
"There is nothing worse than half-empty library," says architect blame Maas.
" I think that, thanks to our invitation now each resident in some way connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is just for decoration.
Thus, mvrdv managed to cope with the Royal task, which in a professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And they are very young and too uneducated.
It is only the starting point for the construction of identity.

Szabo: "Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained from the vote on recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: in the week the German first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin have abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of Israelis in Gaza.
Now Germany have to be cautious in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I think that the American position, it also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March of 2011, Germany also abstained on the no-fly zones.
In the end, NATO held the proposal.
Germany is difficult to have a clear position on the complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The matter is, it is in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely pass from politicians, so to speak, by the us, of the German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have agreed a common policy.
Thus, the Germans again is between two fronts.
From them, they are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.
I believe that the only fumble, but are on the path to "More normal" foreign policy.
The foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain.
What exactly is "Normal" foreign policy with a German point of view?
This willingness to play in national position, not dependent on the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and connections with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are very different from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Did this economic interests in position in the Middle East conflict and to vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico.
So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in Arab countries.
In any case it plays a role.
But I would not take it too much, it is not completely one-way communication.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans.
Harmed if Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining when important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States' understanding of the German position.
So I do not think it was the same dramatic trauma, as in Libya's question.
Perhaps Germaniyadazh will acquire thus a certain respect.
It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that with its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, had made it clear veto.
Are differences of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
In American domestic politics of these differences was always there.
I believe that the Obama administration in the back, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But with the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly to take that position.
I believe that serious differences of opinion is not as significant as it always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will see that Obama is not happy about the policy of the Netanyahu.
Is it easy for Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and an important partner in the EU and other?
I think that is what makes this very difficult situation for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not.
So they can not do this as part of a broader approach and is forced instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
They do with the euro.
I think that, in the future, Germany will assume a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany, this is difficult, if only because of their links with Israel.
This issue has always been sensitive.
But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as a major international player - will not take if it is really the main role?
Or leading role remains an uphill battle Germany?
Germany are not used to it, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, is still always gives a significant role to play.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany take on an important role is different donavan feelings.
The Germans are not just to deal with it.
In fact, it is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view of Germany is in much worse shape than the us.
It should take account of the different neighbors and opinion, and it is not easy.
So, us influence in European politics permanently weaken, but at the moment the EU do not fill this vacuum, then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a greater role.
Even if you do not like, unpleasant, or increasing enmity to you - that is life!
Stephen Szabo - deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy Institute in Washington, in which academics and political experts from Europe and North America jointly explore the issue of transatlantic community.
Moreover, Szabo, a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he specializes in German politics, us foreign policy and transatlantic relations.

"Protection of trademarks" in China: when Puma and Armani will suddenly become a Chinese
Armani - world-famous brands, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
But that Armani Polo?
It is officially registered in China's name, which has nothing to do with the firms, from names which it was founded.
Nevertheless it will be protected until the owners of the names will not file suit.
But then it is not clear, and whether they will defend their rights.
"Foreigners are increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattlokh, a lawyer for the company, Taylor Wessing, specializing in the trademark rights violations in the Far East.
On the table every week appear on a new case of this kind.
Imitators to add a couple of letters to achieve the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci to receive Lu-instead of Gucci, Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
The same way legally copied by a German company, for example, the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattlokh open the folder with records for the registration of trademarks in Beijing.
September 14, 2010 Chinese companies have registered trademark there zegna samsen Puma, artificial name, in which used the name fashion houses Ermenegildo zegna.
That the Chinese are champions of the world and the violation of intellectual property rights, known.
There are large department stores, which sells almost exclusively a fake.
But matters Pattlokh not like... On behalf of its clients he was opposed to Chinese companies is officially received from the registration of a trademark right to use the name, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "Ban Pollock," Mark - passenger.
This word is associated with "Ban of nowhere."
Called the women, who are hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize a wine
"It hurt business, must be reduced," says Pattlokh.
"Brands have been diluted, a unique position is image suffered tremendously."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries million, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the company by market research firm clsa, China, with sales of 15 billion euros a year, the third-largest and most rapidly growing market for luxury goods.
But to achieve removal of the controversial in of the trademarks is difficult, and it it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattlokh talks about cases in which the court rejected claims, because after long opposed the name was a "Reality of the market."
If the claimant is lucky, he will have to pay a plagiarist, as damaged his trademark in China, says Pattlokh.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
There are also in the case of graphics.
In 2009, Daimler lost the legal dispute with the manufacturer of construction vehicles Sany, the company, which acquired shortly before the manufacturer of transportations by concrete pumps putzmeister.
So they still have the right to use the emblem, like a star Mercedes.
Bought Volvo by Geely use a Blue - and-white logo, like the BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion in China at the shirts from Hong Kong and Singapore, which famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.
The registration of trademarks CTMO in Beijing confirmed that in 2010, because of staff shortages and outfitting there have been problems.
But last year was "Returning from emergency situation in the workplace to normal."
, the number of cases of objections has decreased by 22 percent.
It was almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for production in office.
To fight this expensive
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year in CTMO had received more than 1400 thousand applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record, and means that China for 10th consecutive years, led the list of new registrations in the world, according to agencies.
The same is true of the total number of valid trademarks, all 5500 thousand of them.
In 2011 it paid 1800 million yuan of fees.
To simplify, this means that each there are on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To contest it is many times that, as a matter of fact, the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the fight against Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans have managed to ensure that illegal manufacture them fake auto parts were.
But copycat has cemented its right to Chinese trademark Freudenberg.
It was their own fault, as the name in Germany are not subject to protection, said Hanno of Venttslery, chairman of the board Freudenberg chemical specialities in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks CTMO rejected claims of.
However, in both the authorities Freudenberg won, but the different factions continue their struggle until now.
We need to be vigilant
The issue is considered by the Supreme Court.
Venttslery hopes to bring the case to a good outcome and praising the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "The extremely expensive and takes our time, money and nerves."
Internal costs it is difficult to track, the archive of the firm had to see even acts one hundred years ago, to give evidence.
five years ago Freudenberg in vain suggested that the other side "Big-digit amount in euro" for the settlement.
"This makes it clear how much that we are," says Venttslery.
The danger of the Far East threatens to spread even in Europe.
In the case, if at the register in the unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The long ago ceased production in these areas, but it is been able to prevent the registration.
"We need to be vigilant," says Venttslery.
As he and his lawyer Pattlokh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on the international situation on the protection of trademarks, most likely aliens were "All that any way is to protect, to register in China," says Venttslery.
Otherwise it might be more costly than registration.
Indeed: if Freudenberg will lose in the last act of his drama about trademark, the other side will be asked to pay licensing fees for its own name, explains Venttslery.
Otherwise we would go out in controversial segment.

World Aids: to, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg rehearsing choir Imbongi - and in Swaziland of AIDS orphan celebrate that.
The history of relations, who overcame more than 8733 kilometers away.
First razdavaysya: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, black pumps and drop your slippers find a bar on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
Times - two - three - four.
Only then slowly rising singers Alta, Bass, tenor and soprano they are, and follow each other.
And Fita Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, just do not go out of their cloth shoes, when lead them flexible and expressive gestures.
The evening of Monday, in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology at Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearsing new song.
The rehearsal there were fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in human genetics to a concierge.
"Om" Aubagne " There is a huge thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, in addition to a foreign language: Zulu, on 11 million in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of the Swaziland.
Help for self-help
, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to fight Aids, there are about 34 million HIV - infected.
23,500 thousand of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 orphans of AIDS.
The more than 40 percent of the population is HIV - positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village Esitzheni Union voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them in school, preparing for further training.
15 or 20 euros a month is to take over the job.
It will guarantee child money on schools, school uniforms, and daily hot lunch at the Museum Center.
Imbongi on Zulu language means narrator or praise.
In this room do not speak briefly on the Bantu, but can sing.
Almost ten years the choir learn to play a song on this strange mild language and occasionally even bring them back to where they first appeared: in South Africa.
For years at a distance of 8733 kilometres from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village Esitzheni, which depend on the votes of the German choir.
Infected forty percent
There are about 2000 people, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus emberger.
In Esitzheni in miniature reflects disease of Swaziland: higher level of HIV infection, the world's lowest life expectancy, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision for men, which proved reduce the risk of infection, among a population of nearly half had not been made.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland is in itself the human immunodeficiency virus, the death of the mid-fourth of the dozen not uncommon.
Choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before participants Imbogni saw a lot of kids on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but also of all: food, clothing, education.
Without the people in poor countries no chances.
At first it was a private commitments of the individual members of a few euros a year to send a child to school and to give them every day to get hot food.
But a year later the choir founded the Union "Voices for Africa," which has almost professional care for orphans of AIDS in Esitzheni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What is the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
To bacterial infections include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea ().
Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
The pubic lice and scabies treat parasitic infections.
What are the main design group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Institute of Robert Koch believes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, is the result of transmission between men.
The heterosexual adults common sexually transmitted diseases, is a chlamydia infection, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and the human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are concentrated in this group.
Among young people of a chlamydia infection occurs significantly more likely than other groups.
The European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We also among young people often meet human papilloma virus.
How the number of cases of infection?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis, according to the Institute of Robert Koch, more than doubled from 1697 in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new infections with the 2007 decline.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
It is about one-10th less than in the previous year.
The symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
In infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints with urination, a pain in the abdomen, as well as bubbles or seal.
But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and goes unnoticed.
How you can protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but it does not provide absolute protection.
The partially agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be spread by contact with infection and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular screening, especially when the frequent changes of sexual partners.
In early detection can cure most gulnara and avoid distant consequences.
The job, donations and last but not least, the fees for the performance of the choir Germany allows something to collect.
"We sent in Esitzheni for about 200,000 euros" says Anneta Lennartts, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany manage Tsodva Dlamini, informed and active woman.
She cares about ensuring that orphans were well-made, for example of one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they are called in the Zulu old women, it is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to yourself to 14 orphans, gives them a roof over his head and take care of the children in the form of every day in time to appear at the lessons.
Those who have not left his native, is in an orphanage to Khaniysila, a lonely woman, receiving a salary from the merger, as well as two cooks, which every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Moreover, the "Voices for Africa" organized sewing school, built two chicken coop and together with American health Organization Psi wasog Braviaѕ of HIV test for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so evident throughout the country, prefer to remain silent.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Anneta Lennartts, "Because he is linked to sexuality."
Quite unusual in a country where King officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on a state-sanctioned style of life also share the blame for the fact that the virus emberger so quickly spread in the past years.
But she is also on the circus workers, which carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms have literally on every corner, says Anneta Lennartts, " But almost never use.
Other crops - flesh to flesh. "
Slightly to support cultural exchanges, choir Ibmogni every two to three years is traveling in South Africa and pesni, full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern edge of the continent know since the days of apartheid.
Bus full of White, who pesni the black-language - such recognition not only a good mood and joy, but even happened, I have tears in the eyes of the rugged border guards.
Trip is also leads in Esitzheni, where singers visit to the children.
Despite the fact that a small village with Labour can be found on the map, in Glen Etsulvenya more than known.
"Idi in Esitzheni, where light" the people here.
And after the 8733-kilometer-long flight back in Heidelberg, when singers get back in the rehearsal room on the streets Bergkhaymer, you can see that the light is also here.

Messenger: we open ice at Mercury
Probe "Communicator" found evidence that the planet Mercury is ice.
The ice could have a thickness of 20 meters.
Space Department of us have proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it is also frozen water, according to a three study published Thursday in the journal Science special.
Probe "Communicator" found evidence that are always in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered by ice.
It measures must be at least 30 inches, and perhaps even to 20 meters.
Presumably, water is a comet or asteroid, perhaps, faced with the Mercury.
No one connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said finsler probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature at Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But the finding could help explain, as water and other building blocks of life are in other places of the solar system.
Out to the citizens of the land probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix" explore the depth of the universe.
From time to time they send in the land of images: small screens in endless gave.
Image comes with the camera, which developed by the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
eight planets in our solar system, and dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, a new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006, is not a "Planet."
This fragment infrared images of the Telescope "Spitzer" is "Family portrait of" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of the blue, the more difficult to identify the celebrity circle pink "Newborn" star.
This region of Starburst region - scientist call it W5, the telescope "Spitzer" in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
The iridescent glow of a dying star photographed Telescopii of us, "Spitzer."
The doughnut rings consist of material, which stars out in the process of dying.
In a giant nebul Trifid, located some 5400 light years from Earth, of gas and dust a new star.
Telescopii of us, "Spitzer" made these photographs of the Galactic maternity facilities.
Pleiades star cluster, also known as the "seven sisters" at night, you can see with the naked eye.
Of course, with the scope of the colors are better.
As Red eye winks at Helix Nebula Observer on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Resemblance to the continent has brought this nebul nickname "North America."
Kombinaciya normal and infrared photography provides vivid color.
This new star in the whole beauty was able to photograph only by means of infrared sensors Telescopii "Spitzer."
Saturn and its rings: as they emerged from one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
It is, perhaps, the pieces of the moon of Saturn, who disappeared 4500 million years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest picture of the Telescope "Hubble": Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color of the pictures of spiral galaxies turns into works of art.
By the European Southern Observatory of the picture shows a remote Trifid a few thousand light-years from Earth in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word Trifid (trisulca, buergerianum), as dark stripe dust divided into three parts of the parched heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation Ophiuchus astronomers photographed a harbinger of cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth's core two merging galaxies rushing towards each other and will inevitably face.
It is the birth of stars Telescopii "Hubble" in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical reduction, may call it as "Southern Tsevochnyy wheel."
Photographs of the space telescope "Hubble" shows a fragment of Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
Nebul, located some 1400 light-years, consists of dust particles that are ten to one hundred times less than the usual dust.
The picture was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a band of black holes, located some 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed for us space Telescope "Hubble."
Large spiral galaxy scientists call was ugc 1810.
In this star nebul is the most prominent group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle is constantly creating new star.
This stellar clouds, combined with nebul sockets, also creates a new star at a distance of 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a black hole there is no dust, gas.
The researchers suggest that she emerged shortly before the big Bang, when the universe was mainly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably Telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Hans Lippershey, even before Galileo Galilei year later started to watch the stars.
Since then, the Mirror of optical telescopes have become more accessible - and their view of space deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Telescope "Khala" in the Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
Mirror, represented here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, a "Large Binocular Telescope."
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
"Grand Prix Teleskopio Canarias" has a huge internal device - diameter only mirror up to 10.4 metres.
Zerkalo "Big South African Telescopii" in South Africa divided - to reduce the cost.
Nevertheless in diameter, it is about eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: Telescopii firmly cemented the vertical angle is limited his mobility.
Telescopii "Hobby - Eberly" in Texas also have a fixed vertical angle.
The features: high-collecting capability.
It is - despite a relatively small diameter mirror - parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers listening to the extraterrestrial signals into space.
Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In a project "The search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (Seti), anybody with a computer can help, leaving its computing power.
an European Observatory of astronomical Service (eso) in the Chilean Andes.
There is "a very large Telescope" - worthy of the name.
His four zerkalo allows in the Spyglass even mid-infrared spectrum.
In the Chilean Observatory also planning to install the "a Large Telescope."
Its main mirror should be spread by as much as 42 feet - and will be made up of nearly 1000 mirrored elements.
But photographs should not expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Telescopii "Kyōka" in Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea was the largest in the world.
In these two mirror diameter of ten meters.
Telescopes "Kyōka" is part of the Mauna Kea, which, together with them looking at the Sky also with the "Subaru" and IRTTF.
Moreover, on Mauna Kea there will also be a new giant telescope with a mirror with a diameter of thirty metres.
Here to admire the illustrations.
But the most important species from outer space available space Telescope "Hubble."
Since April 24, 1990, he delivered a picture of a distant worlds.
With March of 2009 space Telescope "Kepler" looking for planets outside the solar system - specifically, on which there was life.
February 2, 2011 we reported that 1235 planet candidates have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The picture was the last of the space Telescope "Kepler."
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space until 2018, aboard the rocket Ariane "5."
The reflection of infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the objectives of the telescope: he should light of the first stars and galaxies to look for a big explosion.
The scientists suggest that to the Mercury is ice.
But reliable data on this, because "Communicator" rotates closer to the North pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades, pointed out that the Mercury is ice.
Thanks to probe launched in 2004 "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists are now sure.

In southern Azerbaijan many residents reaches a biblically old age.

The search for clues in the country, where 97-year-old startsev seems still relatively young.
Trip through talysh mountains can be called wild and romantic.
Minibus with the rumble is rolling on the trip by a dense forests of the mountains, turbulent streams and simple peasant houses.
Marlowe so Sehlen and bright that make you think they are in Glacier.
But it is the southern edge of Azerbaijan, Iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
Talyshs live here is one of the nations of the Caucasus, which is known for being a little bit, but only full well what they say in Farsi and azerbaijani and longevity.
The final item is the Lerik.
Small town to tout too heavy architecture of the Soviet Union, which is not well with the picturesque landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost did not come here, the road from the capital, Baku too comfortable.
The 323 kilometer uhodite eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
Legendary wealth, which countries have oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not been reached.
But pilata of zahidov (48), I am sure that in Lerik have something to attract tourists.
"In may, Baku is a Festival of Song Contest - and next year will see the Festival of the oldest people of the world," said zahidov.
She is director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
It documented biography about eight dozen talyshs of these places, which more than 100 years of zahidov point to the black - and-white photography.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But controversial star of the Museum is Shepherd Kangarli of Myuslyumov, who allegedly was 168 years old.
Birth, however, is not.
And because the oldest man, whose age documented, was 122 years old, the age of the Myuslyumov is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," explains zahidov.
He was married three times, and he had 23 children, aged 136, he allegedly gave birth to a daughter.
It added Lee Shepherd of Myuslyumov of a couple of dozen years to their age?
Even Rembrandt scholze, a researcher of the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of veterans in Central Asia.
"a surprising number of elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, Japan or in the Valley hunza in Pakistan," says Scholz, "On Sardinia also live has a lot of very old people."
But in the absence of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, because it has not been a list of civil status.
Every day a glass of clarified butter
But there is the fact that people in the area of Lerik surprisingly often reaches the age.
Today, there are 20 people over 100 years old.
Why here, to the south, as many veterans?
Azerbaijani guide farida Mugimzad explain this particular genes talyshs.
The director of the Museum of zahidov, by contrast, believe that the real food.
Talyshs love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them to drink a glass of clarified butter every day. But it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy with comprehensive point of view.
Or in some way of life, which keeps people young in Chengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, live Rubaba mirzoev.
In 97, she still relatively young for this area.
Well, who argue that her 143 offspring, live in simple wooden home, a typical for the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly go back and forth.
Here under one roof eight people, including one of the sons and daughters, who had long ago have their grandchildren.
The area's two children.
The kitchen guests prepare tea, which is served in a typical pot-bellied glasses Armada.
We had a smooth and strong teeth, under a headscarf she hides a long dark blond braids, which her son with pride before us.
I always my hair milk, so they never came, and maintain their color.
"And I would never used shampoo," says theologian.
Monthly pensions enough for life
She always ate only that grew up in their own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, Peas.
For all my life I have never bought products in the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the Army.
Harder after World War II.
But is better, when "Beloved father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often in the speech of the old woman.
But cult created about the father of the nation, which ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son ilham.
Nevertheless among azerbaijani starikov no poverty.
230 manats (about the same as the same amount of euros) - will receive monthly pensions, as the local conditions for this amount, which is possible to live.
And, perhaps, have long grown son had also right: "Old people in our culture has become a."

The word "Human right" is not mentioned in the Constitution
Revolution was back in Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo is evidence of a deep split in the country.
The future Constitution, based on Sharia, met fierce fighting back.
The Egyptian president also had pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And its success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to all the people, but, first of all, to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslim and secular Egyptians.
For all of them, still hopelessly divided in an affidavit opposition fear.
Fear of religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful "Muslim Brothers."
Mohammed Morsi, with open to tourists, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and has expanded its competence, "To save the revolution."
But what really want to save the 61-year-old engineer with the degree of Doctor of the American University of Southern California, it is not the Egyptians and the world.
Will be deprived of force by judicial power?
In fact 234 article has managed to bring in a 15-hour horse racing with obstacles in former anti-constitutional assembly of 100 members, and it is partly a cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the procedure is based on "The principles of Islamic law."
But that means "Principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and the fear that Islamists will use vague formulations arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least on this suggest a new article: in all cases where Sharia, should be used to board the University of al - Achard, the main Islamic institution of the country, with great authority across the Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy oversight of the legislation, the de facto would effect the limitations of judicial power.
In the draft deal is subject to interpretation
Another problem: the need to retain jurisdiction of civilians by military courts.
The courts during the rule of Mubarak for the suppression of the opposition.
After the overthrow of dictator in military detention was up to 11.000 civilians.
Also, as expressed in the draft, the state should protect "The true nature of the Egyptian family" and "To support its morals and values."
Are formulated so fuzzy, that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control content even film and literature.
Open text this means nothing other than censorship.
Indeed a single article does not set right the equality of men and women.
But other prohibited to offend and defame the Prophet Muhammad, and that his envoys.
But what, and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
It is also questionable language that banned "Defamation of people."
Enough to be a caricature of a president or a joke about legal?
Question of interpretation, like so much in this project, which Morsi a signature and that, in his words, "Very soon" Egyptians will be submitted to a referendum.
"Revolution returned"
The past few weeks is formed opposition against the Islamists.
Thousand people gathered in a unusual unanimity Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document, even before he will be able to enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we will win," said Khamdin Sabbakhi, the third-place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic energy agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, said that the draft Constitution place "To the dustbin of history."
, via a short news Twitter followers he accused Morsi's desire to lead a "Coup against democracy."
"If he would announce a referendum, we will go to the Palace and will take his" said opposition politician Yasser said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers are not" - quoted Egyptian media of the opposition politician, Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they do not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
Well-organized "Muslim Brothers," in turn, called for other demonstrations, but the precaution of, not in Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer, on the other side of the Nile to Cairo University.
The large number of women under the covers and adherents of the Salafis, who shouted: "People requires of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "Ochisti country!" and said: "The Koran is our Constitution."
The struggle for power in the largely symbolic Square, where it all began, has provoked a state of virtual civil war.
Followers, Morsi, clearly, did not want to take the risk.
"Brotherhood," said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution has spoken loud and clear.
Now it is time to give the people to decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Most for the project of the Islamists, it is considered solved the case.
"The concept of" human rights "There is no mention of any"
Hafiz Abu Syed goeb from this forced the constitutional process, but one that was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (YeOPRY) defended the "Muslim Brothers," when Mubarak sat in jail or stand trial.
Not because he shared their views, but because human rights for him is indivisible.
He was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the word of "Human rights" did not meet the new Constitution, sorry he is in an interview with the "Welt am sonntag."
Morsi's expanding influence on all three branches of state is just a lawyer.
These measures represent a clear attack on democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Rather than to strengthen civil state, President de facto annulled his" - sorry Syed.
Without civil society organizations democracy can not function.
Syed feel that left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
For this may be a reckoning.
Demonstrators in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster, which will not be able to control."

Take somewhat overdue pieces of cheese.

Around snow-love. It is very nice, but quantity of hard.
Rakfisk is trout, sprinkled with Salt and circulating in water up to a year, depending on what cool must be achieved.

"It is raw and with a glass of Aquavit, local vodka," explains Havard, Khalvarsen, the local fire by profession and "General," who runs the Festival.
People all around us there is a small cubes fish and with its considerable amounts of alcohol.
"Someone like Aquavit, than iskra Havard," says.
This drink is to smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
Will Yesliudat' to smuggle a piece under his nose, then it is not so bad - is not much different than serving sushi, which you long drive back to the bus.
Rakfisk is Norwegian product of a different era, the Times of poverty, when, before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn in a sealed barrels with salty water.
Then deep in winter, when the fish are already well and, her removed and, perception of alcohol, used in food.
At the memory of the past generation, the fact that the thousand Norwegians have been forced to flee their country in search of work and to emigrate, mostly in the United States.
Now, a rapidly growing population - more than 13% of the immigrants, who is here jobs, higher wages and developed the social security system.
The people of Sweden (long-time rival, and it was not so long ago and far more affluent neighbor) Mass come here to work.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, a foul-smelling, albeit somewhat last element of Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, it is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($ 14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and the majority of the country's population, it is fine.
The people here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, racist and extremist right-wing, who last year and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, one called "The events of July 22."
Nordafjells very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens were capable of such atrocities and murder.
The basis of today's well-being of Norway is the (since the early Seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, the trays with a spark, a woman with long blond hair and blue eyes, is the embodiment of Nordic welfare.
We are a people - if you call - rational.
As the majority of Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We do not like to expose may be boastfully, we do not.
Norway very carefully treat its oil - greater share of the oil and gas industry is invested in special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when all money, which they did not have, Norway, employee was calculating all costs.
"As long as you can go skiing in winter and summer to go hiking, enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there is a spark" she added with a carefree laughter.
I am standing in the snow in the queue for any food - iskra enough is enough.
That is burgers with Elk meat is certainly something exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But tonight we will see more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel holds a special dinner, dedicated to spark, in which visitors vote will determine the best, or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
Direct television shows, in which leading to the bow - tie, surrounded by plates with spark.
It is like the Eurovision Song Contest " ."
"So, Tor - Jürgen, the assessment you have made the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard,, here is our assessment..."
All laughs and applause.
Someone fall from the chair, perhaps, was Prett Aquavit.
Or maybe just the smell of the fish.

He is faced with a difficult task.
Mexico achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which is now taking shape their powers, but the country is buried in the war on drugs, for six years, has claimed about 60.000 lives.
"My government says the people of Mexico is ready to fight violence," said earlier this week Mr. Peña Nieto US President Barack Obama in the White House Oval Office.
I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
To such statements next to the US president of the political career of Mr. Peña Nieto has evolved as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in densely populated and extensive state, the capital of the country, the opinion of a new leader is divided.
Straightforward man
In an idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered.
Residents puts him the revival of tourism, the development of resort industry and infrastructure.
You can reach the City as part of the New highway, built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a far cry from the roads with potholes and bumps, which earlier this place.
The plate with his name on the modern building of the Sports Center and the impressive interactive museum devoted to climate change.
"We associate with him hope for a real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Hernandez, Olvera state representative from led by Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect this and decisive change, which is so badly needed in our country, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 consecutive years in power, Party the PRI was ousted in 2000, Fox.
Congressman Olvera admit that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace Los Pinos Party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
Moreover, he denied the charges in the emptiness, which launched a new president, opposition.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision for the country's future.
This great statesman, and, above all, a man who can listen to.
But in other parts of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor.
, also known as the municipality of Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl was a marked contrast to the cobbled streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under flyovers of highways in many ways, he is a suburb of the Mexico City.
And problems in the municipality also be harsh nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year for the pacification of gangs, drug-trafficking in these areas, were engaged troops; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
On a vacant lot near the vast landfill in the last two years alone, was found dozens of bodies of the slain women.
More than thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico during the government of Mr Peña Nieto is much higher than similar measure in the notorious for violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become generic, when it comes to killing of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto about it in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as governor he was not able to cope with the problem of the murder of women.
In the worst case, his administration accuses in complete disregard of the problem.

Official version Mariana in 2010 committed suicide.
But her family thinks that she killed her life partner.
"When I came to her home, it seemed that her body before that washed," says Ms Buendiya.
There were signs that she was beaten, and body had became benumbed.
The mother of the Mariana retell the story, and a portrait of his daughter is looking at us with the walls, where he hangs next to a crucifix, on which is inscribed one word: Justice.
This, they said, was denied the family.
" Officials of the state turned to me with old gossip girl, disaffected of calm.
They want people to simply take the faith of all that, they say, and why.
But it is wrong, and you can, especially when there are so many irregularities and errors ," she said.
Wearing a presidential sash on Saturday, President of Peña Nieto with it will take a heavy responsibility.
Over the last six years the thousand families in Mexico affected the crime of violence, and the new president promised to make the issue a priority during his presidency.
"I hope that he will be the same president, what was the governor," says Olvera, a congressman from the Valle de Bravo PRI.
But it is the most feared the victims' families in Ciudad bear.

Cross-examination in the framework of the review of the defence request to dismiss Manning, on the grounds that the terms of his sentence was cruel and itself was sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning said that while in detention, he intended to commit suicide.
Military specialist intelligence analysis, arrested in June of 2010, accused of the abduction of the thousand secret documents while serving in Iraq.
They were subsequently published on the website WikiLeaks.
Site WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of the information was Manning.
During a hearing on Friday prosecutors with Manning looked at reports, which was filed after visits Manning administration officials during his years in prison Kvantiko, where he was on a strict regime of conclusion from July of 2010 to April of 2011.
During visits to the prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded the answers.
When prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about reports, Manning acknowledged that evaluate treatment to himself from the administration of the prison as "Excellent," and the conditions of confinement as "Very professionally organized."
Examined reports do not contain allegations of mistreatment, despite the fact that Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, said Sinn Fein.
Manning replied that he expressed verbal concern about these problems and that members of his administration officials discussed with him the problem and said that they will do, but not fix it in writing.
"They recorded" problem " (after discussion of my complaints), but that does not mean that I have not raised the issue in talks," says Manning.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning, he complained of abuse to him in January of 2011 during the session of the Commission, who viewed the suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning said that at the time of the meeting he wanted to ensure that it was stripped of the regime of "Prevention of injury" and softened conditions of detention.
The military leadership explained that limited the regime of detention - level lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect prisoners, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to give to know administration, that to me all right, that they end the regime of preventing injury... That my life has improved, from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months, before they were transferred to a prison at the naval base in Kvantiko,, in July of 2010.
He said, that the thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he fainted because of the heat.
He explained, because it is very difficult when you can not even know how to decide your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
" My world shrank to base camp Arifzhan, to the size of my prison, said Manning on Thursday.
- I thought I would die in these cells ."
In Kvantiko, Manning, he said, much of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, or even more than 23 hours - in solitude.
Manning said, that he had been allowed to leave only a mattress, blankets, slippers, a few items of clothing and sunglasses.

According to Manning, while asleep in his eyes, he is beaten with a light, which outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face, when he turned over in bed at night, he said, his budili and forced to turn over on his back.

My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of a lack of opportunities to achieve.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind the country's residents about the difficult times.
Ruben Navarrete believes that Mexicans of American origin is torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico I walked down the corridor for arriving, approached the area of border controls, and remained in place.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for extranjeros (foreigners).
Few seconds I stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and my whole life called Mexican.
It is just a name, just as my friends in Boston to call himself Irish, and friends from New York see themselves as Italians.
Later I stopped on the "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Is here, in my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complicated structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answers.
But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers of language, and I can not get rid of an American accent.
Because I took his American passport and was in line for an extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when President-elect of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
Was the issue of the day for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drug trafficking and human trafficking.
The President of Peña Nieto to speak about the rise of the Mexican economy, which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of being moved to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the US and Canada, and to create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
Moreover, President of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were not there.
For Mexico's relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question.
The majority of Americans have not really thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and at the point of rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and a reminder of the events in all.
It is only any statesman to utter a word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society they had heard complaints about what Americans would infringe on the sovereignty of the neighbors.
And descendants of montezuma are filled with militancy.
The most complex is Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.
Obid want to talk about?
Them enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country the right, and those for whom such opportunities are not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - had not been able to achieve in Mexico and was forced to go to the North.
This was the Mexicans of a particular type - dark, education, poor peasant families.
We their descendants, and we remember this.
In Mexico, see it differently.
Today our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we are taught in high schools and a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream - American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and it is not clear, but we know what countries consider their own.
The United States of America.
Yet we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
We meet them the same.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class citizens as a fake Mexicans.
We are not speaking Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is due to failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not leave.
We would not be where we are right now for silk curtain, finding in the United States a pampered life, but lost a spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved to the United States legally as a child, and it reminds me that between the Mexicans and Mexican Americans there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Mexican Americans are upset.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belong to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Tigres Del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen.
By the best of two worlds, you will inevitably lose their roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
In the US call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during his trip, as if our relations already are not confused, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans worked as a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and was its interests in the United States.
We would be able to tell their friends - Americans, which is a beautiful country and how well her to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
There, of course.
Will not do.
Too many grievances in the past.
Given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think these countries such a beautiful.
I am sorry, but I can identify themselves, location.
And rightly so.
If the majority of Mexicans still can not forgive the United States how they interact with Mexico and a half century ago, they would have to accept, and the fact that some Mexican Americans still in pain for the way most recently in Mexico is that their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed to me.

Old battle of the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas can become fragile foundations for further peace
The prospects for a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
It sounds, the disputes, senseless, about who first began; many of the buildings are in ruins; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, released from the Gaza Strip of the rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel's Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his old conflict in the Middle East, came change.
This can be interpreted in many ways, events of the "Arab Spring" swing round in the storm a number of well-established reality, and the Palestinians and Israelis failed to stay away from the vortex, rocked the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more violent than before.
But there is reason to give hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate.
War without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if a ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be kept, which occurred this week of clashes only strengthened the hand of law enforcement agencies on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say, that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite incurred losses.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group were destroyed and 1.7 residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled part of our planet, they are not able to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas build its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory, currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that the time work for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas is a powerful and wealthy friends.
Resurgent regional leader Turkey, which once was the closest ally of Israel among Muslim countries, expressed support Hamas; have followed Qatar, one of the richest and developing countries of the Persian Gulf.
Triumphant supporters of Hamas claims about creating around Israel of Islamic crescent - from Lebanon in the North, which is ruled by the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which Islamist insurgents are about to topple the government of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the rule of King threatens allies of Hamas.
The most significant change the balance of power in the region have occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohamed Morsi has influence of the movement the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, does not have special attention to support Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are a lot like Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic constellations Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to turn even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "Hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" meet the costs of production and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas rockets.
Citizens of Israel can sleep well, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to its long-standing position; many European countries also blamed the latest round of violence in the Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, in particular in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, some 30 Israelis were killed by missiles fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through walls, which comes on the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River - a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protect Jewish settlements, which continues to grow despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party, in preparation for the January 22 elections - teamed up with even more bellicose conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, a very convenient.
What makes sense to encourage the Palestinians and to give them their own state?
If brought to their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, will not start if they can run from there rockets at Israel as their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind a wall and hard to suppress any attempt to head.
It is possible, supporters "Hard" line will win; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
With the Islamists, who comes to power in Egypt and other countries, have not the warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be domestic issues.
Defense part of the budget of Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The outbreak of the war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
The pragmatism of Egypt's President Morsi, who, together with Barack Obama worked on a ceasefire is a good sign and may mark the beginning of a change.
Israel, not least, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As the advent of democratic change in Arab countries, the hardships of the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that, sooner or later, will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, like the bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression has already is shaking the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, but demograficheskii - growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates the problem.
The deadly operation, which is held every few years on the territory of Gaza to crush Hamas movement, has to pay its growing influence of the international community.
Both sides need outside impuls
It is the only solution, which tirelessly encourages sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: two-state solution and the assignment of territories in exchange for Israel's security.
Hope, not too impressive in the short - term, hope that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence on the side of the conflict.
Egypt, which were long overdue decision to cut off the supply of weapons in the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar has, as ever, advantageous position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries also need to work towards reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah.
It would have done more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming UN vote, which could be a recognition of the virtual state of Palestine.
Its role in order to bring Israel to the negotiating table, to play and President Obama.
During his first term he did not own the peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows the unwillingness to connect to the solution of the problem.
It is disastrously shortsighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia became the law to create a unified and packaging for cigarettes.
Warning about the dangers of smoking and disease in the affected parts of the body in contrast to be devoted to dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world to Australian law on a package of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color registration of different-the same box is glum - olive color with a picture of the affected parts of the body and images of children, whose health has been smoking of their parents.
Pomimoraznyy pictures and captions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, imposed on with this Saturday - name brands, which published the same fine print.
This is the most severe in the world of conditions for packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia said that the goal is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of fashionable status.
The basis of such a decision were the results of research showing that people, not started to smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 will never become smokers.
"Obviously, the very young age children make sense, which is trying to bring the tobacco company with the help of the packaging," as minister of health, Tanya Plibersek, citing research showing that, for example, the Crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of Princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes do not affect the profit transnational corporations, the impossibility of those measures are already considering and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the proportion of black market, which will be sold cheap cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, other than those who thought the initiators" - Scott MacIntyre, a spokesman for the British American tobacco in Australia.
Producers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will provide much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, by contrast, the new laws have contributed to the growth of the business.
Sandré from a small family company Ḫāʾ Zico import Pty Ltd said that demand for cigarette and silicone covers, hiding unpleasant picture on the packaging, rocketed (almost from scratch) since the two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan tobacco lost a case in the High Court of Australia, where they tried to protest the law.
According to Sandra Ḫāʾ Zico, the company has already implemented some 6 thousand products enterprises of wholesale trade and expect the New Party.
For us it is a good business.
Potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures are, according to the experts, the popularity of social networking among this is the part of the population, which sent the measure.
In Australia after the adoption of a number of laws illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support of their sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers to make cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites to advertise on the network, but it can not limit in the foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco products and you have only small idea to promote their wares on the Internet will show you a very attractive," says Becki Freeman, an issue of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman increasing number of reviews of trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this was the work of an ordinary citizen, which is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare time and energy and made a video, or behind this advertising company?
The Australian unit of British American tobacco has said the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules, the advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the new rules: the state made no claims in the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying the trade was subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries' trade with Australia was very limited.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries to their similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada's first introduced mandatory placement of photographs, warning about the dangers of smoking.
In the rules adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening of laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Number of smokers in Australia has not obey innovations.
The picture I did not touch them.
I just do not pay attention.
"Merely draws a cigarette and hide it in your pocket" said Victor Al Haig, buying cigarettes with photographs of the cancer of the mouth of the pack.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me to give up my baby daughter.
James training, the manager of the store of tobacco products King of the pack in the centre of Sydney, has said the same packaging has complicated the task of the distribution of goods on shelves
"I have the unloading of the New Party took a hour, and now four hours" - he complains.
"The government had to take and, to ban cigarettes, we would have said: what to do, well, it is over, closed shop," he says, hands up.

In the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
In this Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours in the airport, because our plane was found mechanical problems and his other plane, which is what we were for.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I am not going to kid.
Noon at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help either book, or magazines, or iphone, nor even the duty-free shops.
But in recent years scientists and experts in child development is in favour of boredom.
They say that, in certain situations, for us and for our children to get bored is not so bad.
It forces the brain to be distracted by an interesting related topic, which probably contributes to creativity.
As in the modern world we are all constantly any screen, the advantages of boredom pass us.
Maybe we need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time.
We will come back to this point.
I, like many others, believed that boredom - invention relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
Not so, says Peter Twohy, a professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book "Fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a lively history, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, the boredom has a very ancient history," he said.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscription of boredom, dating back to the first century.
The open question is, how we perceive the boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.
The studies on the subject, and asking the task force in 100, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to this definition: boredom is when people "Want, but you can not do what they would meet."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that bored people do not do something that would like to do.
With apathy to do anything I do not want.
The boredom in the present, he said, is "a violation of the attention and related deterioration in mood and feeling that time, are slowly."
As boredom may seem very similar to the Depression.
But Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the cause of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself.
Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we would be hard for something to focus on.
In his study "One reason: the definition of boredom from the point of view of attention," published in last month's issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, participants listening to a recording of his voice, reading a magazine.
The participants were also loud sounds not related to the case of the programs are included in the next room, others have heard the same sounds on low volume, so their, you could barely make out, and a third group only listened to the recording of his voice without any sound track.
The participants, who heard the low level of volume, noted that they were bored, more than others found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we are trying to focus attention on the difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, said Mark J. Fensk, an associate professor of Neurology at the University of Gvelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something this, "For example, studying in the flow of merchandise on line in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is, he says, that when people start riding on a chair to portray picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but we now know that the number of such actions only help you to relax physically.
"Research has shown that children who are not prohibited to fidget and to turn, learn and remember more information than infants who want to sit down," said Professor Fensk.
In some points we are all bored: when the flight (as in my case), listen to a monotonous speech, watching this film.
But different people demonstrate or less prone to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure of such individual features researchers have developed a "The scale of the propensity to boredom."
For the definition of the scales are using questions and approval, for example, "Much of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved" or "Me too much fun, so anything that is not enough time."
With the help of these questionnaires the researchers found that boys skuchaem more girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, in particular in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
But teenagers generally often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment, in which he was linked with the help of pager with as many as 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% said that they get bored in school and at the time of his homework, and 23% said that they get bored out of school.
But only 3% of parents said that they get bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that, "The teenage peak prone to boredom," largely because children and teenagers do not allow in position to decide what they will do.
Back to my initial question: boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme, studies show that it can drive people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers are thinking about the link between boredom and creativity, says professor Vodanovich, dedicated study of the problem more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we need to do something different, and this is the boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain does not always know what better way to do it.
If you are going to be bored and you will find the energy to play the guitar or culinary experiments, you will make yourself better.
But if you get a TV, you will be better for only some time, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child missing and you give him the iPad, he will not be bored, but he will not be able to contend with boredom or as in other ways to manage their time and employment, says professor Fensk.
"And the skills of self-regulation is in many situations," he says.
Your child can learn not only entitled to occupy themselves something, he is also studying the self-control at all.
I do not think that boredom need some way to praise.
But to be a bad thing, however, is wrong.
Rather should learn how to feel comfortable even without the constant stream of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agree.
"We see that, we need more likely to experience boredom, and boredom is extremely unpleasant, an insatiable desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people are trying to show off the persistent worries and just relax.
"In the modern world, we are used to the constant over-stimulation of the sensory organs, he says, and when silence, we are lost and do not know what to do."

It is unclear how will be subject to a new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado
Anthony Orozko, a nineteen-year-old player of the football team and a student of public college in southeastern Colorado charged with a criminal offence, which holds that will soon be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of a small amount of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and riding in a car on the prairies near the border with Kansas, when they stopped by police.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco had subpoenas for possession of drugs and devices for possession of drug use - a minor offence for each of which is due to a fine of $ 100 - and the date of the hearing.
"With us were treated as criminals," says Mr. Orozco.
But criminal is he?
As a result of uncertainty, which has lasted several weeks after Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of thousands of small lawsuit does not depend so much on the law, but from the place of consideration.
Charged with crimes related to marijuana, has already been filmed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has adopted similar measures.
Police stations have already stopped condemned people age 21 and older for possession of small doses, what will happen to be lawful, as only a couple of weeks it will come into effect.
But in the more conservative counties in Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the cases related to marijuana, and still held liable for possession of the drug.
In some cities to the suburbs of Denver to mountainous areas of the West's vote that can be avoided in their places new licensed by the state of shops selling marijuana.
"All this is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect further," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora east from Denver.
The regulatory authorities in Washington state also puzzled by scratches his head.
They are to be established rules for defining the licensing of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and it should be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for good or evil, ahead of most of the other states in the regulation of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, first, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example" said Brian J. Smith, a representative of the Council on the regulation of production and marketing in the state of Washington.
But now no one can do more, says Mr Smith, than to put forward any proposal and hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent, in which we could focus," he said.
The Bill of Washington, called the I -502, will come into force on December 6 and on the whole year will put the state in a state of limbo, when the state licensing yet, and possession of marijuana has been legalized.
But there is still a difficult technical aspects, which need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the disposal of the state of "Adequate access" to licensed marijuana from a ban on trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It is especially difficult it will be to place a licensed Enterprise for trade in marijuana in a line of cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," as Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently released study "The centre of the legalization of marijuana."
November 21 the police chief Oates from aurors sent his subordinates by e-mail message that the prosecutor's office of the town will no longer have to involve people from age 21, responsible for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops are caught people in these violations "From this moment."
The police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance with the rules governing the operation in the town of those crops such as marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue traffickers and distributors of drugs.
Prosecutor Weld County in Northern Colorado, Ken Buck, a more rigorous approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill he said that his office will continue to prosecute the possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage was using it to pass a course of treatment.
The 119 people charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, though many of them are accused and other violations.
"The responsibility of our institutions - to pursue the action, which is considered a crime at the time of their commission," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
Reaction was controversial even in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
Police Grand Junction, the largest town in the District, no longer held liable quite-year-old for possession of small amounts of the drug.
Attorney Pete Khauttsinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take the allegations are already open cases connected with possession of marijuana.
"I believe that to ensure compliance with the law, as long as he does not change our direct responsibility," he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado, who took part in the vote, upheld the decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And contradictory reactions of people in different places of state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to experiment of state with marijuana.
"The district attorneys in this matter is cultural barrier" said Sean MacAlister, Denver lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana.
"They are people for so long for this, that it can not really to come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington, the first us, in which a small amount of marijuana are similarly to alcohol - is destined to become a pilot flying across the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Supporters of legalization and officials of the state plans to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time, they are apprehensive waiting for instructions from the federal government, which is still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Supporters of legalization of marijuana is hoping that the Justice Department had come to this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases to agree on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents by the anti-drug is unlikely to break into the home, to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to the regulated state stores of recreational marijuana, which is allowed under the new law, said Kevin a. Sabet, a former adviser on the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some town in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Before the presidential elections of some local administration approved moratorium on the opening of new stores for sale of marijuana, which could not open up sooner than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in a position that we will give somebody a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our town voted against the amendments.
And now there is a contradiction between the results of local elections and the vote, by what the state.
There remain many unresolved issues.

Petronella of Uayetty: I survived from Oxford for being conservative.
The prosecution of university students for their views is not new.
As I can remember, I have always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described him as the best in the world, educational institutions, the modern equivalent of ancient symposium, are the two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.
And yet, two weeks later, his studies at the Department of Worcestershire College, University of Oxford in the late Eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not stand and began to cry.
Friends was confused.
The newspaper the Evening Standard asserted that I dropped out, because I did not like it that my classmates have sex in the next room.
Writer Norman C. Wilson joked that I left, because I had to drink from Viktors Ščerbatihs cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I escaped.
Yes, ran away, because I have been hounded and intimidated.
Not because of my unusual name, or that I attended a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason only, and in this famous cradle of the light it was this barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Uayetty, was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You ask, why not to think about it now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students, with center-right views are subjected to the same bullying.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of students - conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as that accorded to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The Conservatives a club of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say that their "Often actively isolate, subject to personal attacks and makes you feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter in the Committee on Equal Rights College of additional representative to ensure freedom of expression of opinion.
The situation only worsened recently on the BBC 2 documentary about politics in this field "Wonderland: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives presented the eccentric and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives of the University of Oxford, who ride in Rolls - Royce, wears a silver suit and stick with silver bedknobs.
In other university students - conservatives complain that make scapegoats "Due to the higher fees."
Lucas black, 20, vice - president of the Association of conservatives of the University of Nottingham, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper said that " In the university environment is increasing bias of the left.
People, which we do not even know in advance if you think we are arrogant and gratuitously violent children of the rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history faculty of Corpus Christi College, which was submitted to a strengthening of security, called such an atmosphere "a comfortless," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Association of conservatives of Oxford University, said that the attitude of the members of the club to the carriers of the center-right views seriously deteriorated.
"It is a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, or simply to normal life of the members of the club," she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I did in September of 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford overtures from hatred for the Conservative Party.
The year before University voting deprived former student Margaret Thatcher of her a honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists.
In the first days of the week, when the freshman students work with each other and with professors, the first time I felt that was waiting for me to come.
I did not know that teachers not only did the harassment of students - conservatives, but gladly participated.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and disagreement of governments to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa have slipped through the plywood wooden panels walls of classrooms.
In my first seminar I had to translate the French text 18th-century English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.
"Miss Uayetty, said teacher, the late Harry Pitt, ' please, move your first paragraph."
The article gave me hard, I hemmed.
Harry Pitt was very Tylopilus man with a face like cake.
"Tetcheristy are not learning French or just did not have enough brains?" he asked.
Maniacally: other students.
On my eyes were filled with tears.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his free time, if you do not, of course, very busy, rotating in society" - Pitt.
I returned to my room is unhappy.
The night in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, second-year student of the Department of English, which is presented as a member of the Association of Conservative University.
" I know who you are friendly, he said.
- Unfortunately, things are as follows:
On everybody who is suspected of being sympathetic to conservatives, will be funny.
I am very easy, but in your case, they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because it will be more difficult.
Most of the freshmen - conservatives pretend that they are Labour ."
Later, at a local pub, I timidly tried to play.
I insisted that do not agree with all that, says Margaret Thatcher.
Trick failed.
First-year student of philosophy, politics and economy, which he studied at Eton, said: " You are the daughter of fascist pig.
You are contagious ."
Other students picked up his words.
I was damaged, dirty.
" As conservatives have sex? ' asked one of them.
- They beat each other, right? "
, I suddenly felt like I must have felt to criminal prosecution of homosexuals in the Sixties.
Will I ever to live normal lives in Oxford?
Or I will have to meet like-minded only under the cover of night?
Will I have to be a Labour and to conceal their true beliefs?
The year three was to be hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, of his conservative views, was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
Hated him not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser on foreign policy, Thatcher and one of her speechwriter.
In college, he has appeared.
He despised him for the provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist - determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy," said he.
I wanted to go to Oxford from parental home in London, seeking refuge with relatives and unbiased torrevieja friends.
I told my father I hate Oxford and explained the reasons.
He did not believe me.
During his school in the forties there were any political views.
" But it is the best universities in the world, said he is dismal.
- Out there on this fails, not in the town of dormant spires...
Even my friends - communists have always behaved impeccably ."
His wet eyes.
" Do not take any hasty decisions.
I am sure that it is just a joke.
You will get heart, if you throw University. "
I was exhausted regular trips to London and my emotional protection faded.
My friend, the conservative, could not handle the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
Next week at the seminar, when another teacher of history is seriously called me "Enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In my soul screamer from shame, I was brainwashed "I have parents," and called them "Old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was going to kill my father.
At the time each week he wrote two columns for newspapers, owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I am not a member, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they are gone, I packed a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I never returned.
Can call me cry-baby and rags.
But in eighteen years, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation to school.
The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen prime ministers, the Tories, but is still behind undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence.

The most difficult profession in the world: the miners from Kawah - Idzhena
To four Indonesian miners risking life and limb, 70 pounds of sulfur on top of the volcano the steep, rocky trails
There are people for whom their work - hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them Anthot Widjaja, one of the 400 miners who make a living from the extraction of sulfur in the volcano Kawah - Idzheny, located on the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anthot going down to the bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide, rising from the depths of the Earth, freezes on the air.
Otkolov huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of up to 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo basket, will place a basket on his shoulders and carry them out on a steep, rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, at a height of 2.386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted men more than 40 minutes to climb a snail's pace, with Labour holding the balance and careful road, so as not to fail and not to fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened with one tourist, France, which fell off a few years ago from rocks Kawah - Idzhena.
Miners from Kawah Idzhena 5 - Euro cents per kilogram of sulfur, which produces
Being at the top, they make his way between them tourists, who photographed, as if they were monkeys from the circus, and wearily carrying heavy basket, walking three kilometers to balance mining company, which was slightly higher, at a height of 1.850 meters.
It is about paragraph of Kandy Ngrimbi, the company, which operates with 1960, the volcano, and it is best not to say, their employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 Euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10.000 rupees (83 Euro cents) petrochemical plants, because this mineral common in everyday life and used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening of sugar.
"As the transport 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each," as we Anthot, usually three doubles.
He spends three hours on each of them and, in the end feels broken, but enable him to amass 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Though it seems to be little for such superhuman efforts, it is triple what he would have earned in the field.
"Journeymen diecimila miners very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is 2 million rupees (167 euros) ," says truckers, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75.000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and plot was not so heavy, but Anthot Banyuvangi returned with his family in a town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulphur: "I married the girl from Bali, a Hindu, and brought her to the Java, she had converted to Islam."
The Anthot asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he eye redness began to weep because of toxic gases
27-year-old Anthot spent three years, risking an in Kawah - Idzhena, sulfur, which has already begun to affect it in spite of the mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he is breathing with difficulty, constantly cough, and he eye redness began to weep because of toxic gases, which allocates volcano.
That is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"Will work for another two years, because they want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French" promises, he is more than acceptable English.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist at the hotel, but instead he carry out the work of the mule.
Sharing dirty wooden huts with other porters, he gets up every day in two hours of the night, because sulfur did not stop to emerge at night, when her distinctive yellow turns into the Blue and shines in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anthot goes down to the crater, illuminating his way with a flashlight, connected to his helmet, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters drag from Gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, mining company not mechanized production of sulfur for cost savings and it does not provide any equipment porters, who works at his own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they did not even receive part of 30.000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for photography, which, along with a ticket for 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the Zapovednik charged with tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its people - mules.
"This work for cattle, and not for people," said Badrusin, stocky and the Porter, who spent 42 years on Kawah - Idzhena three decades, since left the College.
Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he said he will accept work "As much as we can," because he needs the money for education of their three children aged 18 to 10 years.
Will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although sulfur is burning throat and burning eyes, when the wind suddenly change and catch miners in a thick plumes of smoke from the volcano, they are so Hardy that no one complains about their serious illness... More serious, obviously, than their usual trouble breathing, e.g., pain in his knees and on the shoulders, which is most under the weight of baskets.

Singapore looking for children to save the economy.
Singaporeans accuses career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needed to grow."
I husband Patriot, you were my wife, follow our civic duty and will create a life!
May seem incredible that this line is part of the advertising of mints then, but despite that - or perhaps because of it - it became a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
This phrase is part of the rap, which uses local saying such as "Let's put Bao (roll) at the stove" to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
Advertising agency, which made the video, bbh, hope that, with the help of advertisements they will be able to draw attention to the problem in entertainment form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music, so that people had made "Its national debt."
These things exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is a major problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of humans, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government was trying to do, for example to be launched spirits with pheromones or Party of rapid dating (blitz - visits).
Many of these ideas, perhaps, was creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why do not we make the most creative things from possible to solve the problem, namely to compose rap?
1.2 child
Who do not take it so lightly, it is the government of Singapore.
It spends $ 1.300 a year on policies for inspiring the citizens of having more children.
State package for couples and parents provide up to $ 15.000 per child, prolonged pregnancy and maternity leave and provide tax relief.
But it has low efficiency.
Singapore is rich and high-tech state - town in South - East Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his public scrutiny.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to the National Directorate of the population, are currently at 1.2 children per woman.
It was last below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976.
Singaporeans so why not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of the office's policy of couples and families of the National Authority for the population, says that this is "an Education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a broader range of options when it comes to life's goals and priorities, in addition to marriage and the family," explains it.
These changes of social norms and the growth in the number of bachelor and postponing marriage and the birth of a child, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to a sharp increase in immigration to counter the decline in the population, an outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, which is barely disguised xenophobia in many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who criticized for keeping salaries, and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons why the last year, Singapore's ruling party received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the birth rate has known impact on the economic growth of the nation, tax revenues, expenses for medicine and politics of immigration, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected.
The government is making efforts to not have been built so many small housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development proceeded to control the number of small apartments, known as the "Shoe box," which you can build in certain areas of the city.
The apartment of 46 square metres very well be sold.
However, believe that they can contribute to a single way of life and deprives the incentive of developers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, director of the House-building firm the developers, said that the "Shoe box" is selling faster than larger copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that the apartment is sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than the apartment of a larger size.
As a result, our cash flow increases.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the new rules give a clearer guidelines for developers, which had previously been obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overextended
Singapore is the city - state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing national birth rate, after talking with Singaporeans, who works in the financial quarter of the centre, it seems, that they will have little effect.
"People are very overstretched, expensive, as well as housing and education, and because of that many people are put off," says young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it was important to have their own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons, which makes it hard for them to have children.
So, as the Government has tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, as regards to childbirth, the last word to the Singaporeans.

Personal online - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is about a private properties or "Of personal life, which has a right to defend itself from any interference."
That is personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he used the term in their everyday lives and in the social networks?
Does he not understand the risks to the discussion on the Internet, and that is not shared outside the Internet?
Interviewed five people from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases they are associated with the term "Something very my," in personal terms, and "The user name and password," when applied it to the social networks.
"My biggest secrets I would not have downloaded in Post," says the ten-year-old Jorge, when trying to explain personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he is already two years.
"It is a secret, my mom can to know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On fb I downloaded a beautiful picture or a picture of the games.
I have fun with their friends.
"I would not be shared photographs, which is not mine, or someone who behaves stupid," he said.
The boy realizes that bad to publish indecent photographs of naked people, crimes or write a fierce offensive or comments.
Jorge said he knows of 35 friends, who in his fb, and nine of its in Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
Mother in the course, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started a Twitter to express themselves and to write interesting tweets.
"I do not know whether me, I just loaded" he added.
"Social media - entertainment, I can speak with distant relatives or family, friends and - fast," he points out.
Not hesitate to say that never would request from a stranger.
Would not be considered with someone who would stranger.
The 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager is open an account at Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the past that he did not know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It is not me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one to him is not with confidence and did not ask his home address or phone number.
"If I would be to pressure or to simply remove them from their accounts" - he admits.
Jose became a follower ask the recommendations in Twitter.
The boy never experience, what is known as cyberbullying.
One my girlfriend had blackmailed into social network.
He threatened and extorted money.
"He would not know who it was," he assures us.
The victims, according to Jose, did not delete account.
"Only included confidentiality."
He explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a way that is safe.
Unlike Jorge, this rebooted would be familiar in the photographs or situations.
Yes, I would have done it if I do not like or if I feel like it.
"Although I know that it is cyberbullying" - confirm it.
Key questions
Maryelos Porras, our teacher of English and an expert on education and training, said that to keep the children and teenagers, need to understand that the purpose of the social networks to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she notes.
Porras indicate that was Mark Prenski, master of education at Yale University and author of the Labour digital natives and immigrants, invented the terms for an explanation of this phenomenon.
Digital natives they, children and young people, who was born in an era of technology.
"We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we still learn," she said.
Explains that this issue is complex, "Because we are asked to have a certain criteria for what can or can not be extended, to the public or to speak, at an age when it is not enough for this."
"Also to be selective, while the more important for them to be popular, to have thousand friends, not thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality children and adolescents, is to ask questions, which makes them to think.
"To tell them that they did not do this, it is useless" she added.
Then Porras lists some options: there are things that you are not a stranger to anyway, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have been happy if published photographs you like the one that has published you about a friend?
Do you know what other published about you?
When you sign a photograph with parties, ask whether you are letting other people, to commemorate them?
And another, everyone needs to know, what are you doing in every moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they have to behave online, the same way they are offline.
The rules are the same.
"Beyond the Internet rights deal with respect, responsibility and other principles, should also be on social networks," she says.
Vigilance.
Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, a professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for leaders of the families have read the policy of social networks.
With each of the points they have a good basis for discussions with children about the implications of the discovery of the Internet.
"For example, age and that allowed to distribute or to publish," he said.
The Gaurdiya, the key question is to remind children of lessons "Do not talk to strangers."

Confirmation both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice, was right after Colombia protested against this week of Bogotá pact, according to which she was carrying out their verdicts of the International Court of Justice in the aftermath of the maritime border with Nicaragua, which she considers erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff of; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.

"South America should learn from Europe in the issue of the integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the joint citizenship is the goal, in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa VI, who participated in a presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, Peru, state television said that Europeans "Killing each other during the second world war," and in other clashes, "But now they are one country."
He defended the project, in this context, the establishment of American citizenship, which encourages members of the Unasur.
"We need to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American countries, as is happening with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sector, which want to take us back to the past" - he warned.
The Ecuadorian President manifested itself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the prerequisite to reduce the impact of the Anglo-saxon States and to take into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose for the protection of human rights.
Those who lecture, never undertake no obligation, and we in the South Americans, by contrast, signed by all.
"Inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum in Ecuador, the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that does not regret his decision, because he betrayed its principles, and comply with its "Deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at one time, "Was a suspicion that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be observed process."
He criticized, moreover, Swedish Justice of the requirement to be on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual offences, while "The Swedish legislation to make it through videoconferencing, which it could be from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of their physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken with him ever since he arrived in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problems, nothing serious," said the head of state.
What does have is a danger of damaging his physical and mental health because of imprisonment in a small space without the opportunity to exercise on the air.
"This affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange, with June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity, which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that the talks in London in search of a solution to the problem of the imprisonment of the founder of the WikiLeaks.
We are not talking about human rights, the word in this case we do not use it, but there was a constant debate.
"I think the solution is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden, and the judiciary, because a lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzón, is a series of processes in various European institutions" - mentioned it.
And said that "If Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will be over."
And if Sweden, how well will enable the legislation and as it has done in other cases, will question Mr. Assange of incitement in London or will question him on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that there is "Mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distorts the freedom of expression."
"The enemies of freedom of the press is not tainted villains, politicians, and journalists who will gain, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect he remained thankful that is not the journalists, "The bankers, not bourgeois country's hegemonic does not rule in Ecuador," and added that, being re-elected, "Will deepen the Revolution for its continued development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain veto of Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the "Must be firm and not to tolerate opportunism and support of coups in the mask of legitimacy" because in reality "It has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President found, moreover, "Perfectly reasonable" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to Nicaragua are now negotiating with the maritime border between the two countries after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which is in favour of nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment it is not enforced.
This problem between South America and Central American countries.
Conflict is inevitable, but they must be overcome a desire to move together.
Need to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good outcome of the dispute over maritime borders, which is in the same court Peru, and Chile, and said that "The right thing for Latin America to go to the International Court, if the two countries agree to accept the solution, however difficult it may be."
About the opportunity to appear as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he said, he considers this opportunity "With optimism and joy, although sometimes quite hard."
Correa assured that if I lose the election in February of 2013, then from public life.
On a personal note, I have never been interested in power, but in this unjust situations, as in Ecuador, socio - economic poverty can be remedied only on the part of political power.
"My political movement considered, I am guaranteed the likely victory, so we have to admit that responsibility," he said.
If this would be my last term in office of the President, and then we move out of public life.
If you lose, the same.
"This decision," confirmed it.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to the treatment, which is already planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will miss the campaign, to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean growing in the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the state today took part in Lima, VI summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration for the maintenance of progress, equality and security.

AIDS mortality today - a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS led to a positive result.
"I like he" - he recalls the difficult, despite all the time of the moment.
He hid it from his family.
Determined to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to know more about it as much as possible. And his effort was - he mentioned his 43 birthday.
Fabrizio - one of the "Oldest" patients HIV - branch of the hospital, hospital civil de Guadalajara (hcg), where he was in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He live with the diagnosis "Of the human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) is 22. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too little then there was the treatment options, too little known about the disease, too have treated patients.
So the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of social protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "Because he had cut."
In other words, at the time, to have AIDS was sentence.
Now possible to survive the syndrome and to do so, not to the detriment of quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, many people are still coming, when the virus has already damaged, "Depleted" their immune systems and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first alleged, "Great achievement for the moment, however, is that the survival of patients, who start treatment on time, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same," Bulgaria's head HIV - secession hcg, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that the information was confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a verdict, however, life expectancy and quality of life depends on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available to patients with early diagnosis, with the best life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4, and 50, when it reports on 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that those who receive a diagnosis of HIV - positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "Maintaining control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess the progress, we should remember that life expectancy of Mexicans today with an average age of 76 years.
Although death rates have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS declined from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report, Unaids), it is equally true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and has recorded 187 deaths to may this year; however, that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why there are still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem was not access to treatment.
The way I think, so it is in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years there has been no lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because of his positive status, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He led a devastating this: "nine out of ten patients come in when you have some opportunistic infection; what to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, is to make assessments at an early stage, and it is therefore necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all people, which it will ask."
In its proposal has the same opinion experts and officials of the state Council on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who went to check in a private laboratory, motivated by nothing but his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of Aids and even had Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer, which is one of the more common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some will die, and do not want to know.
"Time will still die, I will be nadiraeshsya three times a week," they say. - but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I do eat, exercise, taking drugs.
Today, his parents know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of class, I travel, an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, take care of yourself and of another man," a - listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with milenio Jalisco, to encourage his statement those who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, with fear.
Let him test, if there was a risk of infection, even as soon as possible know whether they are HIV - positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other man, being responsible.
It is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Big gap between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, I think Ricardo Salazar, a journalist in Guadalajara that have HIV.
Andlargest this Prevention.
In places that are devoted to the task, "Actually increased distribution of condoms, before we were one or two, now gives us packages for hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to condoms," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why are you?" it is a popular question, with and condemnation, by social workers, school counselors, employees of pharmacies and health workers, who do not want to hear teens, assured propagandist.
Proposes to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only for me and to hundreds of thousands of them were in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It is not promoting promiscuity.
It is not a question of the beer and motel, said the governor Emilio González, when asked if the distribution of condoms in his leadership.
"It is not sexual, it is best to make condoms available for those who already have sexual activity," he said.
Key data in Jalisco
Total registered 13.435 cases of HIV-AIDS, and 1.317 (12.158).
State is in the 4 place in the national rating on new and total cases of AIDS and 13s for HIV.
92% of infections are related to sexual way through blood, 6% and 2% for Perinatal way.
an estimated 50 thousand people can live with HIV, as per registered case from 4 to 5, which does not know it.

Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision, which cancel debt restructuring of the group in vitro, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the script set a dangerous precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in neighbouring countries, which have a problem with solvency.
It seems that the procedure in support of the survival of the firms, which allowed Mexican laws, is not valid in the country of the world, and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In the political sphere, the approval of the decision made by the June 15-judge Harlin Hale bankruptcies in the District Court of the Northern District of Texas, left defenseless Mexican firm in the face of the possibility of the seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
But the decision opens the door leading producer of glass in Mexico for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, resulting in three the discrepancy.
By way of introduction, while the judge it notes that lenders must be regulated by the US bankruptcy code, Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, based in New Orleans, said that the main proceedings for competitive production, seen in Mexico.
The first paragraph implied the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of the global profile.
In fact, the goal would be made available to the United Nations in the unification of international trade law, determining the arbitrator American Institute of law.
Secondly, the verdict stated, that without firms vote, the critical mass of competitive production of debt that was before the parent company branches in vitro, he would not have achieved majority needed to approve the restructuring.
Nevertheless, this opportunity recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, vitro was not the first time, when it is this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana firms, whose debts guaranteed federal Institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that less voice of branches, somehow or other creditors vitro, which fought against him in the courts of the United States, which funds "Vultures" like Aurelios capital, Aurelios convergence, was Internacional and Liverpool limited, does not have a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37.
This Court of Appeals for security.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which he has faced since 2008, affected by severe economic crisis, which hit the United States, and attacks on the country.
The company of family Gonzalez of the Garden would make the appeal at the Court of Appeals that vote came to the plenum, that is, the five judges voted, because only three.
In case of failure will be charged with the application for registration, which will require revision of the process by the High Court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the Court rejected the document, directed by the Mexican government as amicus curiae (" Friend of the Court "), on the process, which should vitro in the framework of the law on competitive industries, indicating that it relieves himself from compliance with the agreements, signed by both countries, to link it with article 15 of the US bankruptcy law.
In addition, the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules that apply to cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantees equal rights for debtors and creditors.
Carom billiards from two sides: they beat in vitro and beat in the country.
The overall balance

Hector of "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The avid basketball Traveler Hector of "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years this sport and, thanks to him, over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico stored in memory so many basketball stories, as Hector of "Hetin" Reyes.
And before the bleeding in the brain confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was put in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player, the small categories, the player's top basketball league, and chief Internet with the Cowboys Bayamona and President of the Federation of basketball.
"I have done many roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at the same time, when I was President Ip, director of the national team and the President in the 90s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, where he lives with his wife, Isabel, his faithful for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is wrong, making this statement.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia items collected for his long way, evidence of that.
Bayamón, Puerto Rico in the heart
The emotions he kept those who remember his way through the Cowboys, since the mid 50s as a player until 1982, when it was 15 years of his performance in the single - mandate an agent or an agent of the contract.
" It was my best years, which I enjoyed most of all, because I had the opportunity to be part of eight the Cowboys from 1967, as the agent - agent or manager.
It was many years of joy, including five world Championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome's in the Internet.
The moment and will continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator " - said Reyes.
I remember that Gina Bártová, who headed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you there is a very strong player, rising 6'7."
"Do you want?"
And it was early debt, one of the best players, who were from Puerto Rico.
Bártová then recommended sniper of Raymond Gauss, which received citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember that said if the debt brought the Championship Bayamona, Gauss would have helped to win another.
Having the Cowboys with Gauss I am, but at a distance, because the 1988 were part of the head of the Federation.
By the time I just want to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments supposedly in the national team.
Remember when we won the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 world Championships, where we got the fourth place and this was going to be the bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us to beat the final game, said Reyes.
The team to the 1990 world Cup is the best team, what you have ever seen?
It is among the best, as well as those that won the dream team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite were the ones that, with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and broke the United States, which was quite similar to the one we won bronze at the World Cup.
To the team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico of Lopez and "Pikulina of" (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) "Tonito" and James Carter, Brothers Leone (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote of" Morales, who is unable to attend in 90 because of a knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was a team of 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Kanito" Nieves, Pablo Alisea and young rolando of Khurruitner for players, temporarily suspended for the mess in the Pan-American Championship of La Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, it was Pikuliny Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico not dominated at this level, like Pikuliny.
And that does not include his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican head?
It is a very complex issue.
We had a very good young, including Julio Toro, Flora of Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of young, I like work Leo Arilly.
What do you think his major achievement in the Federation?
Part in the most glorious era national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s the Internet had to 17 teams in the season.
What you need to do?
There were things that I wanted to do, for example, the regionalisation of smaller categories.
For example, that the boy Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now guys go and play too much, and it is unnecessarily.
At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and course management, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing?
I listen to music, watch music videos my era on Youtube, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, and Abel, which has always been with me.

The course, which explores the "End of the world?"
Each week, students explore phenomena, such as nuclear war, apocalyptic zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when a professor of religion Stewart sharma decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he was irresistible bait: the end of "Long countdown of the" Mayan calendar, December 21, who have seized many people as evidence that heralded the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call the "Long-term," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where the Christian theorists of the end of times I believe that it is the apocalypse.
"I did not realize that this will be the most apocalyptic terms of all," said sharma this week, students at Rutgers University - Camden (New Jersey).
If you analyze what is happening in the world today, as if we have only 30 days, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of "The End of the World" in this semester, the last in history.
In Temple University associate professor Barry Wacker-course, "The media, culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why this idea is spreading," he said, and the way in which offers a hypothetical scenario, of certain actions of man.
If nuclear material were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, can get the war.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with the real-life examples.
"I tried to tell students about what is possible, perhaps, it is impossible," said Wacker -.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America, Matthew Restally and his colleagues of Amar Solari, an associate professor of the history of art and anthropology, gathered to read the course, which is called simply "The end of the world."
"We do not add '2012 ', to always be able to read the course again, in case the end of the world will not come," said Restally.
Despite the "Destruction," students should learn, to prepare projects and to take the final exams.
In Penn State's final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that does not leave the students of choice but to work "To the same night, in which is expected to be the end of the world," said Restally.
Courses were quite popular.
"Place ended two hours," said Restally about his students with the highest average score, in which 35 students.
We received an e-mail message for weeks before the semester from people who asked whether another place.
Students, in turn, gave assurances that the rate of one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch, which makes people to console himself" said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of separation of religion and sociology from Khaddonfild, New Jersey, in Rutgers - Camden.
And apocalyptic thinking, secular or religious, it is just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Vekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he watched the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of course, which would teach this" - he said.
I like it.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor said that does not believe in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project was the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways it has discredited" said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old student of the last course in Temple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restally.
But he noted that there was an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which goes back centuries, where people respond to changes around them, often predicting the end of the world.
The Internet have expanded the speculation.
"In other places people do not think about it," he said.
In the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any rate of "The End of the World" there.
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world" - he wrote, referring to the order of the Supreme Court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restally noticed that have long been talked about for many days of the final judgment and said that, if nothing will happen on December 21, "People will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to saying that December 21 is the beginning of the year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refers to that date.
Some said that we are going to go to parties of "The End of the World."
"It may be, will call someone from friends, to laugh" said Samir Ford, a 20-year-old student at the school of communication.
