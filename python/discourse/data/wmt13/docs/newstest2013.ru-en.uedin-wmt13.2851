The Republican strategy of resistance to Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies by the necessity of combating spin in the election.
However, in the centre of бреннана believe last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike.
In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is for certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American states are responsible for organizing the federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009, accept the laws of the registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result, only one 2011 was taken 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in 41 states.
The new laws on elections require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, voter registration упраздняют right on the day of the balloting and take away the right to vote among citizens who have the conviction.
Before the elections of 2006, no US state does not oblige voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state, which introduced such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law in 2008, adopted in Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states.
During the last two years, they initiated bills, forcing voters to present identification card with a photo, in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec American citizens do not have such universal identity cards, as health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of American citizens, i.e. the 21 million people who have reached the required for voting age, do not have identity cards with a photograph, issued by the government of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012, do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low income.
Indeed, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of citizens over 65 years old and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years did not have the required ID card with a photo.
But that's not all.
The students - voters who are believed to be voting for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state has not demanded evidence of U.S. citizenship to vote.
It is the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Starting in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures, apparently aimed to limit the vote of immigrants from Latin America.
It is believed that two-thirds of Hispanic voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws упраздняющие registration of voters on election day in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register.
This restriction does not passed without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign to register voters helped make the lists of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall by 17% of the registration of new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African, although recent accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with come from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites who, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several projects of the laws was ветировано governors Democrats.
The action of the most controversial laws was suspended for intervention by the attorney general of the United States.
This has partly to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring presenting identity card with a photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules into effect, of course, will make the exercise of voting rights in the elections of 2012.
The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them a clear direction to affect the 2012 election results in key states.
The report from the Center for бреннана 2011 demonstrates that states that accepted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions are partly discredit system of American democracy.

Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the test of the dog gives sometimes erroneous results лженегативные and sometimes лжепозитивные that lead to unnecessary medical intervention.
The men, and so reluctantly undergoing clinical examination, there are what hesitate even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of the two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, were observed numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so it is difficult to interpret the data and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, found different levels of mortality in patients who were screened and those who have not passed.
The study also showed that after a 12-year-old observation that the likelihood of metastasis by 30-40% higher than those who had not passed screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or with 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men are African American also are at higher risk.
The key is making the right decisions, as soon as the cancer is detected.
The cancer can be as aggressive and вялотекущим.
The patient needs to clarify the risk of cancer, offering him the options, without mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and making choices in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many men who have detected the cancer, will undergo a course of treatment because their cancer was not aggressive and do not pose a threat to life.
We will them offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly, we have to define the criteria for making decisions about who should or should not pass the course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.
But it is also important to check with your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, мовембер created a tool to assess all the pros and cons of passing the test on the dog.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle-recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all the people were great and quite moving, 30% of cases RACO could have been prevented.
"if no one smoked, the figure rose to at least up to 50%," said Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, an estimated 10% of the cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.
For the Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is doing immense harm to the health of people.
"even today in Quebec there are 1.5 million smokers," says the press secretary Andre Beaulieu.
Payroll: ten years after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight of
According to Kar, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and ovarian cancer.
"research shows that regular physical activity for a lifetime protects against colon cancer," adds to the association.
The food
The association also recommends that limit the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risks of cancer of the colon.
Also should be avoided meat products.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or засола may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"the past can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," explained to the association.
B vitamins
In recent years, many scientists were engaged in studying the impact of vitamin on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies is not exactly clear.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not completely clear.
But Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor.
"hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer."

Higgs бозон details
Last summer the message that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs бозон caused a real boom - and not without reason.
It is believed that this бозон explains the mass of all particles in the universe, no.
In addition, is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model, our best, or, at least, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, "but which had not managed to uncover experimentally.
But the physics is not yet completely confident that he was talking about бозоне Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that it strongly resembles бозон Higgs predicted the standard model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, although for the full confidence of some data still lacks.
Imagine all the same, that we are talking about бозоне Higgs, because the chances of mistaken seem minimal, and see what it means.
There are, in this world one law is absolutely inevitable that recalls that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, even don't try too hard, otherwise harm themselves.
But although the particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of similar nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which posits that the two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "Elementary" is a "state" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
On this, the particle physics is divided into two categories.
In one corner, we find the good citizens, called фермионами who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
In the other, scurrying around бозоны, stark Banda anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they can be safe in the same place at the same time.
According to the website (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure Berkeley Lab, these бозоны split, in turn into two groups: мезоны that we are here to say we will not, and "particles of power" through which apply basic forces of nature and that in some way relates бозон Higgs.
These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all such exotic creatures such as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, then it is thanks to one incredibly banal бозону: фотону, or "particle of light," which is a "courier" electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when one particle with the electrical charge, is accelerating or changing direction, it "violates the" electromagnetic field in this particular place, just like the stone in the pond.
From this "violations" born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc.), and this wave is nothing like фотоном - and, therefore, one of the carriers "бозонов force."
The more stable field
The same thing is happening with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that to this бозон appeared to be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable electromagnetic field; that his Institute, the need to achieve a very, very high energy, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface of which could shake only very large stone.
That is why we need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
Indeed, not all the particles and not all of the materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have mass, while others (like photon, by the way), it does not have.
So, what "can do" all of these studies, asked Ms. пламондон?
In science, they are used to validate the Standard Model (see), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts.
Moreover, some of them passionately yearn to such divergence discovered because any disagreements may open the door for a "New Physics" and plug some holes model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, not offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates about 80% of the universe (ouch-ouch!).
But so far at CERN such conflict have not found.
Consequences of the
The benefits from these studies for the daily life of the average person is harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 1960s pioneers laser research at Bell Labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but not more than that.
Indeed, since the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960, was invented the laser, and who himself has developed the first continuous laser (previous were импульсными) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine....
And besides, the application may be a tool for accompanying the study.
For example, the same уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it does not have its original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
It is, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... | "debt"
The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate will soon be resumed, and at this time is preparing a bill.
Nevertheless, in this important area much remains to be done.
"the debt" attempted to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in монтережи.
Prostate cancer, разрушавший inside him, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor-гадбуа in белёй where arrived the day before.
"but it's always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease is doing its job: incredible weakness, which does not give yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat.
Sitting at the table, on which is a delicious lunch, he relents and agrees that helped him to eat.
He бодрится even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead him into the bath.
Courage in the normal death.
"my greatest desire to me cured from diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this sickness.
"for the life we are taught that a man must pee standing," said Pierre Browder, a psychologist at the orphanage, Victor-гадбуа.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"everything depends on the ability of the person" adjusting to the decline, "he said.
Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline.
The patients who arrive in palliative shelter Victor-гадбуа, all suffering from cancer.
Forecasts say they have a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."
Ms. A., 89 years old, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to know their children.
"I have a good children," she added.
"I want nothing more in life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask, relieving breathing.
She still waiting in the coming days, the last visit his son, recruited from Italy.
In the runaway victor-гадбуа with the help of a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is the palliative care, which remains when nothing more can be done.
To make the death of more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one seat in the institutions of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later, we are all dead.
Here, life continues in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian мартель - one of the doctors shelter.
Whether it's the comfort of the physical, emotional or soul.
Dying we agree to provide ротовые rinse of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks.
We are not forcing more diabetics control blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought the beer, Mr. H., who died last night.
On the morning of his son swilled down a beer in the legs of the late.
"we are helping the relatives, as well as the patients," said Nathalie Savar, director of care.
In the runaway victor-гадбуа not one day is not similar to the previous one.
Next to a 93-year old man who enjoys his last meeting with family in the yard, relaxing on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, wife and two small children and перепробоваший everything to survive.
"in the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients under the age of 45 years," says Dr. Christian мартель concerned.
53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor-гадбуа, come from the house, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is available to alleviate the suffering of patients who had entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, at the hospital or in the orphanage.
And some institutions, such as shelter Victor-гадбуа and society of palliative care at home of Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
It is this big gap in the health care system Quebec is causing many palliative care doctors fear the adoption of the law, легализирующего assisted death and assistance in suicide.
Since October circulates manifesto signed beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. балфуром маунтом and Dr. Bernard ляпуантом and endorsing the their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr Christian мартель, Quebec health system is effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before they will be allowed to move to euthanasia.
Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid that patients are willing to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic predictions.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard have already been minimal when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I'd stop treatment, she replied that she regrets that, I stop the fight, "she said.
At the same time, she herself told me that my days are numbered!
No powerful care
Dr. мартель believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank the medical personnel, for what they have not fulfilled their request, after the team of palliative care eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not omnipotent in dealing with pain.
According to Alcee Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care at home of Montreal, patients are not susceptible to anaesthetic in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient is sleeping until his death, or from time to time, or permanently.
Can't even pretend that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, can have access to palliative sedation.
The patients suffering from pain, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I wish I had assisted death," which means "I want, I felt much better."
The establishment of this report was made possible by a grant from the journalistic Research Institute of Health Canada.

Large-scale scandals with real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and the Italian mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system," опутывающей construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and enforcer.
"the industry, which is very costly to taxpayers Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"it's curious how this system breaks down after they were put on the case all means, joked Jacques дюшено, MP and former police chief Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011, the scandal as a product of the investigation into the misconduct related to road-building contracts in Quebec, on which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean ball, very reluctantly agreed.
"the report дюшено" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, the Ministry of Transport would have kept only one billion dollars in contracts," if some withheld their instincts to take part.
The commission шарбонно "has already shifted two mayors," he added, hoping that she could "open the scheme behind individuals."
Permanent division to fight corruption, created in 2011.
In the case of подключилось created in 2011, the permanent division to fight corruption, which included extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, moreover, the staff of the special unit "hammer" that after the 2009 forced "сточный cartel" Montreal, stop the overstatement of the value of the contracts.
Over the past weeks has conducted a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular the franc website and ришару маркотту - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
The line - Gilles вайянкур, recently retired from the post of mayor лаваля, the third-largest city in the province of Quebec.
Неоднократном was suspected of receiving bribes for government contracts.
In addition, the indictment was charged several engineers service railways Montreal and building contractors of Italian origin, including Tony аккурсо and Lino замбито.
The last blew a real bomb, after investigators about the "system" of receiving government contracts.
For several years, замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal, an unidentified intermediary, linked to the mafia, which in turn transferred party mayor жеральда Trembley "joint Montreal."
In the 2000 "s замбито сорил money right and left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) of the various parties province, mostly liberals who came back in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie нормандо.
Sewer contracts, in which the victors altered the
In Montreal, "system" corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles сюрпренан, a former civil construction engineer, described in detail her before the commission: in the ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on the matches in hockey and bribes in a total of 736 million dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that were, завышая accounts for 30-40% using fake additions.
Then one organizer of the Party mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr Trembley that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of the parallel budget наполнявшего party vault of dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trembley resigned in early November, plunging the Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal, забивших anxiety.
Mayor of Riviere-de-прэри in the east of the island, she is opposed to the 2010 sale of municipal area, purchased for $5 million and перепроданного... for 1.6 million developers at the height of the construction boom.
The 70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be launched, "she pulls the plug, allowing to understand the functioning of the system, infested ants to stop гангрену and identify the perpetrators."
This process she характерезует as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but the city will need its own investigation team and the observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
As we убираемся at home.
Regularly. "
Jacques дюшено notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he was especially worried about the role of the "elected officials who knew about this scheme," but not participating in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money to finance the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but, according to him, it will not change the situation: "while we are not going to strictly limit political spending, in politics are dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing of political parties: "we can't go below; boldly recognized the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."
If this story and tarnish the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. дюшено urges those who laughs, look in your own backyard.

"Paris St Germain - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you're in Paris St Germain have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but may - and a new dimension of Paris St Germain.
Of the great players.
Next to them I'm growing every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not распаляюсь.
From the beginning, in the center of the preliminary preparation in the NIF in клерфонтене and prior to my arrival in Saint-Etienne I always strode forward.
Thus, you will benefit from the competition set Carlo Ancelotti....
Topping this summer is not a novelty to play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training session is very important.
This leads to what a player like me, wants to be at the level and the place to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He helps substitutes such as Claude макелеле, who played in the same position that I am.
Ancelotti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect all the technical staff.
Today, in the first league, he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with the top clubs.
He worked with great players. "
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January, I have a conversation with him was reassuring.
Then I moved from a series of injuries.
The trust, which he has also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season, Paris St Germain?
In the first league leader Lyon took place at us.
"but we remain ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we are spectacularly qualifying in 1 / 8 finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, all can be.
We will be able to say his word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto to be able to accept the return match in one-eighth finals.
Paris St Germain will become the first European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure position in the long term.
Today, it is not so.
Financially from Paris St Germain has the means to make this project a reality.
Not to take the title in the first league as last season, will be the biggest failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are valid ardently wish to win the league title.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, it was a disappointment because we had everything to come in first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that in the fight for the title have such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Do you not think that the media expect too much from Paris St Germain?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have the players.
We are fully ready for this.
On the other hand, when we chose home 4-0 against Troyes and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit frustrating.
We wonder, what the first place people expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who already has two seasons fails to pass into one-eighth finals, although they, too, have spent huge amounts of money!
Given the amount invested, we have already represented by 15 points ahead for winter failing.
It would be a disregard for our opponents and for the tournament in France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new Paris St Germain.
This shows just how compelling the first league.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Paris St Germain seems completely dependent on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say that there is an "златанозависимость."
It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he has scored a lot of goals.
He came to do this and he proves that he is the star of the first league.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did, it's really exclusively.
It stimulates and others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
How do you survived the Euro 2012 against France?
The disappointment.
I earnestly wished to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.
There I have seen many things, and I came out stronger.
Today I manage to play a good qualifier matches.
This is what I hoped since my baptism in blue.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well.
What do you think of the first months of Didier дешама led blue?
They effective for him.
He has a good position in the group for the World Cup.
He's strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires for victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to compare.
Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified the US into the euro.
I hope that Didier дешам lead blue to Brazil.
The good deserved the draw (1-1), вырванная 16 October in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match has given us confidence in themselves.
Each fought for all.
Prior to that, the shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.

Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange based on центробанках numbered transactions between the parties receiving C commission fees on their treatment.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented сатоши Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure the type of exchange protocol BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already had registered with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take биткойны for donations or as a means of payment.
The course биткойна, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to 2 dollars before returning today about ten dollars (rates are indicated on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared with the global exchange real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
Биткойн he describes as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies as "credits" used to advance in a video game that is earned during the game, or that it might buy (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed a similar system.
But the operation is always exchange controls and processes of any central authority.
The биткойн all nodes of the network are simultaneously holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers exchange, покупателыми and vendors.
How this network?
Each deal between two users actually happens between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
The set of information relevant to this transaction, signed by electronically, using encryption system with a double key.
The network also can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file may check that биткойны used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounting book разосланной across the network.
A key step is the registration of new transaction in this book.
She passes through the decision of mathematical tasks разосланной computers, decided that, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about hashing phase of the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in the digital signature, short and unique.
"computers take" a new transaction and add to her room before the "хэшировать" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, the other sites are easy to check it properly.
The transaction is thus нерарзрывно associated with the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If the user with the aim of deception very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice the topic, the money, the only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would have remained unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, determined to task, receives 50 биткойнов.
To avoid inflation, reward regularly is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of биткойнов in circulation so limited 21 million, but they are divisible to one стомиллионной that leaves still reserve...
The complexity of the task is also increases with the computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
The sites that provide services Bitcoin, were assaulted and биткойны were stolen from the reserves.
"the protocol used defect does not concern himself," said Pierre нуаза, who recently launched paymium - payments company accomplishing real money using Bitcoin network.
The ECB also said of the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But the cash also have this disadvantage.
The big players such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their resolve.
Recently, Adi Shamir and дорит Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accounts book and found that almost 80% биткойнов does not occur in circulation.
"the giant sales" were announced in November.
"thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," glad Jon Holmquist, working in coinabul, which deals with the conversion биткойнов into gold.
Pierre нуаза, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system paytunia, is the equivalent of the credit card (in real money) or contact-less payment via mobile phone, but she uses to verify the Bitcoin transactions, thus getting cheaper.
The owner of better control of their personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just tell the address, which can be "photograph and recognize" phone, says Pierre нуаза not to worry, that he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend revising the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"before the Bitcoin fixed, it will take some time, but the 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
In its report, the ECB suggests, by the way, to review the various risks, considered today elevated, the success of this system.

We have gone from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (каписа and суроби).
NATO and the Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its own territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, not only on us.
Us suffered mostly Afghan farmers, which we are viewed as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers and wounded and покалеченными.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign troops, as it did with the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer be as soon as the West will behave more delicately.
The withdrawal of French troops from bases ниджраб, which I watched from a Hill plantation almond trees thanks to the French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the Taliban invasion in Kabul would not.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood from the struggle between the various factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid with obscurantism of these peasants, in which their surpassed al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and nowadays.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in the position of dependence.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become dealers, exciting public lands to resell them under construction immigrants who returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontracts.
They have discredited; most of them, by the way, not even fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that was not one of the thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed to American generosity: capital outflows substantial.
The young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world while in exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its advantages.
About 65 percent of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who don't want to go back to the old мракобесию parties, no to corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which are of the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment, the Army is.
The authorities, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, ведшие anti-Soviet struggle is already taking measures to restore the provincial militias who would not abide by the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences must be to some extent децентрализован, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections, scheduled for April 2014.
But his country since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put back on its feet, none of the dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is not repaired.
All the imported; produced nothing, except vegetables and fruits.
The priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, the state control over the facilities would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
It is only strengthened the perception that Western countries were present there, only to their boss.
Without the energy for the processing of iron ore and copper on the spot, without means of transportation to their export through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese already almost left the Aynak copper deposit months, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig a huge Buddhist complex and remain the biggest employers of the province.
It is also necessary to one day similarly Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls and boys, the faculty of the French language at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win hearts and minds" and do the impossible, task of combining aid with offensive operations, "civil-military activities" under the Ministry of Defense (cimic), abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with heavy involvement of local labor, could help stem the insurgency: irrigation, Wells, drinking water, the restoration of forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and increasing the area of arable land.
What we leave on the memory of himself, having spent two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget impact would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests on the implementation of the small agricultural works emanating from local communities in Kapisa.
To get rid of uprisings, led by foreign groups, which want farmers, as I said, we need to give them a small military support, which would be good superivised and came to him directly.

Egypt's constitution heavy labor
It is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play all out.
Surprising everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final the next day.
Exactly one week ago, the head of the state Assembly has two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.
This new initiative has only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "violate this word" and "to flout the law."
In the camp of his followers believe that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
In a very short period of time, which makes the brothers to abandon the intention to explain the Egyptians text, the article after article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohamed Morsi, seems to have convinced the Egyptians vote positively, as he said in one interview with the US weekly time.
The more that call for accelerated voting is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "or you vote for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers," which is expected to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Majority of the liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, the feeling is not able to convey their views.
Representatives of the defenders of human rights, religious minorities or civil society have done the same thing.
To make the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the fellow Muslims.
It is no wonder that in most cases, the articles were проголосованы unanimously.
Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements arose around the day... time for prayers, as some members of the committee decided that the hours of the constituent assembly were improperly configured.
The text, which was yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object of the spotlight, Article 2 eventually remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi party, for whom the implementation of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would give them more rigorous application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," meet the liberals who see this as just a PR.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the constitution is going through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar advisory role, in particular with regard to verify compliance with sharia laws.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie помье, it is worrisome, since "people to make decisions that are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see a theocracy. "
Many liberals, moreover, excited by the fact that the next chancellor of the university, it seems to be far less moderate than the current.
"at the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil rights.
Most lawyers who worked on this text is not the ulama, and people with a university education, some were taught in the French system "- calms Alexis блое, who is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around the Article 220 may ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence," Ed.].
And in the future may question how civilian judges competent to decide about this. "
In addition to their religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the Republic.
Muslim Brotherhood say they have decreased compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Council of defense.
It also will not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite pleas from the Association for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider to be detrimental to the freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth prohibited insult that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are no longer speaks for the protection of women, emphasizes хеба мораеф, of Human Rights Watch.
She said the only positive element is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word that does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was to speak last night on television and protests are planned today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"the great and mighty" to Moscow over: migrants save money for language
So far, lawmakers and human rights activists argue that will give the law on compulsory language testing, the country has already emerged fraudsters selling fake certificates. "
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come 13 million migrant workers.
For the most part it is the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left at home.
Since the law came into effect on December 1, according to which each migrant will be obliged to take the test on the knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and communal services, life and retail trade.
But over time, "the promise of the Federal Migration Service," the tests will be obligatory for all visitors.
The Padres take will not only the language but also Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to verify and to see, and to extend work permits.
Exception is valid only for the citizens of those countries where English is the official language.
Do not fall under the law and the people who get успевшие certificates and diplomas on education before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, doomed and protection of the rights of
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language of Pushkin, the peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all the cities; now in Russia opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative on the introduction of testing and supported by lawmakers, and the Federal Migration Service.
But human rights activists before the law took effect, many times in the press had time to ask the question: what it is, in fact, will give?
That will change the indispensable knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the visitors?
First of all, is to meet representatives of the migration service, "this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor slavery. "
Very many say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of Russia's Federal Migration Service Office in Tajikistan Victor себелев.
The protection of their rights should begin before their departure.
The only organized recruitment system will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems are migrant workers without jobs, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, "said себелев - the future migrant is doomed to face unfair people under the guise of helping him всунут" путёвку "in a terribly close Barak, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents вкалывая on 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"at home they promise one thing and on arrival they cheated, confiscated passports, has not paid the promised wages," confirms the head of the main department of labour migration Ms Tajikistan толиб Sharipov.
Not ругайся, насяльника!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, gathered to Russia, recognised that not only do not know the language of the country in which seek, but also on their own to write with difficulty.
Of course, it's not so much their fault, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even describing primary education.
After all, their families can't even feed the children, not to mention that got them to dress, shoes and снаряжать in school.
Дорастая until adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if not with knowledge of the language, "they confess.
"you feel humiliated and shallow."
However, in respect of the law on the language of human rights activists say one important point.
The tests will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there are no status - there will be neither a test nor the subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"welcome, or outsiders no entrance."
Many of the newcomers say they get official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is the bureaucratic barriers and all the same language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization of costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
And here is false registration can be done quickly and just 1,500.
The Russian police officers know that we mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"asking for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists a citizen of Tajikistan умед хушкадамов.
"налетай not скупись, buy the painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language revealed that there are not only мигрантские false documents for registration.
Several of the "sham" certificates to pass language tests have already seized by the FMS.
Fake paper printed on a color printer.
Of course, they got new owners are not for nothing: each of the migrants brigands hoping thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
It is of more than two times more expensive procedures official test: it will cost the migrant labour in three thousand.
That the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption to "orange" could not simply buy, converge and representatives of the authorities, and human rights activists.
In the meantime, the authorities may promise guest workers who are unable to successfully undergo testing for the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, the newcomers, did not know the Russian, will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.

The Interior Ministry does not take on a market turnover of illegal weapons
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons of extremely small
Russia's Interior Ministry proposes to tighten the law against the owners of civil weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities on the recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when no victims, and the massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which hit seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the wearing травматики in public places and raise the age from which you can get a license for the weapon - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and anti-corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that the amendments to the law on the weapons will contribute to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
The network has an open letter, the authors of which - representatives of various public organizations rifle - require to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with minimal registered weapons, said of the Russian Service of the BBC lawyer-suite Vasily forest rangers.
According to statistics from the Interior Ministry, for six months of 2012 142 crimes committed with firearms, registered in bodies of internal affairs, while the total for the same period registered regularities of thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter assured that tightening legislation in the sphere of civil weapons not puts criminal to go on a "black" market.
Now, they say, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry's claim that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
"the black-market weapons updated on several channels.
The five main such channels, said a retired Colonel Victor баранец, ten years worked in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the army.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is "the army or military footprint" that is a weapon that had been stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"the weapons dragged and Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," says баранец.
This kind of "black weapons" - stolen by criminals from representatives of the security forces.
Баранец explains that this includes and gone from police warehouses, and stolen from directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal "barrels" go on sale with military warehouses.
Many of the military warehouses were frequent explosions.
"there are proven version of that part of the arsons were made specifically to cover the shortage," says the former military.
A contribution, in the words of Baranec mislead weapons manufacturers.
"now divorced private arms factory, which cannot withstand competition on the international market and thrown weapons from under the floors on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of "black" market - smuggling.
Especially many comes pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"there are their production, sometimes primitive and formed the mafia, which organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where the weapons?
The experts thought, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
The report prepared by the center in 2011, the troubled analysis and public-managerial design.
Experts analyzed the reporting of the Interior Ministry and the Rosstat, криминологическую literature and open data portals on the arms issue.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "at the hands of the officials, whose work is related to weapons," according to the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of armed conflicts, at 14% of cases occur theft at the stage production of weapons, 5% fall on "Black archaeology."
The seller-consultant of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to be identified, says the weapons found black копателями, have long been nobody buys - too old.
Most often, as he says, the new party sellers go on a military warehouse.
Through the Ensign man buys unit, for example pistol.
He was discharged her, pass through the fence.
"he carries it into the city and it sells for 900 euros per unit with two shops," says
"it is true that the police were informed of all cases, so periodically when Burns plan for solving crimes, is conducting secret purchases from merchants illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"as in the luxurious store."
The seller and buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I did on Web sites, blogs, has not yet responded comrade, who offered to come to the platform 'racing, "where is the person who Romeo me in" the corner "where we will bargain.
The price of a barrel I learned only there
Victor баранец military observer
I need to get the barrel acquaintance who has access, "says the seller-consultant." I have a friend there, but I'm not sure.
There are sellers in the markets, but there is also need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that the daughter tooth fell."
I am now even a couple of кастетов достаю through a person, which I am sure.
He also delivers them only to me, because I know that I'm not rent.
Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor баранец dabbled in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
The scheme, he said, have not changed.
He was given the album with photographs, where there was "anything."
"I felt like at the luxurious shop," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranec, does not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - we are going with the seller in the forest, there's set target.
"I was given the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that weapons beats good start bargaining," describes the procedure of the expert.
Shop on the couch
The search engines on the Internet posting on sites and groups vkontakte, where the offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
For this, do not need any documents and personal meetings.
"enough to have a certain amount of money," writes in the advertising cap on the site "buy a gun battle or machine."
The users leave their applications and asking questions.
But minors sell?
"without a license, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (sic) preserved.
"buy тт.москва" - tersely formulates the query "федоренков."
The Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of secret sites and want to buy martial weapons rowing by shovel.
People go, like a hungry fish on прикормку, and then coal mined in Siberia
The military observer and former military Victor баранец
I heard about such schemes: usually the site registered outside the actions of the Russian laws.
People accept orders.
The buyer through an ATM produces payment.
"in response, send a photo and instruction, where the hidden weapons," says spokeswoman of the public organization "right to weapons," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor баранец argues that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without arms and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service now разбросила a huge network of secret sites and want to buy martial weapons rowing by shovel.
"people go, like a hungry fish on прикормку, and then coal mined in Siberia," he said.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, we can meet the amount from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry кислова from the organization "right of weapons," Makarov can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Will have to wait for a month and a half.
He shipped from warehouses long storage management of these warehouses middle managers.
According to the official стастистике agencies, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia fell by 7% and accounted for 22.9 million, while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.

In the United States from Continental supermarkets and fast food
Through the work at the cashier at McDonald's goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages Walmart Corporation in department stores and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, "" tacos Bell, "" уэндис "and" Kentucky Fraid чикен. "
So far, no one is predicting, whether this wave in the ninth shaft or fated expire in the early stages.
Shares support the unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that receive the rank-and-file employees of Walmart and a system of fast food to protest organisers is the creation of the trade union organizations.
So far, this sector of the economy almost not covered union movement.
46 cents per year?
The shares began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday" when on America hit orgy of cheap sales with the millions of average citizens and sometimes accompanied потасовками.
On this day, some workers at Walmart, in which worldwide employs 2.2 million people have fled their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is designed for people of modest and middle-class.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, shotguns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many wage and Walmart come only at work.
The availability and the range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap partly because few pay their workers.
The latter also complain of poor working conditions, such as a shortage of trucks or hand-held scanners.
The participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
Typical employee Walmart, supress 9.5 dollars per hour, this expense does not afford, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart will raise salaries to Armenia to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the company at 3.2 billion dollars.
It is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.
If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, then every visit to the store will do them all by 46 cents more expensive.
For the year they will spend on some 12,39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of the Walmart rather noted that the protests have occurred only nine states and did not cause any damage малейщего Corporation.
"black Friday" continued into its stores from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of its cash registers produced in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The corporation spokesman Dan фогелман claimed in an interview with The Huffington Post left the site that jobs have left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was just a "stunt" another deadline-slaughtering its union.
"fund!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (their this progressive city not nicely, and therefore there is no), and McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of cabins, and after that he didn't even give you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!
Джумейн Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
At this point, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law amounts to $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants to increase over time, but only slightly, and the average of their rank-and-file workers are in New York, 8.90 dollars per hour.
Less of them in this expensive city not earns no one.
How can we exist in New York on such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once through McDonald's took place almost a quarter of American teenagers who подрабатывали for their mystery after school, living with their parents.
Few people saw it as a main source of sustenance or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I happen upon interviews with workers "макдоналдсов" who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even to feed her children.
On the other hand, at the Forum newspaper, the Wall Street Journal hangs comment, the author of the notes that irresponsible to have children, if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Participants in the protests that began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday at the McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and the fast-food cooks system began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is more than doubled their current minimum salary.
They also demanded that the fast food in the area were established trade union organizations.
U.S. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the activists of the trade union movement придирками and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration is rarely makes them life.
But embrace the Union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons.
One of the main - unusual turnover.
The dissenters
Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the action was in the middle of the Day "rally at a McDonald's near Times Square, which was organized by several local politicians Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council джумейн Williams, declaring:" McDonald's says he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even gives you a hospital and does not pay you for an honest job!. "
The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de бласио, declaring that "we must join together in support of fast-food workers so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every New York йоркец!."
As it happened, described the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast-food industry.
But it was attended by only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which New York employed tens of thousands of people.
While it is unclear whether this will produce spark the flame of the mass movement.

"as long as the fool the brain is secondary."
The popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality lately taken perceive primarily through the prism of special glasses.
First, in the summer, at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it became known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D technology laboratory in кэмбриджской Microsoft шарамом изади follows that for scientists this company points - passed.
The prospect of luring manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
"tell me, please, in general terms, what does your team?
"we are engaged in human interactions with machines, but try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, the mass of humanity stuck at the stage of work with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья finger at them.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox Kinect without today is not for sale, because all the interesting жестовое management.
"what else we lies ahead?
"despite the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction on a physical level, much still going on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of the information system (improved gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.
We are trying to change this, working on a true 3D display systems on the basis of different technologies, including проективных.
Need to release a computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, the need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell with these stupid helmets virtual reality!
"what do you think about the voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate it?
"it is definitely not a panacea - the question arises privacy because they don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought over gestures, but not over the swinging and over such parsimonious, short.
The gestures were not camera devices and наручным bracelet, which registered movement of the bones and muscles.
While he was big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wrist watches.
But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, the gesture + voice.
"it's like?
"for example, how do you ask me to give you this bank carbonated drinks?
You say and at the show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- that is, you want to get users to adapt to what may or may not at the moment, the car?
"not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future, we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that allow more accurately determine the reaction of man.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give permission for good depth, it is very important.
"if you talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, which you claim to modern cameras?
The resolution lacks the depth or something?
"in principle, the current generation is what we can build on our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it is good to get 8 megapixels at a speed of 1,000 to a / s.
But it's not the мегапикселях themselves, as well as the matrix and depth.
With the last point of view all current technologies for us is not good enough - it adds to the work of the designers algorithms.
That is, we need to remember not only about the resolution on axes X and Y, and z.
It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
The movement of the person is quite dynamic, and current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen бетишес from our рэдмондской laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between people and machines.
I would in my work is very useful equivalent of such a device, not only requires касаний to FPS was more.
"and to increase the number of cameras do not need?
"Kinect now there are three" camera, "one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second - receiver wave crest.
It is already the third luggage is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
A potentially more cameras could solve the problem.
Or exacerbate it, increasing the required amount of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible equivalent of Kinect, play with the curvature of cameras and see how it will help in 3-D determining provisions.
"as far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses.
You don't think in terms of the daily use of technology augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
"of course, all the time slob, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the steep option would be" restricted "keeps reality when the cloud-based platform you could switch with points on a smartphone, a projection screen and further everywhere.
Points are very personal device, in that their strength (private things you see only), and at the same time weakness is supplemented by reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects, together with other people.
"imagine for a minute that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony старку from" Iron Man, "but also ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which often indicate critics such an idea: no tactile feedback!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers your group is preparing to this challenge?
- in his lectures I often say that amended the reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the most interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a kind of substrate for image.
It is perfectly registers clicking!
But there are technologies that are really focused on making this "pictures in the air" Mama - for example, several electron beams ultrasound directed to a certain point where the finger, gives a sense of, but so far it is very weak - as if you're blowing on pads.
There are bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction.
"and you were trying to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at the moment when he sees something?
"it is a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.
Here is another task, which is to fight for a long time - how to make the man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - working on concepts and running tracks (not such as in clubs) moving platforms, as well as the huge balls.
While the fool the brain is secondary, the work is still very for many years.
This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so attractive to researcher - many things in absolutely infancy.

Minor complaints instead of culture - росбалт.ру
"Rosbalt" continues to project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to the townspeople, which lie ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
At the top the list of prominent figures have already entered the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national fame.
A new hero "росбалта" - a pentagram artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in red, which meets the Russian Museum, Summer Garden, then at the fort and вернисажах.
The paintings Cyril Miller always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they exhibited.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical сказочников, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller is a brilliant man of the St. Petersburg vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he is a man of his appearance on the streets calling smile among the residents, the resonance the mood.
He recently took at the hands of anything and became St. Petersburg шарманщиком as ripe for this complex role of all its богемным existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, and why do you still go through the city around the red rather than yellow or turquoise, for example?
"I chose the red color as a fashion designer who views and image.
In this world of red is a compromise between the artist, the maker and society.
Although the society all slightly not gray, causes aggression and excitement malign properties.
But my provocations aimed at began the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate.
"and when you realized that needs to be an artist?
"the exhibition at the theater Nevsky, where my works were displayed.
I realized that this is my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists took place, and the new, free like me were unclear.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with постгазоневщиной that led to the "Pushkin-10," and more waves.
I get to the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except for the words.
"and it's all merged in your art-clinic..." it was important to find themselves at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there has not been repaired, there was a musical and artistic club, bohemian Club, home of the St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: номы, tequila-jazz, remember the string led with the project, "Van Gogh's ear.
Cord and his friends sang under the plywood light songs, they were in обтягивающем tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor vdovin.
When the band played live, she became the "Leningrad."
Трахтенберг was leading many programs to Khali-галивских times.
We gave them трахтенберга, and went to his great career, and basic education and upbringing he received from us.
Gallery "D 137," the club "Griboedov is echoes from the art-clinic.
There our employees and patrons left.
Yesterday I hero of the century, when the culture of something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "the people of our city."
In the nomination "artist of the year" was named I ended my peak.
In the New Times under the old rules uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, integrity and culture of the last century.
In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"your work is characterized by recognizable manner.
"many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and poignancy.
I will be software exhibition, "the Russian Museum in клоунах."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used social was now to be this is a painful and scary.
But in клоунах smeared all the shooting tragedy.
I love the grotesque, I have a гротесковые ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by changing the totalitarian наказово.
Now meet on clothes, depending on foreign mechanics, not on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand to it and give birth to spit.
And deception will be removed with the dressing.
"but recently we saw you in the role of the urban шарманщика. - cultural city should have such a hero.
Who is not me, they have to be.
"well may and commercial art can be beautiful?
"now the commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet.
The disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people pressed in the pack, eat one loved, простаки more.
Now, all crashed on микросообщества, now it is hard to enjoy everything.
I'm not стодолларовая paper to all like.
Now need to think who will be like.
Now each of the cult hero for 100 fans.
"but on the Stas Mihaylov comes a few thousand!
"come on him брошенки there сексо-social sphere works.
But on the cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10,000 does not come, and as a result fewer management, money, everything dies.
I have fans, the main thing is they don't cheat, not spoil their possessions.
I wrote in his youth, such paintings that one collector they on the wall next to фальком and ларионовым hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now, often confuse.
They say: the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, rose by examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, abandoned the money for the sake of drawing paintings.
I am for such a culture.
- Cyril, which lacks the Petersburg?
"good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: official from the culture.
But not every one of them can do culture.
With the right tsars, all is not as it was, the Kings may not really understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts.
This is in Moscow now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg that could be the experts, but they closed because they need the higher experts who correctly appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now thrives вкусовщинка.
The same эрарта, but their distinguishes what they honestly say that not all the modern art we accept that there are some artists who must seek to other museums.
"what is for you - St. Petersburg?
"St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital of the far more culture in Moscow, where the soil is.
But on our stones art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, and we writers are now more than readers, it is wrong.
That's a lot of people in Europe любопытствующих. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We did this layer of subtle.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on the grant of St. Petersburg

Give birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with the asteroid-killer.
The caravans ships with землянами aboard go in search of extra planet.
To save humanity, raises the question of how to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact, only two of these planets that can develop at least hypothetically.
"it's Venus and Mars," said senior researcher of the National Astronomical Institute, P.K. Sternberg (presently), Vladimir сурдин.
But if the conditions on Mars more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approach to the issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
A half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations raised on orbit peas are no different from their earthly varieties.
Then, focusing on the orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies, fruit flies.
In 1979, sent into space eggs перепелок to check how the developing embryo in conditions of weightlessness.
We get at the exit is absolutely normal chick.
And then begins the problem.
"the problem is related to the fact that this nestling must find a support, he must get back on their feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute of medical and biological problems (имбп) Ras Vladimir сычев.
Not finding support, the chicks randomly rolled around.
And after 10 hours in newborns took full atrophy instincts.
The chicks not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that through four days they just died.
"and the two times we вылупляли chicks, then refused because there simply impossible to work with them," says the failure of the experiment with Birds in space, Vladimir сычев.
The last time with animals biological "миниковчег" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, experiments will continue.
However, at биоспутнике "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
It was an experiment with rats that have been sent into space with the fruit.
In principle, there is not found nothing unusual.
"it's just been on биоспутниках, but again, this is a single experiment, and such research should be conducted," said Vladimir сычев.
After landing at the space rats appeared offspring.
But the approach to the problem of reproduction directly in space.
Easy task.
The animals, losing, their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sex drive.
The man, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, and able to create an opportune emotional background.
On ethical grounds such experiments are not carried out.
But the women into space travel is already 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious that humanity, is a woman's body.
Our Chaika fled, and no one on earth could not say whether he will continue after the flight into space.
Whether she will give birth to a child after this flight.
"after all this question no one answered," says the veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang вачнадзе.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child андриян Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana савицкой, twice the orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, the son was born.
However, the risk remains.
We have a few units are astronauts who after long flights all cost, and growing at a healthy generation.
"and if more, then it is dangerous even in the orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity to look for new ways in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity.
CPC гидролаборатория - mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in the neutral buoyancy astronauts spend skills of work in outer space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If the water for adults, let and comfortable, but still alien environment for infants - native element.
Small ихтиандры seems to confirm - life on land emerged from the ocean.
There is a link between what the kid is approximately nine months from her mother at окоплодной liquid, then it is easier to get used to the water.
In principle, it is logical because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swimming, runs in just two weeks.
"it's very little to forget something," says Marina sailing instructor грудничкового pending.
In short, if a child born weightlessness more natural state, it is necessary for women - gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness дряхлеют muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, drops the ability to expel the fetus.
Oh well, redesign and it is relying on stimulants generic activities.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go into labor, she draws nigh.
"and then what?" asks trivial matters Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity.
With no sense of gravity, the body does not form a skeleton and muscular system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, put into a special load costume for training.
He simply would be deprived of what he will be essential.
"and this experiment, on which we go with the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to what we bring to the ground disability, fully дезадаптированного person," foresees the head of the Committee on bioethics имбп Ras Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space - the question of the theory.
However, after a while, it will be a reality, when the Earth's population on their ships go on a faraway planet, which will become home to their descendants born in space.

The head of the unregistered governance: checking Schwartz-system failed at the hands of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good body control and, despite the availability of quality legislation lags behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security Audit Department, from the interview for the site aktuálně.cz.
"the law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we are not enough," commented on the current situation Kala.
Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of the improper practices cited Peter нечаса approach to the so-called Schwartz-system.
Recently, the prime minister said the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - it is banned or permitted?
"the law should be established in any way, and if he does something, then the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the institutions, which compelled to check and to fulfill their commitments," states the feces.
At a meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies have you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which was compared the legislation on procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
A parallel test that we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, the question that European law says how should receive public procurement, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All the information was gathered and, even if there is still unfinished verification, revealed the interesting differences - simply put, the legislation we may be "accurate and unmistakable," but in practice we have some parameters behind Germany.
It follows that not enough to create more and more detailed rules need to focus on the application of the law.
But actually, as this project can help you what it means for you?
This is the joint control may contribute to efforts to stop refining laws, reduce and improve the restrictions because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy means getting the appropriate thing for reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit orders.
Perhaps this system переполнится "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the limit is not declined.
You're talking about the internal problems of the practical application of the legislation on procurement.
But as a system of control in Germany?
Is there a such an organization like ours KRU (control-ревизионное management) or it works differently?
As for the institutions, then there as our Kru is the bundesrechnungshof, arranged according to our principle, there is also a board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the powers similar to a certain extent, but because Germany has a federal structure, then there is a division of the audit and at the level of federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours.
Brh could manage only the federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal registration chambers.
As for the local law, there is easier than we?
In general, I would not want to compare without concrete evidence, but in some respects Germany can take a sample, but you can't definitely say that it is better at everything.
This is so because they are better at dealing with control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But I have to say that even the main countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
Speaking about the domestic legislation, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments are quite short, she still had not surfaced in our work to control.
Since we spend control in fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
Take it into account only in the process of preparing the future inspections - we started to use our new instrument "risk detection неэкономности" through which we turned away almost 14,000 state contracts. "we analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will increase because the change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tender and so on.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of the bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it is confirmed.
The problem that may arise, is that the rules "ужесточатся" and it will be impossible to observe.
During the action of the previous rules controlled entities are related to the supplier (for example, Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) is that any violation of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in this case, the enforcement of the law in this way?
I think that is not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit formal error, not influencing the decision.
Such a system will only create even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
And then to get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the prime minister said the GDP will not disturb entrepreneurs checks of the so-called Schwartz-system. "what does it mean?
"Schwartz-system" is banned or permitted?
The law should be established in any way, and if he does something, then the Prime Minister could not resist the work of the bodies, which compelled to check and to meet its obligations.
You can say: "we will apply this law and allow it," but you can't say that we will pretend as if nothing happens.
The law on public procurement contains a fairly strict rules on how and what must formally take place, and it is the right thing. It protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we are not enough.

In some places, the Czech Republic and snow-covered roads frozen.

Shimon орнест: at the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than a month should come the end of the world?
It's just one of the many disturbing news, on which we humans so easily попадаемся.
Together with a group of the tap tap we kidding on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to raise enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three shows at the end of the world.
Could you please tell us about this readers?
We are talking about a national event to raise money, which we plan now for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, which declared the end of December 21, at 11: 10.
The day before the event, 20 December at 21: 00 parallel start three shows in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at a time when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone for 12 hours earlier than we will end May calendar.
Who came to mind this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, then we are all up together with our artist гонзой Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to amass enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to, together with the public think about where the world once we pass on to our children.
To mark the end of the calendar may we have created a unique collection of items from the shoes, shirts, bags and original ключиков against Doomsday. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thereby also give us support.
The group tap tap, together with other musicians sang the national anthem at the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
Whether listeners already fancied YouTube anthem on these бенефисных concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will come and the end of the world will not come.
His запоют all performers on all concerts at the same time.
Both anthems ring also live broadcast of the Czech television.
The words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomas ганак, participates in the performance also xindl X...
Do you have begun to cooperate with them?
We will also cooperate with other boys Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.
Try to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many would like to work with us, they were interesting.
The proceeds from the concert will go against the end of the world?
The purchase of equipment for безбарьерного studeo educational center, now in its sixth year, so we are working with civil association едлички tap at the Institute.
The teachers regularly attend school students едлички Institute and spend with them funny and interesting events.
The students themselves have no money to go to the teachers, and thus we are trying to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the additional construction едлички Institute in the future there will be a separate building in which we moved to this project.
At every concert will address several musical groups and performers.
What were the criteria for selection?
We have tried to draw up a program that interested in all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Bart, the Tap Tap, Marjan банго and Jiri сухи.
About all the details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan to any such "grandiose events" in the future?
For the first time in May, will perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, to prepare a programme with interesting guests.
Next year, we would be happy to have representation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are going in the United States, I would like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
Group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road in terms of organisation and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five players on electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the cargo area, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with instruments.
However, so far to deal with this without problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways have always been well prepared for us that surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to the выездам abroad you can compare the different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled and so on.
With what you encountered to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything works better than we have in Russia, we have seen that in the East still is on a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow so many barriers, and here is still in the Bieszczady independent movement of people on an electric wheelchair at the center of the city.
There is also not in the course of such banal things like give way disabled in an elevator.
Fortunately, and there already are public organizations that are trying to draw the attention of the people on the problems of people with disabilities.
But what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are so many things, the level of performance which far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the development and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid quite normal that people with severe disabilities move on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, yes anywhere...
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities are active in public life, and in this we tap tap them with the slightly ahead!
The respect of the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment when will appear among US athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything and really start to change.
While it is isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The group tap tap is currently very popular, but back on two years ago that in 1998 you caused her to organize?
I entered the institute едлички as a teacher, I had a lot of young people who wanted something to do.
And since I am a musician and play the saxophone, together with a colleague organized an interesting music circle.
Well, and over time, says our leading ладя ангелович, it's a bit out of control (laughs).
The popularity of the same came only in recent years, or I have something steps?
It is true, we help that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on advocacy group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can estimate, essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the European Union funds we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
The goal stood in front of you so well turn the tap tap?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, подражающей one another.
It is logical, all new taken with caution, and lasts that long.
There is very little rare things, but I dare say that the tap tap one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, a pity, it is natural...
But this pity completely излишня because people with disabilities are not suffering any and all the abandoned personalities whom we should pity.
They are the people who can live productive lives and develop, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities something happens, this shift, not only for them, but also for the whole society.
Lee ensured the success of what you strict head of what many believe you?
If we want to do the job properly, we must be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that it is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they must go to rehearsals, attend the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, as part of the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them were at the beginning of 1998?
Only one ладя ангелович.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and the will, our doors are always open.
He will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held at the stadium in Prague Incheba, in Brno and Ostrava fléda - the club is at the center of the plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert all three cities are joined телемостом at the time of the performance of the group's songs tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."
The aim of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for purchasing multifunctional безбарьерного equipment for educational center studeo when едлички Institute in Prague.
Ticket on the concert is worth 400 kronor, for children under 12 years of free entrance. Tickets can be bought in advance at bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and for years took an active part in a number of projects agency.
But the path to the space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the second world war, the Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, about the lecture A. штернфельда that December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "introduction to космонавтику."
The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Jan гадомский was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France штернфельд won the prize of Robert эсно-пельтри and Andre Luiz хирша for "introduction to космонавтику."
Dr. Jan гадомский (1899-1966) mentioned above, later became a great propagandist astronomy and space exploration.
He published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books on this scientific disciplines.
Гадомский became known worldwide propagandist space exploration, and his contribution was estimated by the fact that one of the craters on the back side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway дрезина equipped missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear even to disperse or to pull carts would be used rocket.
Information about this дрезине known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to wonder about the missile стрелах.
The study conducted weapons technology section in cooperation with professors мечиславом вольфке and Gustav мокжицким.
Of the remaining material shows that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops were interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized printing an idea фотоэлектрической missiles and fighter, which offered рогозинский engineer, and the next year published work "aerial rocket-powered aircraft and rocket-and-bomb" author леливы-кживоблоцкого.
Both projects were developed for military use of missile engines.
Before the war all projects of the military use of missile technology was a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), who coordinated the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work by the end of the start of the war.
The next scientific work dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish media after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of the Journal of 1954, "problems" in which four voluminous published articles on астронавтике.
In one of them, Professor M. суботович offered to organize a society that will be космонавтикой.
At the time, had already increased projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.
Since the start of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ooa) attempted to join the International Federation Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn ooa became its full member.
The next year, the first chairman of the ooa Kazimierz заранкевич (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956 ooa contributed to the development of a highly successful meteorological rockets RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, выполнившей scientific study.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
Rocket capable of overcoming the distance 1800 m, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, was built enhanced version of the RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959, on vacant бледовском were conducted tests of the two-stage rocket RM-2.
The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do this scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome the 14.5 kilometers, and its task was monitoring the rise by the wind.
But in 1962, the further development was suspended.
Heiress RM became the first missiles missile meteor-1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.
The rocket was conceived as a stage, its total length was 51 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
The three were developed type (marked as a meteor-1A, -1в and -1с) who were split by the size of the cameras for scientific equipment.
Missile meteor-1A had space with 0.4 liters, meteor-1B - 0.34 liters and meteor-1C - 0,62л.
The maximum range from all three types of was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 for years in the Aviation Institute was developing missiles meteor-2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Missile meteor-2 with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring the cargo weighing 10 kg at a height of about 60 km.
Then were built version of the meteor-2н and meteor-3.
We should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the establishment of a national committee COSPAR two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the intercosmos, Poland participated in studies of outer space for the Soviet-made satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir ремека.

The repeal of the law on public works is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The decision sparked a heated discussions in society.
Of course, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that a separate economic units, national economies, are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, no limited movement of private capital, together with unruly financial speculation.
As a result of the significant differences in the cost of labor (wage) raises the price pressure.
Under this concept, you need to understand the condition when the producer through the delivery of cheap goods tries to weather the economic competition "misleading" cost competitor to pick up a larger share of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a massive scale, it means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries where the cost of labor, compared with other, high.
Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including unemployment and for them, the inevitable growing state spending on social needs.
On the whole, the situation reinforces the unwillingness of the gentlemen of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the social, economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it does not need to give specific statistics.
Бесцеремонные methods of private capital to create economies at the level of individual states situation when governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the governments of their own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This reflected primarily in changes of the current legislation.
The goal is to make your Aquapark Aquapark people obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the areas of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labor law.
As a result of the rising level of poverty, and at the same time, and the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor who are not able to feed themselves own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching one million.
As part of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occurring cases when employed people receive a salary that the state should they mention that they have received a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all of the southern states of the EU will undoubtedly lead to the same end, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on the poverty-level wages on the margins of society in the hope that the country will come the private investment capital.
However, the question is, where he will undertake?
If the capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for the European share of wages.
It concerns all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in the actions of the management of the economy.
The following is to answer the question is not whether the private capital, now practically managing politics and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?
With a resounding "yes.
The proof is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result we have a hopeless situation, an emerging of corruption, ensuring mutual benefits, in the legislation, where almost everyone deserves punishment, but not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the public ministry due to lack of financial resources electrical design bills private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.
Then these bills approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution, and from the financial-powerful groups who prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal-oriented democracy now quickly turns in such an aquapark Aquapark situation as described аппианом at work, "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "the state has long been disintegrating, and agencies are responsible for the violence.
The bribes, illegal obtaining no favours with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any taboos, and people went to vote with pre-sold voice, "" decent people never ran for the post of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without the consul "...." seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this terrible situation is an autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic man.. "аппиан thought that it would be a Pompey, but they became Caesar, who had replaced the democracy of autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless without taking into account the interests of the public interest.
Private capital is already at its core is not intended for use in public purposes.
Today's result is not different from the past: unparalleled decline of the elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.
It means the cause of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy such as can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next tour.
Above all, the tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social growth.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is to target the political and social reforms that would strengthen the state's contribution to the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and private capital will weaken monopoly position in society in favor of the state.

Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"the violence will not, and can never go out," the Sting, "fragile," where the main verse рефрена are the words: "do not forget what we are fragile."
"if my sons did not want war, they would not have been" - a moribund goutelle шнапер, wife меера амшела Rothschild.
The recent wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused a broad response.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position because he has the right to defend itself, and the Palestinians as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel was attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who these periodically repeated waves of killings - the perpetrator and victim, in the end, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not been witnessing the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, look at who primarily serve continues for 95 years of tension (apart from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning supported by historical facts, some of them taken on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all, the story of the struggle for power.
In every time we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people are taking their own steps or for their throne was someone who guided their actions to a pre-set goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and arising out of them, the authorities could not for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be regarded as the head of the octopus (don't know whether someone over them, but it is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
Many of them did not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s, the 19th century to stop the rumors connecting their name with criminal actions in the highest spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and who have always led to consolidate their power, the growth of wealth or both, and to another.
They are significant equity stakes in almost all of the central banks of the world, and against the countries whose central banks do not have its share, they lead or prepare the war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries after the overthrow of Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the central bank of the Russian government took his country into their own hands.
Anyone who tried to resist this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to produce their own (понимай) - government money and was assassinated in 1865, in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis макфадден was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their hunger for a world power in the period from 1859 until the 1871 year led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created by the great Mason 33-Albert пайком.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially Britain, and a third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (of so many slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be other than as a precondition for such a project) and final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which the working group of the richest families headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao - order out of chaos.
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, which was to prevent a recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war, by the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne габсбургского Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the tsarist Russia's Bolshevik революциию.
The first world war ended sudden, economically untenable in the military and the surrender of Germany (already there was no need for a war for the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and, as a consequence, the fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the second world war, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations than created the premise to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then remained the only spark Germans sufficiently strong, обличающего perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, sparking the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century Rothschilds provoked the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Jews with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion).
Above the Balfour Declaration created the premise for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, began to happen the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler extricated himself from the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or all he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was triggered by the military репарациями on 2-World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed in order to create the hearth of the War of the third.
If international bankers will manage to untie the Jewish people, like in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now, together with the Arab or, simply put, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only domestically but also internationally (to take only the sharp divide people on the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence if it all started with the greed of individuals and their quest for world power?
Here we need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections for their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of the fascist, loyal to the international bankers politician, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into world conflict, and given Iran's control over the latter chokepoint containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) - also will lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Now, in light of the manifest words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: "all we need is a general crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
The new world order in their view is the World Masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy, наслаждающейся comfort.
World where everyone born body at birth имплантируют chip, with whom he becomes a creature who is under total control.
"and makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slave to have on the right hand or forehead stigma, so that the man, who has not been marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
Here's what wisdom: everyone who have the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
Because it is the name of the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.

The film "operation" Argo ": when the worse, call the Hollywood
In November 1979, demonstrators crowd of Islamist students captured the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled after the revolution in the United States, which have been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
The US administration for the positive outcome of the situation is not productive - she could not afford to throw the Shah overboard because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not in a condition.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced an abortive attempt to free the hostages by force.
The prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days after talks mediated by the government of Algeria.
Their fate has caused home a wave of solidarity and антииранских sentiment.
Defeat in Iran has largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, leading to the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, срежессированный actor Ben Affleck's "operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history that has brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of six workers managed to escape.
After some serious troubles they finished their way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them from Iran, helped cover extravagant legend, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as members of the journalists, подыскивавшие in place for the filming of science-fiction epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded the cooperation of Hollywood.
The legend was true, in specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, was to hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film аффлека is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film-киноопус," the story of a successful venture, the scam - example may be a series of films about friends оушена.
In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, the documentary conceived scenes from Tehran (the credits to show significant historical photographs of events and how the same situation were shown in the film - the large differences in this not).
On the other hand, the light Hollywood passages, the overlapping with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits are discussing the situation at the tables of negotiations on the staircases institutions on the phone...
Ben аффлеку remarkably managed to make рестарт career.
The actor высмеянного became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"operation" Argo "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, baby, Goodbye "(2007) and the thriller" The Town "(2010).
At the same time, it is the first film аффлека, who has not appeared in the director's hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place it refers to the qualities that have heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.
Affleck and it shows in "Argo" where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive for its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of the confusion and непредвиденности that arise when it suddenly changed history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at a Tehran Bazaar).
Far too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not imply many exciting scenes cinematic values.
He is quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something further elaborated - there's all this goes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Chase on a runway look pretty farfetched).
The downside of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as the Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they're in the film is far from the only.
The film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, this is a movie that you can watch with moderate interest, assessing the performance and retro-style, recreating 1970s thrillers.
But captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated notions about Almighty and всезнающих security services.

The rules inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com annually conducts the survey about the most absurd bank fees, now decided to announce the competition for "the most absurd judgment or the project from the workshop of the EU."
"we made the last event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of the large European companies," said "law" organizer Patrick нагер questionnaire.
Among the already forward for the nomination абсурдностей - the recent decision by the European court of unification of the premium rates for men and women.
So far, the women have benefits for life insurance, because for insurance companies they objectively are less vulnerable.
"further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU, people can advance to the contest until the end of this year.
The vote will be held before the end of February 2013, "said нагер.
The EU's controversial orders include, for example, and compulsory Rekreacji Sp adding fuel to that as a result of the harms nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive or the size of the cages for chickens, eggs rose significantly this year.
Also criticized was de facto ban on the use of the term "бутербродное butter" or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs.
High-quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
Pan-European unit often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose position in Brussels is usually protected by any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even under threat of the veto asserts claims its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, the highest quality bananas in the EU were to reach 14 cm in length and did not dare show "unusual curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission is justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing piecemeal national rules that are complicating trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states still softened standards concerning the fruits and vegetables, recalling that the existing directive will lead to расточению products.
Candidate to win in the poll may become and last year's ruling by the EU, according to which sold balloons must contain a warning that children under eight years could not finagle their without adult supervision.
The EU has asked the American research, according to which the balloons in the game are potential causes of death by suffocation.
That restriction now applies to children under 14 years old, which is prohibited blow at the trade fair дуделки.
Funny ideas are born and at home
It is quite absurd and rule concerning the European officials themselves: anyone who has the EU any official position, cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should instead talk "FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of non-interference" (laissez faire), offered to vote, apart from a few above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule of the amount of food on the territory of the membership of the state.
The EU imposed the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic has exceeded, for example, established by the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a fine.
Organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in the idea of pay and some countries for what they don't have sea, and the idea is to provide subsidies for the subsidies.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.
"we are at a disadvantage, because we don't have the sea.
Ask the European Union for compensation, "he said in the fall of 2004, then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he pointed out that the country was a grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying the state had the full warehouses stocks that it was necessary to take out.
For the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to паласу, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, arranging a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages, the Ministry of Regional Development Minister Paul -led German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: bizarre orders are the exception
Although the resolution in member states can easily become the target of criticism, the efforts of the EU on regulation, as well as more effective operation and Development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved when discussing the budget.
Evokes emotions among the Czechs and the fact that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians retained the name "оломоуцкие curds," but "туземский rum," a tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename on "туземак."
Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beets.
The official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "горгондзола" марципаном from German Luebeck or Parma ham, has already proved, for example, Karlovy Vary enough погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий hops.
The EU also trademark can be proud пардубицкий carrot and горжицкие tubes.

People want me to guarded Republic, but I'm a fan, "said окамура.
Mr. senator, as a man comes to mind to run for president?
I don't think about to become a senator or president.
If we in the country all functioned without problems, then I'm not running.
But I can't watch over the past 20 years, the country разворовывается as thieves scurrying around here, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like it, then trying to find a solution, as it change.
And since I have already turned forty years and I am an independent person, not belonging to any party, I don't have another opportunity to influence things but to run for the post of senator or president.
You have got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential palace.
So whether you do not turn back to the people who you choose?
I always said that включусь in the struggle for the presidential Castle, depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.
Later, I said that if I am elected senator, will run for the presidency.
My goal is not a position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
So I need the greatest influence and vast powers.
But the problem is not only that we as a nation have ропщем himself in a bar or watching television, but willing to trample anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this, the media that person очерняют and confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, I was told that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri пароубека.
Go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential Castle you started with a thesis about the material and criminal liability of politicians and the back of property declarations to the tune of more than 20 million.
To do it, you need to change the law.
You as the president has no such authority, and only the whole Senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct tours became free enterprise, it managed to advance.
The problem is playing politics - when someone comes with a good offer on the left or right, he deliberately thwarted, and it holds citizens.
As an independent беспартийного person I have a much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no party раскладывания through, without looking at the tenets can take each party, what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left?
The Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to the left.
For me it is not important - a little bit to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
The question is not about whether someone belongs to the right and to the left, I want to unite people.
I always support any good for society, whether it will offer hrcm or GFC, and I'm just going against the bad ideas.
You are angry when someone says you populist.
But does not prove whether you are what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some good goals and views.
And for that you are trying to get closer.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals that I am already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.
But without the support of the parliament will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics you did not hold on.
Or do you think that when you get to the people and talk to them, then you will realize the criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other opportunities.
Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them on their side, so that we have achieved the.
If I was elected president, then it would not be a problem to organize direct TV broadcasting, in which I will appeal to the president of the parliamentary parties to legitimize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of failure, will have to explain why it does not want.
If there is a strong personality that makes the abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was due to pressure from the public.
Say directly that I'm a lover, not a genius and not intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for its programs will try to get the support of the majority.
Things I'm trying to promote themselves; if it is not able to finish in six years and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as if окамура must save the Czech Republic.
No I'm not the Savior.
I know the one I didn't make it, so I visited a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to радиму янчуре, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
Also I at least supported the leading investigative journalist Jan лоренцову, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward his candidacy because people really were dissatisfied, but now I feel myself on the scale.
Sixty percent of people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose members of the establishment.
Only two of us independent in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for direct elections for mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of their own party?
I haven't thought about it, because I don't have time to check the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I don't have the money.
No money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroons.
You don't have the money?
You're talking about property declarations, but what about your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague, worth approximately 25 million apartment on a 10 million, another apartment at 8 million, the collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Skoda white per million, and even a few million on the account.
By the way Aston-Martin for me because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was a gallant with women and at the same time fought against the meanness and lawlessness.
You travel to Aston-Martin, the owner of the property on 60 million and you don't have the money for the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but their own money to invest in it does not want.
It is not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million on the campaign.
I have to get into debt?
The campaign, I have already invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign out of pocket.
The cost of the campaign I essentially will cover сенаторская salary.
But on this money, I would not have lived, for example, could not pay the son for English school, which is worth 30,000 monthly.
If I wanted to just make money, so there would not be running.
So, the next you will be doing business in order to live?
Don't you say that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck.
As I promised, I partially reduced its activities.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will become my deputy.
People would like that I was бессребренником, which will keep the Republic.
But I also need to something to live.
How much, as an entrepreneur, you're used to receive monthly?
Between 200 and four hundred thousand that get and further.
And if I became president, his business would be finished.

The architects MVRDV argue that the real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example спейкениссе and his newly constructed book Mountains - 2 photos
"I think this building fun, it looks футуристично, finally we once again you can see something interesting," says Lizette верхайг, прохожая on the edge of the road.
But Stefan спермон, an IT specialist at the nearby large enterprise, said: "no, it's the building really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we today, another library?
Everyone has the Internet, the iPad and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily do not go to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Спейкениссе, малопримечательному спальному campus near Rotterdam, belongs to the unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To deal with this unfortunate fact several years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges depicted on euro notes, in the form of richly painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here!
Blame the Meuse from Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold столбчатых diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual unflappable, appeared at an audition in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked puzzled and winked, sassy Meuse stepped down from his original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in defense of his project with the words: "dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "book Mountain" in спейкениссе, the so-called букенберг!
Nine years later, this mountain of $30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several nearby houses and townhouses in a total of 50 flats.
In early November, "the book Mountain" was awarded the second prize competition "The best library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition wooden structures of 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, who could not offer nothing but postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely town hall, the white facades of which suggest a молокозаводе became richer than the one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing - спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural facilities.
The long road to the book
The first impression: repetition of Eldorado under Egypt for cheese.
There is only one elevator that takes place in the center of the mountain, because the real fans of architecture and reading would prefer to explore the area on foot.
Остекленное from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of baked bricks and elegant street lamps unerringly creates a sense of public town square.
The urban environment is recreated.
View unwittingly looking benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"usually the bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is a big dark hall, typically a comfortless and faceless," says the blame Maas.
We have set the classic configuration of space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space book mountains used skillfully: at the center of the offices, the online library, chess club, Environmental Center and technical areas.
Particularly pleasing black bookshelves that serve the finish of the walls, then парапетами, лестничными railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell of unusual.
Even the sophisticated architects and engineers lost at guessing what the unknown material.
"we are eager to work with secondary materials," explains Joop трауборст, head of the project, representing the community спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
A thin textile serves one or two of the season, then it can be throwing.
The library for this painting - for the first time in such quantities - was спрессовано panel of four centimetres thick.
Under the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, according to smell a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
The top of the lead 105 steps.
Anyone who breaks the path length of nearly 500 meters, will be rewarded at the literary cafes not only a fantastic views of the city, but also the Dutch крокетами and baptized фикусами in pots.
They care about the environment, and primarily about the proper humidity on literary grief.
The cost of a new soul
"it's hard to believe, but it is building, despite plenty of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology," says троуборст.
It is used for heating and cooling warmth of the Earth.
Although the book Gore is under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.
Large farms from laminated wood, placed perpendicular to the glass case, provide shade and take up most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room a very pleasant.
The rest of the protection provide fully automatic roller-blinds.
Stefan спермон, mentioned earlier skeptic from the IT sector, has already visited the new library.
Lizette верхайг also was already here.
And also teaches traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia богард, which called the "soul букенберг спейкениссе, which has long lacked."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from the permanent collection.
These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves is still not fully staffed libraries - at that time it was 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are laden top.
"there is nothing worse than полупустая library," says the architect blame the Meuse.
"I think that thanks to our invitation now each resident in some way connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task that at a professional jargon called the creation of identity.
Спейкениссе wrote his literary history.
And if they are very young and uneducated.
It is only the starting point for building identity.

Szabo: "the Germans must play a more important role."
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on the narrow the diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinian application for observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why? "
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the U.S. position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence is not speaking too critical against Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the introduction of the forbidden zone for flights.
As a result, NATO has conducted this proposal.
Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The thing is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, led by the United States, with the German foreign policy.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent uniform policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.
I believe that as long as they only track their role, but we are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which is France or Britain.
So what exactly does "normal" foreign policy with the German point of view?
It is the willingness to hold the position in their national interest unaffected by the position of the United States or the European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are largely different from the interests of other large states, and why Germany must defend its interests.
Influenced whether these economic interests at the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the states of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not take it too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining from making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even the United States dominated the understanding of the German position.
So I don't think that it was the same dramatic надлом, both in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps even Germany will thus a certain respect.
It is signaling that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that with its interests must be considered.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly favours a veto.
Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European states?
On the strength of the American domestic politics such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration at heart has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in connection with the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly hold such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion is not so significant, as it always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, I notice that Obama is not Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not.
So they cannot act as part of a wider approach and have to instead to act on its own vision of the situation.
This is how they come with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany, it is not easy, at least because of their links with Israel.
The issue has always been a sensitive.
But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not whether she would take a really major role?
Or is the leading role still struggled Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to this, she still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far has always struggled to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - when Germany takes an important role, lends itself to a variety of boycott feelings.
The Germans are not just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a more precarious position than the United States.
It should take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
So, the influence of the United States in European politics continuously weakens, but at the moment, the EU is not fill this vacuum, then who is?
The Germans simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like, unpleasant or strengthens the dislike for you - that's life!

"the protection of trademarks in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is the world-famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is the Armani polo?
It is officially registered in China, the name that has nothing to do with companies, on which it was founded.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be the case.
But even then, it is unclear whether they defend their rights.
"foreigners is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas паттлох, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights to trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
Имитаторам enough to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci, Lu-Gucci, Prada instead can be registered Prada-kny.
The same way legally copied by German companies, such as sporting goods maker Puma.
Паттлох opens the folder with records office registration of trademarks in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trademark Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, which is also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
What the Chinese are world champions, copied and violation of intellectual property rights, known.
In big cities have a multilevel department stores that sell almost exclusively of forgery.
However, no such cases паттлоха. On behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese companies is officially received from the agency the right to use the name of the registration of trademarks, which is already protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban минпай," Mark-passenger.
The word is associated with "ban дакуань."
The so-called the women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the guilt
"it damages the business, with this, we must fight," convinced паттлох.
"while the brand, the unique position is lost, the image wobbles precipitously."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China with sales of 15 billion euros a year is the third-largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
But achieving the removal of dubious records in the register of trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Паттлох tells about the cases in which the court dismissed several claims, because after a long time опротестованное name became "the reality of the market."
If the complainant not lucky, he will have to pay even плагиатору as damaged his trade sign in China, says паттлох.
Sometimes is ruled by law of the jungle.
There is also the famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009, the company Daimler lost a court dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, Enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired-manufacturer Putzmeister concrete.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star.
Geely bought Volvo company initially used the blue-and-white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion goods maker Lacoste имитаторам lost in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of trademarks ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties.
But last year was "the return of the emergency situation in the working process to normal."
Thus, the amount of untreated cases on objections decreased by 22 percent.
Such cases were closed nearly 140 millon, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the FBI.
With this is expensive
As very often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
It is a record and means that China is the tenth consecutive topped the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011, it paid $1.8 billion yuan fees.
If we simplify, it means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Her appeal is worth many times more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group is fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to achieve what the illegal production of counterfeit auto parts has been defeated.
However, the simulator cemented its Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
It was his own omission, because the names in Germany are not subject to the protection, says hanno вентцлер, chairman of the board of Freudenberg chemical setting in Munich.
And the registration of trademarks ctmo мюнхенцев rejected the claim.
However, in both of the following sets Freudenberg won, but the stronger side continues to struggle so far.
Need to be on guard
Now, the question is pending in the Supreme Court.
Вентцлер hopes to bring the case to a good finish and praised the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "the process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
Domestic spending is unlikely to yield accounting, the archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago, to give evidence.
Five years ago, vain Freudenberg suggested the opposite party "greater шестизначную amount in Euro" for a settlement.
"this makes it clear how expensive it is to us," says вентцлер.
The danger of the Far East threatened to break even in Europe.
But if the simulators register there the unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this unable to prevent the registration.
"we need to be vigilant," says вентцлер.
As he and the lawyer паттлох recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international law on the protection of trademarks, most foreigners should be "all in any way is worth protecting, the Register also in China," says вентцлер.
Otherwise, it can do much more expensive than the registration.
Indeed, if the Freudenberg loses in the last act of the drama of the commercial sign, it will have to pay the adverse party licensing fees for its own name, explains вентцлер.
Otherwise, we will push the market in the dark segment.

World AIDS Day: притоптывать, sing, to help
The choir is rehearsing in Heidelberg имбонги - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relations, overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers.
At first heard stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, pumps ladies and gents wear slippers паркетном rhythm on the floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that slowly growing voices of singers - Alt, the bass, the tenor and soprano - they occur, enchant and follow each other.
And фите хопф, 29-year-old conductor, almost gets out of their матерчатых shoes when leads them flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology in Heidelberg имбонги choir rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir rehearsal came from 23 to 69 years old, from специалистки on human genetics to Porter.
"om" обани "is no easy thing, every voice choir has its text, also on a completely prima facie alien language: зулусском spoken eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some parts.
Self help for
According to the evaluation of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS, in the world there are about 34 million HIV-infected.
A 23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa.
In Swaziland has 245 000 orphans of AIDS.
The more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of эситжени Association voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend school, готовящую to further training.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo-center.
The имбонги зулусском language means narrator or восхвалитель.
In this hall is not fluent in the Bantu, but know how to sing.
Nearly ten years choir разучивает songs on this another soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first emerged: South Africa.
After all, at a distance from хайдельберга 8733 kilometers of the summer, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland is эситжени village, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent of the infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the virus -ic.
The эситжени in miniature reflected the disease only Swaziland: the highest levels of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, among the population is almost not accepted.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland's population are the human immunodeficiency virus, the death in the middle of the fourth ten is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants имбогни saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only of parental care, but just barely: food, clothing, education.
Without the school education a person in a poor country, there is no chance at all.
At first it was a private commitment of individual participants - a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get hot meals.
But a year later, the choir founded the Association "voices for Africa," which has since almost professionally takes care of orphans of AIDS in эситжени.
The facts about the infections, sexually transmitted
What are the most important disease, sexually transmitted infections?
Attributed to the bacterial STDs syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (триппер).
Frequent viral infections are HIV, the human папиллома-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Лобковый педикулез and scabies belong to паразитарным STIs.
What are the main поражаемые group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
Among heterosexual adults commonly seen diseases in sexually transmitted infections are хламидийные infections, трихомониаз, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human папиллома-virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections in this group.
Among the youth хламидийные infections are significantly more often than among other groups.
According to European sources, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We among young people also often found human папиллома-virus.
As changing the number of infections?
Not all of the disease, sexually transmitted infections are subject to compulsory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007, declining.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
It is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?
When infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, the complaint during urination, selection, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, as well as the bubbles or sealing.
But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Partly because agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and through close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular inspection, especially when you need to change sexual partners.
The early diagnosis can be cured most STIs and avoid the remote consequences.
Patronage, donations and not least royalties for the choir performances throughout Germany allow something to gather.
"all we sent to эситжени already about 200 000 euros," says аннете леннартц, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany manages цодва Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She also cares about orphans were well-designed, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Гогос as called on зулусском older women, it is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to yourself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over his head and take care of the children in the form of every day to appear on lessons.
Those who did not go home, go to the shelter to ханийсиле, lonely woman, receives a salary from the association, as well as two поварихи that every day is preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association "voices for Africa" organized Sewing School, built two henhouse and jointly with the American Health Organization PSI organized surrender analysis for HIV for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about a disease that is so evident in the entire country, prefer deep silent.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says аннете леннартц, "because he is linked to sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The black Africa's last absolute monarch, King мсвати III, known for his love of largesse.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, the Chinese state-style of life also blame for the virus and spread so quickly in recent years.
But it is also a stray workers, which carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, аннете леннартц says, "but they almost do not use.
Another culture - the flesh to flesh. "
A little to support the cultural exchanges, the choir ибмогни every two to three years, is traveling to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale and confidence and black identity that many on the southern edge of the black continent know since the days of apartheid.
The bus full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that happened, provoked tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip also always leads to эситжени where singers attend the sponsored children.
Despite the fact that the little village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the Valley of the river эцулвени she more than known.
"go to the эситжени, there is light," said local people.
And after 8733-mile flight back to Heidelberg, when топающие singers return to репетиционный бергхаймер facilities on the street, you can see that this light burns also here.

Liveperson: NASA opens the ice at Mercury
"the probe messenger" found evidence that the planet Mercury is the ice.
The thickness of the ice sheet may have up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is the closest to the sun, there is also a frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
"the probe messenger" found evidence that is located in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes with a comet or asteroid confronted with the mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, "said chief scientist Sean Solomon probe.
The temperature at Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how the water and other building blocks of life transferred to other places in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots, for example, "Phoenix" to explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they are sent to Earth images: small windows in endless Dali.
The image comes from the camera, which was developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, under the new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the infrared Spitzer telescope "snapshot" is "family Portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, more difficult to identify at star circle of pink "newborn" stars.
This region звездообразования неромантично - scientists call it W5, Spitzer telescope "opened" in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent glow of the dying star photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope. "
Like a doughnut ring consists of material that star threw in the process of dying.
The giant nebula трифид, remote at 5,400 light-years from Earth, from the gas and dust new stars.
NASA's Spitzer telescope "has made this picture galactic maternity Hall.
Starry constellation Pleiades, also called the "Seven Sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope colors are better.
As the red-eye winks observer nebula snail on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation Aquarius.
Resemblance to the earthly continent has brought this nebula nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an emphatic colour reproduction.
This new star in the whole beauty managed to photograph the only with the help of the Spitzer telescope infrared sensor. "
Saturn and its rings: how they have is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it is the pieces of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope ": the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color images of the spiral galaxies turn into all works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory photo shows the remote for a few thousand light years трифид Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word трифид trifidus (трехдольный, трехраздельный), as the dark streaks of dust is divided into three parts раскаленное heart cradle of stars.
Formation astronomers photographed harbinger of the cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the kernel of the two merging galaxies rush towards each other and will inevitably face.
This is the birth of stars of the Hubble telescope "took off in a spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical cuts may call it, nicknamed "the Southern цевочное wheel."
Photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope, "shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation цефея.
Nebula, remote 1,400 light-years, is composed of particles of dust, the size of which from ten to 100 times less than the usual home dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows the ring of black holes, remote at 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called ARP 273 photographed for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. "
Scientists call a large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this star nebula is the most spectacular group of new stars of our Milky Way.
Star cradle constantly creates new stars.
The starry cloud, united with the nebula socket, also constantly creates new stars, at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only the gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe had mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably the telescope was invented in 1608 Hans липперсгеем - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began monitoring the stars.
Since then, the Mirror optical telescopes became more and more available - and their view of space deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope, "part" of the Observatory паломар near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, is "big бинокулярный telescope."
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"the Grand Prix телескопио канариас" has a gigantic inner workings - diameter mirror alone accounts for 10.4 meters.
"the big South African telescope Mirror" in South Africa сегментировано - for the sake of reducing the cost.
Nevertheless in diameter, it reaches about 11 meters.
The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: telescope rigidly 37th under vertical angle is limiting his mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-эберли" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His feature: high светособирающая ability.
She reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirrors - the parameters of the world's major telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico) researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
Радиотелескоп has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the project, "the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), anyone with a computer can help by providing its processing power.
View of the European Astronomical Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is a "very large telescope" is entirely appropriate to its name.
His four mirrors allow cover in the visual tunnel even average infrared spectrum.
In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to install the European "very large telescope."
Its main mirror should раскинуться by as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos are not to be expected before the year 2018.
Until 2007, both "Keck telescope in Hawaii volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They installed two mirror with a diameter of about ten meters.
Telescopes, "Keck Observatory in Mauna Kea, which along with them, too, looking to the sky with telescopes" Subaru "and irttf.
In addition, on Mauna Kea should receive a new giant telescope - with a mirror with a diameter of three meters.
Here you can admire them the illustrations.
However, the most important species from space supplies of the Hubble Space Telescope. "
On April 24, 1990, he delivers the picture of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, "Kepler space telescope" looking for planets outside the solar system - the first such where life is possible.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that i.e. 1,235 candidate planets have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The photos show the last cooking "Kepler space telescope."
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space not before the year 2018 aboard rocket Ariane 5. "
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he must in light of the first stars and galaxies look for the big bang.
The scientists suggest that at the South Pole of Mercury is ice.
However, there is no reliable data about this, so as a "messenger" moves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over the decades pointed out that at Mercury is ice.
Thanks to the running in 2004 зонду "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now believe in it.

Drink butter every day - and live up to 168 years
Many residents in the Southern Azerbaijan reach a biblically getting older.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old men are still relatively young.
Many residents in the Southern Azerbaijan reach a biblically getting older.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old men are still relatively young.
The trip through the Talish Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
Minibus with tearing rumbling rolls along a winding road past the overgrown with dense forests hills, gushing rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright, that you might think that are in the Black Forest.
But it is the most southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they are fluent in Farsi and азербайжданском differ and longevity.
The final point is лерик.
A small town flaunts too ponderous Soviet-era architecture that is not attuned to the picturesque mountain landscape.
The tourists from Europe almost didn't come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too утомительна.
The 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
Legendary wealth, which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not gotten.
However, Pilate фатулаева (48) is convinced that лерике have something of interest for tourists.
"in May, Baku became famous festival song contest - and next year we will host a festival of the oldest people in the world," says фатулаева.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only in the world.
Here the documented biography about eight dozen Talysh of these places, which more than 100 years. Фатулаева points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
At the age of 136 years he was born another child
But the controversial star of the museum is a sheep herder ширали мюслюмов, who allegedly was 168 years.
Certificates of birth, however, is not.
But the fact that the oldest person whose age is documented, the age of 122 years, age мюслюмова seems extremely doubtful.
"he was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains фатулаева.
A man has been married three times, and he was 23 of the child, aged 136 years he allegedly was born daughter.
So whether sheep herder мюслюмов added a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher of the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia.
"surprisingly, many elderly people can be found in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia also lives very many very old people."
However, due to a lack of scientific proof of age is impossible, because it did not have the civil status registers.
Every day, a glass of baked oil
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area of лерика strikingly often reach biblical age.
Now here has 20 people aged over 100 years old.
Why here in the South, so many livers? "
Azerbaijani guide Farid мугимзаде explains this specific genes Talysh.
The director of the Museum of фатулаева, by contrast, believes that the diet.
Talysh like meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drinking on стакану baked oil every day, but it is unlikely that such a higher calorie content diet can be healthy with диетологической point of view.
Or the case in primitive lifestyle that keeps people youth? in ченгемиране, a tiny village near the town of лерик, lives рубаба Mirzoev.
In the 97 years she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Мирзаева, which claims that she 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with бочкой oils, which tirelessly катает back and forth.
Here are living under the same roof eight people, including one of the sons and daughter мирзаевой, who has already have their grandchildren.
Also nearby are jumping the two children.
Guests in the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in a typical pot-bellied армуду cold glasses.
The мирзаевой perfectly aligned and sturdy white teeth, under the head kerchief, she hides long dark-blond braids that her son proudly opens before us.
I always my hair milk, so that they never pull out and saved the color.
"and I never used shampoo," says мирзаева.
The monthly pensions enough for life
She always ate only what has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I have never bought the products in the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the Army.
It was most difficult after the second world war.
But it has become better when "beloved father, Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in speech of the old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins of his son, Ilham.
Nevertheless, among the Azerbaijani elders there is poverty.
230 manats (roughly equal to the same amount of euros) мирзаева receives a monthly pension for local conditions is the amount on which you can live well.
And, perhaps, long-raised son мирзаевой also is right: "old people in our culture are deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
What is not the reason to stay alive as long as possible

The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo show the deep rift in the country.
The future constitution based on sharia, met fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president also had pathos.
We must create a transition.
"and its success lies on my responsibility before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was converted to all people, but especially to the Christian коптам, liberals, enlightened Muslims and irreligious Egyptians.
After all, they are all still hopelessly fragmented into nonplussed opposition, fear.
The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood. "
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he was temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate in American University of Southern California, not entirely clear Egyptians and the rest of the world.
Will there be deprived of the power of the judiciary?
In fact, 234 articles have managed to smuggle into the night 15-hour jump configured with obstacles on the Islamic Constitutional Convention of 100 participants, and it is partly raises concerns.
As in previous constitutions, the draft says that the trial is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does it mean "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists will use blurred formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least it suggests one нововведенная article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, should be encouraged to the Council of the University of al-ашар, crucial Islamist institution of the country with great authority in Sunni Islam.
It should not, but may mean that the clergy enforces laws that de-facto would result from the limitation of the judiciary.
In the draft constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: should preserve jurisdiction of civilians the military court.
These courts during Mubarak's government served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family," and "maintain its morals and values."
It is legally formulated so vague that public institutions with the help of this article can control even the content of the film and literature.
Open text, it means nothing but censorship.
In general, no article does not set right the equality of men and women.
But the other prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording that prohibited "insulting people."
Is it enough to be caricatures of the president or jokes about правоведа?
The question of interpretation, like much of this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and who, in his words, "very soon" Egyptians will be submitted to a referendum.
"the revolution is back."
For several weeks, is formed by the opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can come into force.
"the revolution is back, and we'll win," said хамдин саббахи who came in third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed el-Baradei said the draft constitution place "on the scrapheap of history."
A short news service Twitter he accused supporters of Morsi desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"if he declares referendum, we will go to his palace and скинем him," said opposition figure Yasser said.
"we are still not tired, the blood of our brothers have not отмщена," he quoted the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many of the judges also said they do not want to observe the referendum, which would have made him invalid.
"the Koran is our constitution."
"the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for opposing demonstrations, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after the mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters who shouted: "the people of God requires the application of the law."
They demanded from Morsi: "очисти country!" and assured: "the Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the largely symbolic square, where it all started, almost triggered the state of civil war.
Followers of Morsi, quite obviously did not want to go to this risk.
"the Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution voted loud and clear.
Now it's time to let the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Most of the project for the Islamists, it is considered a done deal.
"the notion of" human rights "is not mentioned anywhere."
Hafiz Abu Sayeda in fury from this accelerated constitutional process, which actually was supposed to last until February, with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (еопр) defended the Muslim Brotherhood "when under Mubarak they sat in jail or tangential before the court.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights for him, indivisible.
For this he was beaten, jailed, arrested.
And now, the words "human rights" never meet in the new constitution, regrets it in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
The expansion of the influence of Morsi on all three branches of power in the state's disappointing lawyer.
These measures represent a clear attacks on democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"instead of trying to strengthen the civilian government, president of the de-facto annulled his" regrets Sayeda.
After all, without the civil organizations democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that everyone left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
Payment for this may occur.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "you are creating a monster, which will not be able to control."

The Norwegian ракфиск: the most badly smelling of fish in the world?
With a total population of Norway, one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe but also around the world.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely зловонному fish dish?
Take a few перезревших pieces of cheese.
Place them in a pile of dirty and steaming sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You could smell the smell отшибающий ракфиска - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around capped scenic views. "it is very beautiful, but in the air разлит неистребимый tangy smell.
Ракфиск is a trout, посыпанная salt and бродившая in water up to a year, depending on how it is nice to be achieved.
As the gathering twilight and холодает, crowds gathered on the Norwegians фагернесе festival dedicated to this, let's say, exciting dish.
"her eating raw and chewing glass of Aquavit, local тминной vodka," explains хавард хальварсен, a local fire by profession and concurrently "ракфисковый general, who runs the festival.
All around us people eat presliced small cubes fish and chewing her massive amounts of alcohol.
"someone like Akwawit than ракфиск," says хавард.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If we manage to smuggle piece under the noses, things are not so bad - not unlike portions of land that you took a long time with him on the bus.
The Norwegian ракфиск is the product of an entirely different times, times of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn замачивали insulation closed barrels with salt water.
Then, deep in the winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly забродила, its извлекали and приглушив perception of alcohol consumed in food.
Still on the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now, the population has been growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, which involve here jobs, higher wages and developed a system of social security.
Residents of Sweden (longtime rival, and still not so long ago and far more wealthy neighbor) massively come here to work.
Ракфиск perceived as an important symbol, indispensable, though several smouldering element of the past Norway.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you at 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the News of the world, and most of the residents of the country it seems satisfied.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist and racist last year расстрелявшего, killing 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, called the attack "happened on July 22."
Норвежцам is very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and killings.
At the heart of today's well-being is Norway (growth since the early 1970s), one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world.
"however, the oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress getting trays with elegant ракфиском, a woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, blond embodiment of well-being.
We are a nation - how do you call it is reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We don't like to exhibit at the show, we're not хвастливы.
Norway is very carefully drawn from its oil is a big part of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when all сорили money, which they had, Norway thrifty подсчитывала all costs.
"as long as you can go skiing in the winter and go to the movies in the summer, it is enough for happiness," says Anna.
"and there are ракфиск," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for some food - ракфиска with me enough.
Here's a hamburger with лосиным meat is certainly exotic, tasty сочное meat.
But in the evening, we will have more of the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel hold a special dinner dedicated ракфиск during which visitors will determine the best or, perhaps the most aromatherapy fish.
There is a direct телеэфир, which show leading into the bow tie surrounded plates with ракфиском.
It is like the Eurovision song contest. "
"so the Tor-Jurgen, what is the assessment you set for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"yes, хавард, here is our score...."
Everyone was laughing and cheering.
Someone falls from his chair, perhaps перебрав Aquavit.
Maybe, just надышавшись smell of this fish.

The Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto faces difficult start career.
While Mexico's president elect Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join the office, a correspondent of the BBC will grant invites us to look at the challenges he will face, and at the mixed expectations of the people of his country.
Traffic in Mexico City now, especially in poor condition.
This city is overloaded transport and in the best time, and Monday were erected steel barricades, перерезавшие several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to not let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent protesters from getting to the building of the parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto sets presidential перевязь and will take the reins of the country.
Before him is no easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which now keeps its powers, but the country is embroiled in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed some 60,000 lives.
"my government says the people of Mexico its willingness to deal with violence," said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Such statements until next to the president's political career of Mr. Peña Nieto developed's tenure as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, a vast and populous state surrounding the capital of the country, divided opinions about the new leader.
A staunch man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered.
Residents put him in the merit revival of tourism, the development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
Before the city can be reached on one of the new highway, built by Mr. Peña Nieto, who are very different from the roads from the pits, which were previously on this place.
Plates with his name are hanging on a modern building sports center and the impressive interactive museum, dedicated to climate change.
"we associate with him hope for real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally of Gabrielle ольвера Hernandez, a congressman from the state led by Peña Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed by our country, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of uninterrupted PRI party in power has been overtaken by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman ольвера admits that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes accusations of meaningless, who put forward the new president of the opposition.
He's very прямолинеен and very betrayed the cause of incarnations of his vision of the future of the country.
It is a great statesman, and, above all, the man who can listen.
But in another part of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality несауалькойотль, also known by the name of Ciudad ment, is the most startling contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under эстакадами highways, he is in many ways is a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are too severe nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, for the pacification of gangs that sell drugs in these areas were involved troops; and violence against women is a particularly acute.
On the vacant near the vast landfill only in the last two years, dozens of bodies were found murdered women.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico City during the regional Mr. Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar measure sad прославившемся violence in Ciudad Juarez, the name of which sea when it comes to murder innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, about him in the best case, it can be said that during his tenure as governor, he was not able to cope with the problem of the murders of women.
In the worst case, his administration accused of complete disregard for this problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this обветшалом district, Irineos буэндия with barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter марианы moon.
According to the official version of the Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she killed her inmate.
"when I went to her home, it seems that her body was washed before this," recalled Ms. буэндия.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body already окоченело.
The mother марианы retells the story, and a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifixion on which is written one word: Justice.
In this, they said, was denied this family.
"the state officials appealed to me as with the old сплетницей, discontented нарушительницей calm.
They want the people just took on faith what they say and помалкивали.
But it is wrong, so you can't, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings, "she says.
Wearing the presidential перевязь on Saturday, the president of Peña Nieto with her take the major responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico, chastened by the crimes associated with violence, and the new president promised to make the solution to this problem a priority during his presidency.
"I hope that it will be exactly the same as president, what was the governor," says ольвера, Congressman from the Valle de Bravo from the PRI.
However, this is what is most fear the families of the victims in Ciudad ment.

Bradley Manning have not complained of mistreatment, the indictment says.
The prosecutors are trying to rebut the claims Bradley Manning about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing increased attention was paid to Manning's stay at the military prison in квантико, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning's detention were brutal.
The U.S. Army private accused of kidnapping several thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution sought to prove that private Bradley Manning, accused in the biggest leak classified materials in the history of the United States, did not use lots of opportunities to lodge a complaint about his treatment, which, according to him, he had to move, while in military custody.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing at Fort mea, Maryland, a military prosecutor Maj. Ashenden Fein said that Manning's record weekly visits to the prison administration representatives for the first nine months of its content in квантико, Virginia, does not contain the complaints of mistreatment.
Cross-examination under consideration by the defence motion to stop Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning said the custody, he intended to commit suicide.
Military expert on the analysis of intelligence, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping several thousands of secret documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the website WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks site has not confirmed that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, the prosecutor Fein together with мэннингом checked reports that Manning completed visits after administration officials during his stay in prison квантико, where he was on a strict regime of imprisonment from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison officers мэннингу asked questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor Fein asked on Friday about reports that Manning acknowledged that assesses the appeal to himself on the part of the administration of the prison as "excellent" and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
Reviewed reports do not contain the complaints of mistreatment, despite the fact that Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, Fein said.
Manning said that he had spoken expressed concern about these issues and that he visited his administration officials discussed with him these problems and stated that they will, but not recorded it in writing.
"they recorded" no problems "(after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the subject in conversation," says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, Manning was asked why he never complained of abuse to him in January 2011, during a meeting of the commission, рассматривавшей suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for a few months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve that with him removed the regime "prevention" and softened the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited detention regime - at a level lower than the regime of supervision to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the security of others.
"I wanted to give the administration know that with me all right, so they canceled the regime to prevent injury... to the level of my life improved, from my point of view," said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and sent to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at the naval base in квантико, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he thought about suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness from the intense heat.
He explained that the psychologically very difficult when you do not know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"my world shrank back to base camp арифжан, up to the size of my prison," said Manning on Thursday.
"I thought I die in that cage."
By being квантико, Manning, according to him, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hour, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude.
Manning said that he was allowed to leave only mattresses, blankets, slippers, a few items of clothing and sunglasses.
He says he was trying to move as sleep, or even just lie in the daytime forbade rules.
According to Manning, during sleep in the eye, he consistently beat the light coming from the outside camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he переворачивался in bed at night, he said, being waked and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning's lawyer formally filed an objection about unlawful treatment of мэннингом in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning's statement that he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at квантико, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning inspection.
Manning said he had not had the opportunity to defend myself blanket during the investigation.
Answering questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of the guard that must throw blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked for his attempts to show the officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use the gum cowards or slippers to hurt themselves, but have not done so.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and points taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge at least take what he had to endure during detention, and substantially reduce the sentence, if Manning is convicted by military court, which is to begin a review of his case at the beginning of next year.
The defense said it plans to offer мэннингу accept the blame for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were acquitted.
The Pentagon argues that Manning held in квантико in accordance with rules governing the content of those arrested with the most stringent regime.
Among the accusations, nominated мэннингу, itemized aiding the enemy, illegal promotion of publication of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to the national defense, and the kidnapping of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all points of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.

My crisis of national self-determination - the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of the country about the difficult times.
Ruben наваретте believes that the American-born Mexicans caught between the two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City I went down the hall to arrive, approached the border control zone, and remained in place.
Signs pointed to the two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for the piece (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life called Mexican.
It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York consider themselves the Italians.
Later, I focused on the complex structure, "Mexican American."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
"I was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than the speakers, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I took his U.S. passport and was in line for the piece.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were usual for meetings between the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead of having to move to the United States.
He wants to conclude an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the president of Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but there was no concrete proposals.
For Mexico, relations with the United States - heavy and recorded old grudges question.
Most Americans have never thought that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico rifles at gunpoint and forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But the Mexicans think centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.
So it is worth only any U.S. statesman обмолвиться even a word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of the Mexican society immediately heard complaints that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma преисполняются militancy.
The most complex are Mexico's relationship with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about insults?
Their enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find themselves in this country for the opportunities, and those for whom there is no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - have not had the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of those were Mexicans of a certain type - complexion, education, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about it.
In Mexico, it see differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and got into the good work, but we should not forget that even this dream is an American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination запутано and unclear, but we know what the country considered his.
The United States of America.
Moreover, we know that the majority of the members of the Mexican elite and the ruling class, we do not like.
We answer them the same. "
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people, as the Mexicans inauthentic.
We are not well speak Spanish, and our relations with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them because of failure.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not now for silk curtain, finding in the US smug life, but having lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States, even as a child, and it reminds me of that between these Mexicans and Mexican Americans there are certain tensions - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexican origin is a shame.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends, the Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them.
We listen Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
And in the United States have called the Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during his trip, as if our relationship without enough intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell their friends-Americans about what is a beautiful country and how cool her visit, and would be able to convince the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing will.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, widespread corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not believe this country so great.
Sorry, but разбирайтесь with this themselves, check.
And this is true.
If a fraction of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States how they interact with Mexico half a century ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still in deep offense for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes it.
Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.

The old battle on the new Middle East
Agreement on a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas group may become a fragile foundation for further peace
Prospects for a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sound that became familiar, pointless debate about who first began; many buildings reduced to rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, fired from Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in its извечном conflict in the Middle East came changes.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" закружили in rebellious storm many established realities, with the Israelis and the Palestinians have not managed to stay away from the vortex, shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
The war without winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement, which was signed on November 21, will be performed that occurred this week, clashes only strengthened the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, protesting against what they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses incurred by them.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is ramping up its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends.
Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.
The victorious Hamas supporters say about creating around Israel Islamic crescent, from Lebanon in the north, which governs the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels overthrew the rule of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the King Power threatened by allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern border of Israel, in the most populous and influential Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the movement of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention to the support of Hamas.
Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are the organization is largely similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populism.
In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice could not drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "hard-line" in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the abandoned Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep easy, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to their unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence in the Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from Gaza, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly due to the wall, which comes on the territory of the West Bank, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections set for January 22 - merged with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very efficient.
What sense condone the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If you give into their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from the rockets toward Israel, as their brethren in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and pass on any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the "hard-line" victorious; however, their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.
The Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries that are not very warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.
Israel's defense of the budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, the combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism, president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the ceasefire, is a good sign and may mark the beginning of change.
Israel, not less, must take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.
As the onset of democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the occupied territories, like the bus, взорванному in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operations, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the movement Hamas, have to pay the growing discontent with the international community.
Both sides need in the external pulse
It remains the only solution to which relentlessly call sensible representatives on both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the education of two states and territorial concessions by Israel in exchange for security.
The hope is that not too impressive in the short term, "the hope that the cease-fire would allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which has long time to make the decision to block the arms into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have as ever in the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted in 1967, with land swaps and sharing of Jerusalem.
The other Arab countries should also make efforts toward reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming ballot at the UN, the result of which may become a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood.
Their role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, must play and President Obama.
During his first term, he never presented a plan for a peace settlement.
After returning to the White House, he still shows the reluctance to connect to the solution of this problem.
It is disastrously недальновидная position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australia came into force, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes.
The warnings about the hazards of smoking and disease affected by images of body parts contrast stand on a damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law on the same pack of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color design different brands of the same box of the gloomy and olive color with the terrible images of affected parts of the body, and images of children smoking health which undermined by their parents.
Besides the various images and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the stacks, imposed the mandatory with this Saturday - the name brands, which printed the same fine print.
It is the world's most stringent conditions for registration of the packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia says that the purpose of this action is to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit fashion status.
On the basis of this decision was based on the results of the research showed that people who do not smoke began to 26 years, 99 times out of 100 never become smokers.
"it is obvious that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," explains health minister Tanya плиберсек, citing a study by that, for example, the crown logo in children is associated with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes do not affect the profits of multinational corporations, however, are already considering the possibility of taking such measures and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market, which would be sold cheap and accessible cigarettes.
"this law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought it was initiated," said Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that demand for cigarette and silicone cases, hides unpleasant images on the package, rapidly grew up (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case to the High Court of Australia, where he tried to appeal against the law.
According to Sandra ha, Zico has already implemented around six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects the new party.
For us, it is a good business.
The potential impact on the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among precisely that part of the population, which sent these measures.
In Australia after the passage of several laws that makes illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibit cigarette sellers display in a prominent place, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it cannot limit this foreign sites.
"if you sell tobacco and you are left with only this small light, the idea is to promote their products on the Internet looks like a very attractive," explains Beca Freeman, examined the issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on brand names written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users on social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether it is the work of the average citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare no effort and time and made the video, or behind this advertising campaign?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco argues that the industry is more busy adapting to new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that the trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries are very slight.
Decision of the WTO is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya плиберсек, the government has discussed with the other countries to adopt similar laws on their packaging.
In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory posting photos, warning about the hazards of smoking.
Now it is usually taken in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovations.
These pictures of me without touching.
I just don't pay attention.
"just выхватываешь cigarette and прячешь pack in his pocket," explains Viktor Al Haig who buys cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor at the mouth of either.
Frankly, the only thing that can make me give up - this is my little daughter.
James Yiu, head of the tobacco shop King of the pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging compounded the problem of goods on the shelves
"before I left the unloading of the new party, an hour, and now four hours," he complains.
"the government should have to take and not ban cigarettes, we would then said: what to do, OK, it's over, shut up shop," he says, вскидывая hands up.

Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it's not so bad.
This Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport because of our aircraft revealed the mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we and waited.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - it's really boring, and there is not much help either books, magazines, nor the iPhone, nor even the duty-free shops.
But in recent years, more and more scientists and experts on child development support in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children bored is not so bad.
It forces the brain distracted on interesting related topics that might encourage creativity.
And because in the modern world, we are constantly before some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us.
Maybe we need to strive to boredom?
Yes. "
And at the same time, not.
We will come back to it.
I, like many, believed that boredom is a relatively recent invention of the times, when people got more free time.
This is not so, says Peter ait, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book "fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"actually boredom boasts a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions of boredom, dating from the first century.
It remains an open question about how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.
Numerous studies on this topic and asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but they can't deal with the fact that they would bring a satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that скучающий man is not doing something that I wanted to do.
Nothing to do with apathy do not want to.
The main in переживаемой boredom, he says, is a "violation of the attention and related deterioration in mood and feeling that time goes slowly."
The description of the boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible connection between these conditions скучающие people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, when in fact we just find it difficult to concentrate on something.
In his study, "the unoccupied mind: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the previously conducted an experiment, participants listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises are not relevant to the case of TV programs included in the next room, others heard these same sounds at a low volume, so that they could barely read, and a third group was listening only to record the voices without sound track.
Those participants who heard a low-volume, noted that they were bored, more than others, they found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus attention on the difficult or fascinating task, interruption of attention may cause weariness, says Mark J. фенске, associate professor of neurology at the University of гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something неинтересное, "for example, всматриваясь in the flow of goods on the line in search of marriage, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom."
It is considered, he said that when people start покачиваться on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that actually such actions not just help relax physically.
"the study showed that children who do not prohibit fidget and swing, learn better and remember more information than children from which require sit tight," said Professor фенске.
In some moments, we experience boredom: when a flight delay (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, watching the film uninteresting.
However, different people have different levels of the propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure such individual researchers have developed a special "scale of the propensity to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, "much of what I have to do, monotonous and chant" or "me too much fun, so I don't have time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that bored boys more than girls, "says Stephen воданович, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially if there is a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers are often bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted via pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said they are bored at school and at the time of the execution of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents said that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no information about what would such data about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "in adolescence have the propensity to boredom," mainly because children and adolescents are not allowed to fully resolve than they do.
Go back to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes no, because she was in extreme cases, studies show, can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or betrayal of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor воданович dedicated to the study of the problem more than two decades.
"so our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is the boredom," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this is the brain does not always knows what to do better.
If you'll be bored and you will receive this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
However, if you watch TV, you will be better only for some time, and soon it will pass.
So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he will miss, but he did not learn to deal with boredom alone or in any other way to manage their time and employment, "said Professor фенске.
"these skills and self-regulation used in various situations," he said.
Your child learns not only to occupy themselves something, he also learns control at all.
I don't think the boredom need to somehow praise.
However, it considered something bad is not worth it.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with this.
"we see it so that we need more experience boredom, with boredom is an extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people tend to disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax.
"in the modern world, we are accustomed to constant over-stimulating the senses," he says, "and when the silence, we don't know what to do."

It is unclear how the new law will apply the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, Nineteen-player football team and the student community college in the south-east of Colorado charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be quite legitimately throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in ламаре and rode in a car across the prairie near the border with канзасом when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came agenda to the court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug use is a minor offences for each of them had a fine of $100 dollars - and set the date for the trial.
"with US treated as criminals," says Mr. Orozco.
But whether he criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small cases depends not so much from the law, how much of the place of consideration.
Accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, have already been charged in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which has adopted a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charges people at the age of 21 years and older for possessing small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law will come into force.
However, in the more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases related to marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of marijuana.
At the same time in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountain regions of the West vote to avoid the appearance of their places of new state shops licensed to sell marijuana.
"all this is growing so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," says Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also озадачено почесывают heads.
They will form a licensing rules to determine the order of cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all that needs to be done before 1 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of issues of the use of marijuana for medical purposes at first, and now for entertainment.
"in Colorado more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and. Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in the state of Washington.
But now, no one can do more to recognize Mr. Smith than to put forward any proposals and hope that it would work.
"we have no real precedent on which we could navigate," he says.
The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, will enter into force on December 6, and on the whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when there are no state licensing system, and the right to possession of marijuana has been institutionalized.
And because there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between state regulation of "adequate access" to the licensed marijuana with its ban on trade within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"it is especially difficult to place the licensed enterprises for trade in marijuana in the inner cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly-established research group called the Center for the legalization of marijuana. "
November 21, police chief Oates from Aurora to subordinates sent an e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office no longer attract the persons who have reached the age of 21 years, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops уличать people in these violations "from this moment."
Police chief Oates said that the police would monitor the observance of the rules governing the activities of individuals planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will pursue drug traffickers and distributors.
The prosecutor Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that prosecutors would still be liable for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage use of its people to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"the duty of our institutions - pursue for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr tank in a statement.
The response was controversial even in places like rural Mesa County, where the voting members rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of small amounts of the drug.
District Attorney Pete хаутцингер supported that decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges already open cases involving custody of marijuana.
"I believe that enforce the law until he won't change is our duty," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of residents of the state of Colorado, took part in the voting, supported the decision, the inclusion of issues of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
A controversial reaction of people in different parts of the state revealed the ambiguity attitude of local authorities to experiment with marijuana in the state.
"the district prosecutors on this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean макалистер to have a lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"they're so long persecuted people for it that now can't really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states in which a small number of marijuana are the same as to alcohol is destined to become the experimental field throughout the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Advocates of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time, they are cautious awaiting instructions from the federal authorities who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Advocates of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Justice Department would cede on this issue.
Despite a number of high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients reported using marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases made good on trade in marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
The agents of the Bureau of anti-narcotics are unlikely to be interrupted at home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become blind eye on regulated by the authorities of the state recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on anti-drug in the Obama administration.
Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores selling marijuana, and so could not open up sooner than a year.
Last week, the монтроуз, a city in the western part of the state, put forward by the six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"we don't want to be in this position that we will issue the license to someone, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now there is a contradiction between the results of the local voting and voted for that state.
There is still a lot of unresolved issues.

Петронелла уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for what I'm conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views not started today.
As long as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described him as the best in the world, the institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, закладывающий two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of training on вустерского college history at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not survive and burst into tears.
The friends were are bewildered.
Newspaper the Evening Standard claimed that I threw college because I didn't like that my classmates have sex in the next room.
The writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from a Shcherbatykh cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran because I was systematically hounded and intimidated.
It is not because of my rather unusual name or what I attended a private school.
I was hounded for only one reason, and in this renowned cradle просвещенности it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow уайэтт, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a follower of conservatives.
You ask, why should remember about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, reinforces center-right views, is subject to the same kind of harassment.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of students-conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as one that is provided by the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say their "often actively isolate put personal attacks and are forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter into a committee on equal rights of the college alternate representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their only exacerbated the situation released recently on BBC Two documentary about politics in the students' environment, "the land of miracles: young, smart and right-wing," in which the Conservatives presented eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film was shown Joe Cook, the former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who drives a Rolls-Royces, wears a silver suit and stick with silver набалдашником.
Students at other universities-conservatives complain that they are doing "scapegoats for higher fees for their studies."
Luke black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of conservatives from Nottingham University, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that the university increases skew toward the left.
The people who we don't even know beforehand believe us bold and unpunished unruly children of wealthy parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the history department at Corpus Christi College, which was filed the petition on strengthening the protection, calls such an atmosphere "неуютной" and Stephanie черилл, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of the members of the student club number center-right views dramatically worsened.
"it is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate or simply to normal life of members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I came back in September 1986, timid and shy восемнадцатилетней girl.
Oxford лихорадило from hatred of the Conservative party.
The year before, the university voting deprived the former student Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even Revolutionnaire.
In the first days of the week freshmen, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt what awaited me ahead.
I didn't know that teachers not only looked through the fingers at a hunt-conservative students, but also gladly took part in it.
The political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and opposition of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - seeped through the walls trimmed wood panelling audiences.
On my first workshop I needed to translate the text of the eighteenth century French into English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.
"miss уайэтт," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was me with difficulty, I hesitated.
Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face like a cake.
"тэтчеристы fundamentally not taught French or they simply don't have enough brains?" he asked.
The other students захихикали.
In my eyes were full of tears.
"I advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his spare time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," - пробрюзжал Pitt.
I returned to my room is absolutely miserable.
That evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student at the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Association of University.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
"unfortunately, the is as follows:
Over every who is suspected of sympathizing with the Conservatives, will scoff.
I was very easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the freshmen and conservatives pretend that they Labour. "
Later, at the local pub, I timidly tried the scenes.
I insisted that it does not agree with everything he says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick failed.
Freshman at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "you're the daughter of the fascist pig.
You are contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was worn, dirty.
"as the Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"they're колотят each other, right?"
I felt like must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the Sixties.
Can I ever to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded only under cover of night?
Will I be forced labor and conceal their true beliefs?
Coming to me three years began to seem hell, full of temptation and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, has not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriters.
In college, he did not appear.
He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist-детерминистскому view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of билкент in Ankara, Turkey.
"here you will not be happy," he told me.
I started to go to Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and impartial Metropolitan friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s there were any political views.
"but it's the best university in the world," he said plaintively.
"there is not capable, not only in the city of dreaming spires....
Even my friends-Communists always behaved impeccably. "
His wet eyes помутнели.
"do not pick up any hasty decisions.
I am sure that it's just a joke.
You're разобьешь my heart, if the university matter. "
I was crafting regular visits to London and my emotional defense ultimately collapsed.
My friend, also a conservative, unable to bear the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
Next week during the seminar, when the next history teacher quite seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
The burning with shame, I admitted that "I was brainwashed brains parents," and called them "old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford, was destined to score my father.
At the same time, he every week wrote two columns for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not appear, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me плаксой and cloth.
But the eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.
Even sadder that it was the Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers Tories, but to this day is hiding behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence.

"Valentino prefers elegance of glory."
The exhibition "Valentino: master of sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Nachi абаскаль, фионой Thyssen-борнемица and other famous female Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of the British Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, worthy to take an exhibition about Valentino гаравани.
The designer acknowledged it during the opening of "Valentino: master of sewing," the triumphal retrospective exhibition, which brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created his "home" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character which is "Il Signor" гаравани, but she could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated with rare and distant world nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition is open until March 3, include personal letters and photographs signed by most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess салимы Aga Khan to Lord сноудона, including Marie-Chantal, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social upheaval: from humble tailor вогера from the city in northern Italy before the idol of international "elite."
To be enamored with the Royal Court - there is nothing wrong.
"they even kill cigarette butts of their cigarettes on your beautiful carpet, as some of the great stars of pop music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-борнемица.
In the 1960s and 1970s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino - бесподобный boss and takes guests with generosity and elegance.
"we all loved to come to his chalet in гштааде," explains the former wife "Hayni" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like мареллы Agnelli or Eugenia F.Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of glory.
And despite this, he is a star.
Valery мацца, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria мацца recalls charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner to his home, it was after a fashion show on the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty were invited Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino style manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its design, the food, the music.
"each of the guests Valentino gave feel important and loved," recalls "Top Model" with fashion designer whose work began in 1995, during the high fashion week in Paris.
"he never goes out of fashion because his sketches - it all works of art," she concludes.
Pedigrees parade of
Life гаравани - history does not одержимостей and full of loves to reciprocate.
He loves people with a good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries Somerset House was turned into a glamorous podium sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must дефилировать on the podium, contemplating "spectators" of the dreams that sparkle masterpieces from Valentino, such as dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her marriage to Aristotle онассисом, costume, who used the Monica витти in "Night" or coat from wool and leather, which belonged to Empress Farah диба.
In this audience of models блестают such names as Sybil Luxembourg, Gloria von Tarnie und таксис, метте Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nachi абаскаль and fashion designer, in 2006.
Many of these clients say the first Valentino - as a first love, "it is impossible to forget."

The hardest job in the world: miners with кавах-иджена
In four euro Indonesian miners risking life and limb, втаскивая 70 kilograms of sulphur on top of the volcano on steep trails combined
There are people for whom their work - hell, while others literally work in hell.
Among them are the Zaporizhzha виджайя, one of the 400 miners who earn a living prey of sulfur into the volcano кавах-иджен, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day the Zaporizhzha comes down to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens on contact with air.
Отколов huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which may reach 70 kg, he puts them into two bamboo baskets, shoulders baskets on their shoulders and brings up the precipitous rocky road.
Up to the top of the volcano that is 39.411 meters, just 250 meters, but изможденным грузчикам takes more than 40 minutes to climb snail's pace, with difficulty holding the balance and carefully нащупывая road to not оступиться and not fall over the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened with one туристкой from France, which started a few years ago with rocks кавах-иджена.
Miners with кавах-иджена earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulphur, which mined
Once at the top, they pave his way between the tourists who photographed them as if they were the most notable of the circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, stride three kilometers to the scales that mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 metres.
It is about 95 Kandy нгримби, the company, which operates in 1960, the volcano and it is better not to say its employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) petrochemical industries, because this mineral circulated in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
"since the norm is переноска 70 kilograms, we earn about $46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each ходку," explains US antonyms, which usually carries three daily carry.
He spends three hours for each of them and in the end feels broken, but they allow him to amass 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems мизером for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more of what he would have earned in the field.
"поденная miners fee is very high at local standards, where coffee for collecting pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains Porter, who previously bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was just 75.00 rupees (6.2 euros) per day, and the plot was not as dire, but the Zaporizhzha баньюванги returned with her family in a small town near the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is the same crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to the Jawa, converted to Islam."
The Zaporizhzha asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he слезятся eyes because of toxic gases
In his 27 years the Zaporizhzha spent three years, risking a кавах-иджене, sulfur which has already started to affect him despite the availability of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he слезятся eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"it'll go for another two years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises a more than acceptable English.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, the waiter or the doorman at the hotel, but instead he performs work mule.
Dividing dirty wooden hut with other носильщиками, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to flow at night when her distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and shines in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, the Zaporizhzha descends into the crater, covering a small flashlight, подсоединенным to his Cascais, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters being dragged baskets with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company will not mechanized extraction sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment носильщикам who work at their own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not get even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) fee for taking photos, which, along with a ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with tourists who come to photograph the volcano and his men and mules.
"this work for cattle, and not for the people," says бадрусин, stocky носильщик 42 years, who spent on кавах-иджене three decades, ever since I left college.
Able to raise up to 110 pounds, he insists he will accept the job "as much as you can," because he needs the money for the education of his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
Do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur burn burned by the throat and eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about his severe illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and ulcers on his shoulders, which деформировались under the weight of Corzine.
Hovering basket on his back, унайник now only can raise the 50 kilogram in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which carry three trucks at a warehouse in тамансари, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the swamps.
"do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says унайник, widely opening her mouth, which lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also works as a carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from generation to generation is one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what do human mules with кавах-иджена.

Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans accused career, stress and prices for housing and education in the absence of children.
"the people of Singapore needs to grow."
My husband Patriot, you are my wife патриотка to fulfill our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising мятных loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of it - it's the video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying something like "let's put Bao (булку) in the oven" to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
The advertising agency that has made this video, BBH to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to this problem in the form of entertainment.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to people fulfilled "its national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world for the renewal of their kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government tried to do many things, such as the launch of spirits with pheromones or organize parties quick singles (blitz-visits).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative thing of the possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap?
The child 1.2
Who does not take it so lightly, so it is the government of Singapore.
It is spending $1,300 a year on politics for the enthusiasm of citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, prolonging pregnancy and maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and its strict social control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to its national governance on the population, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the National Office of population, says the reason is "improved education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"this allowed people to have a wider range of options in life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and creating a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms, help increase the number of Bachelorette and postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at the sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who were criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that last year, Singapore's ruling party has got the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While falling fertility has a certain influence on the economic growth of the nation's tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to not built so many small housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
Guidance on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments area of 46 square meters sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can contribute холостому lifestyle and deprive the incentive to developers who want to build a big family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the company showed El developers, says that their "boxes of shoes" sold much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow increases.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers who earlier put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Is too перенапряженные
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking with сингапурцами who work in the financial district of the city, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"people are very stretched, expensive housing and education, and because of this, many people this delay," says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"but for me, it's important to have their own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and prices for housing and education as factors that hinder them to have children.
So, how would the government nor even encourage their citizens to the birth of children in childbirth, the final word rests with сингапурцами.

The personal is offline - personal online
The privacy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, we are talking about private property or the "sphere of personal life, which have the right to defend against any invasion."
That is a personal for a minor under 16 years?
As he uses this definition in their daily lives and in the social networks?
Whether he understands the danger of being when discussing the Internet situations that would probably not shared outside of the Internet?
Elperiódico took an interview with five guys from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they were associated with the term "something very my" in a private plane, and "password and username" when used it to social networks.
"my biggest secrets I would not be uploaded to the post," says 10 Jorge when trying to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"it is a very sensitive secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he said.
The FB I load the beautiful pictures or pictures from the Games.
Also I play with their friends.
"I would not have shared a photograph that is not mine, or someone who behaves silly," he says.
The boy is aware that bad publishing obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write offensive or vitriolic comments.
Jorge insists he knows 35 friends who in his FB, and nine of its фолловеров on Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
The mother know, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express themselves and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know whether to meet me, I only their load," he adds.
"social networking is entertainment, I can talk with distant relatives or with friends-quick," he says.
Without thinking, says that would never accepted a request from an unfamiliar faces.
Wouldn't be with someone who recommended that a stranger.
The case of the 14-year-old Jose is.
The teenager there are open accounts at Hotmail, Facebook, my space and ask, and in the latest admits he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
"it doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one to him not втирался in confidence and not asked his home address or phone number.
"if the pressure will be on me or require simply remove them from their account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is known as кибермоббинг.
One familiar my girlfriend blackmailed into the social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"he never found out who it was," he said.
The victim, according to Jose, not deleted account.
"the only included confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos or конфузных acquaintances into uncomfortable situations.
Yes, I would have done it, if the person I don't like it or if I want to.
"although I know it кибермоббинг," he confirms.
The key questions
Марьелос поррас, who teaches English and expert on education and training, said that in order to guide the children and teenagers need to understand that the purpose of social networking - inform.
"the Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Поррас indicates that Professor Mark пренски, Master of Education from Yale University and the author of labor digital natives and immigrants who invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
They are digital natives, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
"we digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we are still learning about themselves," she says.
Explains that this issue is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria of what you can or can't distribute, publish or speak, at age when not mature enough for that."
"also that they were selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what the privacy of children and adolescents, "ask questions that make them think.
"tell them that they are not doing this, useless," she added.
Then поррас lists some options: there are things that you're not told a stranger, so why do you do on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked it if published a photo of you like the one that you published about his friend?
Do you know what others publish about you? "
When you sign photos with parties, ask whether you're letting other people to celebrate their?
And one more thing, all I need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another option is to let them understand that they must behave online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"outside of the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, so it should be on social networks," she said.
The vigilance of
Эстуардо гуардия, university lecturer, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need to the heads of families conscientiously read the policy of social networks.
Understanding the each of the items, they have good grounds for talks with children about the preconditions for opening an account on the Internet.
"for example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish," he says.
According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children a lesson "don't talk to strangers."

VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru, without public лимской declaration, announced earlier and theoretically binding signed by family members.
Efe has repeatedly attempted to gain access to the document signed by the sixth regular meeting of heads of state and government of Unasur, however, sources from the office of the president and the administration indicated on the main page that his accuser after closing, but then confirmed that at some point he will be published on the Web site of the Peruvian government.
The questions about the text, they pointed out that the contents had described Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press.
The journalists' access to information about the summit was all the time is limited.
During the day, it was only транслировано, in the hall for the press, the video of the president of the Assembly without sound with the message "closed session, the sound is prohibited."
Little information that cleanly among reporters, was handed over to the press secretaries of some governments Unasur, attending the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document common during the day, was a list of participating presidents, prompting hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, which asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of president of Peru sent an email to the media, "the final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's statement, not an official document, which ended on the summit.
Last October, Peru took III summit of South American and Arab countries (Aspa), and at the same time, despite the fact that this insistently demanded by the press, also has not been distributed so-called Lima declaration, which was previously announced.
On the official Web site of the Aspa can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings Peruvian authorities tried to were provided with the transmission system for all journalists, but most have limited information.
The summit also ended with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague court to settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered on a regional meeting and ratified that will abide by the decision of the international court, which starts on Monday at the Hague hearing statements from both sides, in the framework of the charges that Lima put forward against Santiago.
"we are going to enforce the decision clarifies the disagreements that we are currently present in the International Court of Justice," said Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals," Pinera said, shrugging his hands and greeted Humala against a background of flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents that they flout international court, happened shortly after the Colombia pact боготский signalled this week, according to which she confessed after submission of gaining this international court decisions on sea borders with Nicaragua, which she considered wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Rousseff дилмы; Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in the UNASUR was suspended from 2011 after the impeachment of former President Fernando Lugo, who did not participate in the meeting.
I am president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for the opening of discussions in the morning and the closing of the summit later лимскому noon at the time.
The head of state read the final document, which reported that were adopted 16 agreements and were approved by the direction of the actions to 31 project among South American countries, the amount of the alleged investments amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements he mentioned that the countries of the UNASUR take "important steps toward the goal of American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreement about the place of residence."
He said the actions taken to improve the "cooperation in the fight against the insecurity of the citizens and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, inexpensive Internet access in all corners of South America and taking into account the total and effective way of the risks of natural disasters."
Because Europe is in crisis, "Economic Association (Latin America) should not be triumphalist basis, and should serve to expand our manufacturing base and anticipate a better future for our cities," added Humala.
"we decided to give the privileges of a group of 31 landmark projects that improve communication areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming a new economic scheme," said Peruvian president in his message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and limited transverse axes on its territory, from coast to Brazil, and two aimed at greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"we hope that the electoral process in this country will serve her re-accession to the Union of South American nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need to Latin America was a region of prosperity and peace, would be United, and had the good relations between the neighbors, was another topic, подчеркиваемой at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for talks in good form on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court, the impugned Bogotá.
"the day after tomorrow (Saturday), will meet with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"we will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
"with the President Ortega, hopefully I can tell him that we cope with this as much as possible in a civilized and respectful manner," added Santos.

"South America must learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "were killing each other during the second world war," and in other clashes, "but now they are almost one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the draft of the establishment of American citizenship, which favor UNASUR countries.
"it is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want to return us to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president proved, moreover, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition for reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who lectures, never undertake any obligation, and we, the South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
"inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, hinting at the political asylum given Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he does not regret the decision, because with him it's not betraying their principles, and honors the "deepest values of democracy and human rights."
He added that there were "certain suspicion that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be respected the process."
He criticized the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged crimes of sexual violence, while "the Swedish law considers it possible to carry him through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he was a pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian head of state.
What is really there is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health of confined in a small space without the possibility of doing exercises on the air.
"it affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa said the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange since June the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that the negotiations were in London on finding a solution to the problem in the confines of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating about human rights, is a word in this case, we do not use, but there were constant debate.
"the solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, leads a number of processes in various European institutions," he said.
And argued that "if the United Kingdom tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and how it has done in other cases to be examined by Senor Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or be examined him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that "does not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression."
"the main enemies of freedom of the press is not corrupted villains-policy, and bad journalists supporting speculative, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained satisfied that none of these journalists, "neither bankers nor the bourgeois countries-гегемоны does not dominate in Ecuador," and added that being reelected, "deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain veto Paraguay in UNASUR at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and will not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of legality," because in reality, "it has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considers, moreover, "perfectly legitimate" desire to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos now lead the negotiations with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries after the decision by the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which turned out in favor of Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not observed.
It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
Need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good end to the dispute over maritime borders, who are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "the right thing for Latin America to turn to the international court if the two countries agree to accept the decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the ability to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, though sometimes it's pretty hard."
Correa assured that if it loses the election in February 2013, the disappearance from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed only by political power.
"my political movement decided what I guaranteed the probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
In case of victory, it would be my last term in office of the president, and then we move out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
"this decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Denmark, who told me that he had gone for treatment, which has already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will miss a campaign to return to Cuba.
"it does not mean the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.

Deaths from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I was like a stunned," he recalls that difficult, despite all the rhythm of the doctor's time.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease itself, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible, and his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients of the hospital hospital civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he appeared in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with a diagnosis "of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe when there are too few treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients.
Thus, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he was cut."
In other words, in those days have AIDS was the sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do it without reducing quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, until now, many people come, when the virus has already caused damage, "drained" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported, the "great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient, which begins to timely treatment, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the Department of HIV-HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing the fact that this information is confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the expected life expectancy for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when a reported 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that the one who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years old," he explained.
To assess this progress, we should remember that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years old.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in халиско 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May of this year; nevertheless, argues that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
"why so far there are deaths?
"personally, I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I think it, so the case in our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients are coming very late, because they do not know about his инфицированном condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited the devastating data: "nine out of ten patients come when we already have some оппортунистическую infection; what you need to do to exert more influence on the overall mortality rate is to conduct the diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who will be asked."
In its proposal agree experts and officials of the State Council on prevention of AIDS in халиско (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to check into a private laboratory, motivated by the fact that it made his friend and, despite his young age, he was already on the stage of AIDS and even suffered саркомой's sarcoma, a cancer that is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that will die, and don't want to know.
"time still die, the better I'll be надираться three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I nourish myself, doing the exercises, take drugs.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of lessons, I travel, I conduct an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility to take care of yourself and of another person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with Milenio Jalisco to be influenced by talking to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is afraid.
Let the checked if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
It is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in this 2012.
The counter condoms
Big gap between programs in health and simple citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who started a problem related to HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now we give packages hundreds, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still does not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"why are you?" is a popular issue with ехидством and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, employees pharmacies and health care workers who do not want to hear teenagers, assured the communicator.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms were not only hundreds of them, and that was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places that are often visited by young people.
It is not encourage promiscuity.
We are not talking about the payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when he was asked how there can be distributed condoms under his leadership.
"it's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
The key data халиско
Registered 13,435 (12,158 total cases of AIDS and HIV 1,317).
The state ranks fourth place in the national rankings on new and total cases of AIDS and the 13-th on HIV.
92% of the infections are related to sexual way, 6 percent through blood and 2% to перинатальному path.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, because on the one known case there are 4 to 5 people who don't know about it.

It is also true that subtracting the voices of branches, somehow Vitro creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds "vultures" like aurelios capital, aurelios way, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, does not have a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These data drops the appeal court.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with whom she has faced since 2008, concern raised serious economic crisis, who flee the United States, stabbing across the country.
So far, the family firm Gonzalez garden would appeal the decision by the court of appeal to the vote came to its plenary session of the five judges, in view of the fact that only three votes.
In the case of our failures will be charged the identity, which would require a review process on the part of the Court of Appeals, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of ewcs curiae ("friend of the court"), in which he described the process, which should be Vitro within the framework of the law on competition matters, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with agreements signed by both countries to associate it with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy.
In addition, noted that the country is bowing to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules set for interstate insolvency cases that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carom from two boards: they beat in vitro and hit the country.

Hector "хетин" Reyes: "basketball has been my life."
The avid basketball traveler Hector "хетин" Reyes was more than 60 years is associated with this sport and, thanks to him, has travelled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "хетин" Reyes.
And since before bleeding in the brain приковало him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and the head of the BSN suppose баямона and president of basketball federation.
"I have done a lot of roles in basketball, throughout his life, including several at once, as when I was president of BSN, director general of the national team and president of the Federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to his home in the Primera Hora баямон, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"basketball has been my life."
Reyes was not exaggerating, making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all with photographs and memorable things gathered for his long journey to testify about it.
The heart баямон
With the largest emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years of his performance in the role of co-agent or agent contract.
"it was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the Cowboys eight championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, a year of Jerome Minsky's debut in BSN.
Since then, and continue to lead became "куко" Ortiz, who was a great manager, "said Reyes.
I remember Jean бартов, who arrived here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you, there is a very strong player who stands 6 '7."
"do you want?"
And it was the beginning of the Minsky, one of the best players who were in Puerto Rico.
Бартов then recommended that the sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and has become one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if Minsky brought the championship баямону, гаусс would help win another.
The Cowboys чемпионством гауссом I'm puffing, but already at a distance, because in 1988, has been portrayed as the chief of the Federation.
By the time I chose to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Minsky in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got the fourth place and it had to be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, Reyes said.
The team to the 1990 World Cup is the best team, what you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite was the one with the plays in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and smashed the US national team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Championships.
The team not only once again played Minsky, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, FICO Lopez and 'пикулина' (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'тоньито' colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'кихоте' Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of knee injuries.
The team, which probably was not the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 неукене, Argentina.
With role players like 'канито' ньевеса, Pablo алисеа and young Rolando хурруитнера instead of players, temporarily estranged for turmoil in панамериканском championship in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was a пикулин Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has not dominated at this level, as did пикулин.
And that is without his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best пуэрториканцем head?
It is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond далмау, армандито Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work Leo ариллы.
What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in the season.
What do you need to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruits of compulsory certification and training for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoying his grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, иcабель, which has always been with me.

But it was his workshop interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. led хэгмэна on top of glory.

The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?" episode conceived to create hype around, full of emotion, in which a character хэгмэна nearly killed, spawned international discussion and millions of dollars, which risked fixtures.

The course, which explores the "end of the world."
Every week, the students study the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharma decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew he had the irresistible lure: the end of the "long" Mayan Calendar Countdown to December 21, for which many people seized as evidence that heralded the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea that he was welcomed in the next couple of months: catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "долгоармагеддоном," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, the place where the end times Christian theorists believe that will start the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said Sharma this week, the students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we have less than 30 days, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those who an apocalyptic mind.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically last in history.
The темпльском University associate professor Barry вакер reads the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, the students study the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"we analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way that offer the hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.
If the nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, the war could erupt.
This month, the students analyzed the movies on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell the students that may perhaps plausible and impossible," said вакер.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew ресталл and his counterpart Amara солари, associate professor of art history and anthropology, gathered to read the course, which is called simply "the end of the world."
"we're not add '2012' to always have the opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the world will not come," said ресталл.
Despite the "imminent destruction," students should learn to cook projects and take the final exams.
The Penn State final exam will be made on the eve of the apocalypse that does not leave students with no choice but to work "to the same night, which presumably will come the end of the world," said ресталл.
The courses were quite popular.
"the place out for two hours," said ресталл about its course for students with high average scores on which did 35 students.
We received an e-mail for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked whether another place.
The students, in turn, to assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to console themselves," said бриджид Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Department of religion and sociology from хаддонфилда, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
The image of an apocalyptic thoughts, secular or religious, it's just a matter of comfort or its absence.
Will векеса, 25-year-old student of the department of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of course that would teach it," he said.
He like me.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor, said he believes in the doomsday date of December 21.
"our first project touched the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we are his discredited," said Julie зеглен, 21-year-old student at the last course темпльском University of West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said ресталл.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people respond to changes around himself, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase of these speculations.
"in other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mainly in англоговорящем world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knew any well-informed about the "end of the world" there.
"the Philippines did not participate at the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the appeal.
We have a pardon from the pope.
Ресталл noticed that for a long time about many of the last days of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or the philosophizing that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
The students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said they are going to go to parties, "the end of the world."
"maybe the call someone from friends to laugh together," said Samir Ford, 20-year-old student majoring in communications.
