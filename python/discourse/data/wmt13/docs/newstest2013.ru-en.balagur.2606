The Republican strategy of resistance to the election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy necessity of combating spin in the election.
But in the centre of Brennan believe the last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in elections in the United States more rare than deaths from stroke of lightning.
Besides the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing we can say with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the US.
That is why most state governments from 2009 pass laws, insiders to register or vote.
This phenomenon has received new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result, only one 2011 was taken by 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, discontinue the right to register voters in the day and will take away the right to vote from citizens who have a prior conviction.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state does not oblige voters to present photo identification.
Indiana is the first state, which introduced such a requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld in 2008 the constitutionality of the law, enacted in Indiana.
Republican officials rushed to extend this practice and to other states.
In the last two years, they initiated bills that obligate voters to present photo ID, in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity cards, as health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, there are 21 million people, have reached the required for voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often more than one hundred dollars.
New restrictions are disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the required photo ID.
But it is not all.
Students - voters believed to vote for candidates from the Democrats in several states are not allowed to use the photo identification issued by their school.
But these same states allow members of the fishing and hunting clubs who vote largely for Republicans, to use for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004, no state has not demanded evidence of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures, obviously, are meant to limit voting immigrants from Latin America.
It is believed that two thirds of the Latin American voters to vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws, registration of voters on election day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction does not have passed without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign on voter registration has helped make lists of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall of 17% level of registering new voters in 2010, compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states, laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters, those who voted early were african, although the past accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with pseudo-academician from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike white, which, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted early were only 46%.
Of course, lawmakers Democrats and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws was vetirovano governors Democrats.
The most ambiguous laws was suspended when the intervention of the prosecutor general of the United States.
This enabled partly to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring interpleader photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules, joined the action, of course, make it extremely difficult to implement the right to vote in the election of 2012.
Criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws that have been adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the results of the 2012 election in key states.
Report centre Brennan from 2011 shows that states who accepted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with confidence that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.

Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the test for dog gives sometimes erroneous results, lzenegativnie, and sometimes lzepozitivnie that lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctantly undergoing dispanserizaciu, have something to hesitate, even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinions of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among groups of investigational, however the findings it is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time a European, found different level of mortality in patients who underwent screening, and those who have not passed.
The study also showed that after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of a metastasis at 30-40% higher for those who had not passed screening.
However, I would recommend pass the test since 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men achievers who also are at increased risk.
The key is making the right decisions, as the cancer is detected.
The cancer can be as aggressive and low-level.
The patient will need to clarify the extent of the risk of his cancer, offering him the options, without mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not harmful to life in the long term, but given the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many of the men who have detected cancer, will undergo treatment because their cancer was not aggressive and pose no threat to life.
We will they offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly we define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.
But it is important to consult with your doctor to determine whether it is necessary or not pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, movember created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of passing the test on the dog.
This document (while in English translation will be available in the near future) can be downloaded at: http: / / ca.movember.com / FR / mens: health / prostate cancer - - Screening …
Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, the a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is estimated that if all the people ate cool and quite moving, 30% of cases Rako could have been prevented.
"If no one smoked, this figure would have gone up at least 50%," said Andre stunning, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.
For Canadian Association of cancer struggle with smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous damage to the health of people.
"Even today in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," says spokesman Andre stunning.
Encouraging fact: ten years after stopping smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight of
According to the car, being overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," added to the association.
Food,
The Association also recommends that limit their consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancers of the colon.
Should avoid the sausages.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"Recent may harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," explains in the association.
The vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the impact of vitamin supplements to the development of cancer.
But for the moment, the results of these studies is not clear.
In the opinion of the SCC, studies of vitamin E given conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, while another gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also not fully clear.
But Mr. stunning stresses that their anxiety and family history, it is important to discuss with your doctor.
"Hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer."

Bozon boson in detail
Last summer the message that scientists may have managed to detect Bozon boson, caused a real boom – and not without reason.
It is believed that this Bozon explains mass of all of the particles in the universe, nothing a little.
Moreover, this is the latest particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model is our best, or, anyway, "the least imperfect" descriptions of nature and behavior of matter, but that hadn't been found by experience.
But physicists have still not sure that the question is about Bozon boson.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that she strongly resembles Bozon boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at one large physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it is confirmed, although for the complete confidence of some of the data still lacks.
Imagine all the same, that it is about Bozon boson, as the chances of mistaking seem minimal, and look at what this means.
There is, in this world of one law is absolutely inevitable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
To get around this rule there is no possibility, even don't try too hard, otherwise to harm himself.
But although the particle physics is a pretty strange world, it turns out that there is one law of similar nature: the Pauli exclusion, which posits that the two particles can't occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "a quantum state" this state is, in general terms, in some of its characteristics.
Based on this, the physics share particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called fermionami, who sensibly subject to the principle of Pauli.
In the other, the scurrying around the element, a stark a gang of anarchist who have no respect for anything – at least to this principle, which means that they can she would be in the same place at the same time.
According to website (by the way, is completely extraordinary) Particle adventure laboratory Berkeley, these element are divided, in turn, into two groups: meson, about which we say we will not, and the "particles force" through which apply the basic forces of nature and to which in some ways is Bozon boson.
These same element, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it's thanks to one incredibly banal Bozon: photon, or particle of light ," which is a courier of electromagnetic forces.
In fact, when one particle with an electrical charge is accelerating or changing direction, this violates the electromagnetic field in this particular place, like stone meets in the pond.
From this breach is born electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a photon – and, therefore, a ten-fold "super-spreaders" of force. "
More stable field
The same happens with Higgs boson, with the only difference that to this Bozon appeared to be violated different field, the boson.
However the boson much, much more stable electromagnetic field; to his institute, need to achieve very high energies, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface which could move only a very large stone.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, as the one that operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of the 27 km! "to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all the particles and not all materials interact with electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Likewise, not all the particles interact with the field and boson: those that interact with masses, while others (like the photon, by the way), it does not have.
So, what "can bring" all of these studies, asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to check the accuracy of the standard model (cm), and it also allows physicists find a divergence between the results of observations and predictions.
Besides, some of them passionately crave to this divergence was found, as the slightest discrepancy may open the door for "new physics" and plug some holes model.
The last, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, not offering any explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which generates approximately 80% of the universe (ouch, ouch!).
But so far at CERN such disparities have not found.
The consequences of
Benefit from these studies for the daily life of the average person, it is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research in the laboratories of Bell could not even guess what the revolution will cause them to work.
They envisioned their applications in science, but not more than that.
In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratories of Bell, where in 1960, the laser was invented, and which he developed the first continuous laser (previous were flashlamp-pumped) in 1962, said that initially the laser was seen rather as "design-and-integration gadget."
Imagine....
And in addition, the application may fall to instruments, accompanying the study.
For example, the same uilliard Boyle during their optical research in 1969, has developed a small sensor light.
This sensor, though this was not at all its original purpose, now serves as the eye for all digital cameras of the world and earned the Nobel Prize in physics, 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all may be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... / debt
In the commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate soon to be resumed, but at this time is preparing a bill.
Nevertheless, in this crucial area much remains to be done.
Debt tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived alone in his apartment in monterezi.
Prostate cancer, it from inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I have lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the runaway-house palliative care - Victor gadbua in Belykh, which arrived the day before.
"But it is always a shock to this it is impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease does its job: incredible weakness that does not give yourself to go to the toilet and even to eat.
Sitting at a table, which is a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees that he helped to eat.
Bodrit he even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him drugs, lead it in the bath.
Courage before the usual death.
"My greatest desire to me to be cured from diarrhea, it's humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this malaise.
"For the life of us are taught that a man must urinate while standing," says Pierre Broder, a psychologist in runaway-house victor - gadbua.
Regress to the condition of the child - for some an unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the person's ability to" come to terms with the decline, "he argues.
So how, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events sluchayaut and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who arrive in palliative chyorniy Victor - gadbua, all suffering from cancer.
Forecasts given them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses did not provide more assistance, called curatively.
Ms. L.A.Vesselaya, 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to get to know their children.
"I have good kids," she added.
"I want nothing in life," she says, before authorising put her mask, relieving breath.
She still awaits in the coming days the last visit his son, who had arrived from Italy.
In runaway-house Victor - gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can be done.
To make the death of more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 inhabitants one place in the institutions of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.
Then life goes on in the best conditions, any possible, explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors Priut.
Whether the comfort of physical, emotional or soul.
Dying we accept provide mouth mouthwash of brandy or Pepsi-Cola, watching what he will ask.
Diabetics we no longer make control sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer Mr. X., who died today at night.
On the morning of his son dopil this beer at his feet from the deceased.
"We help loved ones, as well as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of patient care.
In runaway-house Viktor - gadbua no one day is not like the previous one.
Next to 93 years old man who revels in his last meeting with the family in the yard, seated on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and all to survive.
"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy with cancer under the age of 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel concerned about.
53% of patients taken to a shelter - Victor gadbua, arriving from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, to care that is available to alleviate the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or at the orphanage.
And some institutions, such as shelter Viktor - gadbua society and palliative care at home a large Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors and specialists in palliative care to fear the law, an assisted death and help in suicide.
Since October, circulates manifesto signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, Dr. balfur Mount and Dr. Bernard lyapuant and endorsing their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not effective to secure the right to high quality palliative care, will be allowed to transfer euthanasia.
Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, who spent 14 days in the ambulance, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to help them.
I'm afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Helene Richard were already minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I reported my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said that she regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.
This she herself told me that my days were numbered.
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martell believes that 90% of patients who ask about death, thanking medical personnel, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the team on palliative care makes their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in struggle with the pain.
According to alsi Monroe, director of the palliative care in the community of palliative care at home a Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain in 8 percent of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps up to the moment of his death, or from time to time, or constantly.
Be more than to pretend that we don't know about these suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, can have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want to have an assisted death," which means "I want for me, it became easier."
The creation of this report was made possible thanks to a grant from the journalistic research institute health Canada.

Large-scale scandals with the real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for building roads, building contractors, the funding of political parties and specialists in Italian mafia day after day to tell what they know about the colossal system, construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
The industry, which is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"Curiously, as breaks down this system after both were put on it all means, jokes Žák, MP and former police chief Montreal."
It is thanks to him that in 2011 the scandal erupted as a by-product of the investigation officers crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, in which the prime minister of the time from liberals, Jean Charest, has agreed a very reluctantly.
"Report" established a direct link between industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only one ministry of transport has kept would billion dollars in contracts," if some were curbed his instincts to take share.
The commission Charbonneau "has already shifted two mayors," he adds, hoping that she could "open schemes behind individuals."
Permanent division to fight corruption, created in 2011
Council.specific joined created in 2011, the permanent unit to fight corruption, which included extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, members of the special unit hammer that after 2009 forced to "cartel" Montreal, stop the overstatement of the value of the contracts.
In recent weeks, has conducted a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular the franc and Enjoy surfing Will Richard markottu - the mayor of a small town, were charged in a fraud and corruption.
The queue - Gilles Vaillancourt, the recently retired from the post of mayor Lawal, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
His suspected incrustation receiving bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, the indictment had been charged with several engineers service railways Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
Last blew up a real bomb, after an investigation about the system of receiving government contracts.
Within a few years of Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts, in Montreal, a facilitator, connected with the mafia, which, in turn, to translate money Party mayor Gérald Tremblay "joint MCMXL."
In the 2000 ' s, Zambito Sori money right and left and he listed more than 88 million Canadian dollars (about 68 million euros) to various parties province, mostly liberals, was then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister, from the liberal party Nathalie Normando.
Sewer contracts, in which to overvalue cost
In Montreal, the system of corruption worked incredibly well.
Gilles surprenan, a former civil engineer, described in detail her before the panel: in the ten years he has received from construction firms gifts and invitations to travel to the golf tournaments, in restaurants, on the hockey matches and bribes for a total of 736 thousand dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that getting on the paw, accounts for 30-40% of using bogus additions.
Then one organizer from the party of the mayor, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget party vault of dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging MCMXL in deep crisis.
Chantal rulo was one of the first deputies in Montreal, alarm.
The mayor of the county from 17 de prari in the east of the island, she countered with the 2010 sale of municipal site, purchased for $5 million and pereprodannogo for... $1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be launched, she "potyanet for the plug to understand how a system, spawning ants to stop gangrene and identify those responsible."
This process she haracterezuet as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning wounds, but the city will require its own investigation team and observer to avoid a return of dubious practices.
As we get out home.
Regularly. "
Jacques notices for its part, that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially his worried about the role of the "elected officials who knew about this scheme, ” but is not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was just a pale reflection of the reality."
The government of Quebec offers limit to 100 dollars of donations to parties, but, he said, it would not change the situation: "until we will strictly limit elective spending, in politics are dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and financing parties: "we can't go below; boldly firstly in essence of things, we will be able to build a house on more solid foundations, with the best control and legality."
If this story and casts shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. urges those who laughs, look in your own backyard.

"PSG is not of FC Barcelona!"
This season you in psg have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by an individual consciousness, but it could - and the new measurement psg.
Profit the great players.
Next to them I am growing every day.
Technicians also brought a lot of things.
These factors make me daily to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it is easier.
In football everything is happening very quickly.
But I am not raspalyaus.
From the outset in the centre of the provisional training in NIF in clerfontene and to my parish in St. Etienne I always Chagall forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition, by Carlo Ancelotti...
Recruits this summer is not new in playing matches on a very high level.
They also know that every training session is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, is eager to be at the level and attention to the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning.
He helps such deputy, as Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspire respect to the technical staff.
Today in the first league he has no equal, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with VX735 clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January I had with him was hopeful the conversation.
Then I moved from a series of injuries.
The trust, which he renders me, also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season psg?
In the first league, Lyon took we have a leader.
But we are still ready.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we spectacularly qualify in one eighth final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
Now all can be.
We will be able to say his word face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, before Porto, to be able to take the return match in the final.
Whether psg become a top European club in the short term?
He has to do this already have the budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and consolidate the position of a long-term perspective.
Today it is not so.
Financially from psg have the means to make the project viable.
Not take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are valid ardently want to win this championship title.
Last season we were to this close.
In May, it was disappointment, because we had all to come to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played even more fantastic season.
This year, I think, everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that in the fight for the title have entered such strong team, as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media waiting for too much from psg?
It is normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we buy the house BWS-D-4-0 against Andre Vingt-Trois and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what the first expect us to people.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of BWS-D-4-0.
We are not of FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the project of the game.
The team is formed with time.
We proved in the Champions League, that we can respond to the challenges we face today.
Look at Manchester United, which is already two season fails to pass in one cop-2 the final, although they too have spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amount, we were 15 points ahead of already for winter half-time.
This would be a disdain for our opponents and timed to France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not at the height of last season, were awakened this new psg.
This shows how great the first league.
I hope that in May, we will be able to smile and tell myself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
PSG, it seems, entirely depends on the feats Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
And that, if they say that there is a certain zlatanozavisimost.
It only means that ibragimovich very successful and that he scored a lot of goals.
He came to this and he proves that he is a star of the first of the league.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround it.
What he did, it is really only.
This stimulates and others to improve their game.
Tyago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
As you have experienced Euro 2012 against France?
As disappointment.
I earnestly wish to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a bit of game time.
There I have seen many things, and I came out stronger.
Today I manage to play a good selection of the matches.
This is what I had hoped since my baptism in blue.
We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and must now behave centres.
What do you think about the first months of Didier led blue?
They are for him successful.
He has a good position in qualifying group for the World Cup.
He was strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has reached his goal, he qualified us into the euro.
Hope that Didier Deschamps will lead blue in Brazil.
Good Honored draw (1-1), virvannaya October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match gave us belief in themselves.
Each had fought for all.
Prior to this shock in Spain, in my career was no such matches.

Pay and sell without the aid of banks – with you
The complete opposite of the current currency exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between the parties receiving C commission fees on their treatment.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, obviously political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, you, invented Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure protocol exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files between participants one level.
About 200,000 operations has already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand websites take for donations or as a means of payment.
Course, reaching a maximum 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before to return today to about ten dollars (rates are quoted on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared with the global exchange real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report about the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes as "the most successful virtual currency," "rival the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Bitcoin different from other types of virtual currencies, as loans used for promotion in a video game that is earned during the game or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the operations are always controls and handles any central authority.
In all parts of the network are simultaneously holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers Exchange, pokupatelimi and sellers.
As is this network?
Each transaction between two users actually happens between two electronic addresses, like e-mail.
The only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction, signed by e-mail, using encryption system with a double switch.
The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, perhaps check that used in the transaction really exist in public Accounting book, presidential across the network.
Key stage is the registration of new transaction in this book.
She passes through the decision of the mathematical tasks presidential computers, which decided that, like a temporary central bank, gets privilege add this new line.
It is a phase of hashing file, i.e. converting a large file in digital signature, a short and unique.
Computers take new autoactivity and add her room, before all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros in the beginning).
As soon as this number found, other sites to check that it properly.
Transaction thus turns nerarzrivno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change digital signature.
If to cheat the user very fast (less than ten minutes) wished would pay twice one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signature.
Computer, which decided the task, receives 50.
To avoid inflation, award-in regularly is divided in half, probably until the end of 2012.
Number of 5,596,984 however limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one that leaves another reserve...
The complexity of the tasks also increases with the computing power.
Life of the network has already experienced the ups and downs.
Sites that provide services you, have been attacked, and were stolen from the reserves.
"Used defect does not apply to the protocol," says Pierre nuaza, who recently launched paymium company sets payments real money using a network of you.
The ECB also reported about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also have this flaw.
Big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as blogging platform WordPress, their permit.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorith Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the Accounts book and found that almost 80% of not be in circulation.
"Giant sales-outs" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," glad Jon holmkvist working in coinabul, which is involved in converting in gold.
Pierre nuaza, another author of the allowances for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as operating the network.
His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of credit cards (in real money) or contact-less payment via mobile phone, but she uses you to check transactions, which thus cheaper.
The owner of better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs, which do not need to install new hardware or software.
Enough only to report the address, which can be "photograph and recognize the" phone, Dneprospesstal Pierre nuaza worry, because he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"Before you establish ourselves, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to reconsider a variety of risks that are supposedly today elevated, in the case of success of this system.

We have gone from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (capisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans must follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to retake control of its own territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only on us.
From us suffered mostly Afghan peasants, which we regard as terrorists.
And we will, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and pokalechennimi.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, the former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies, as it was when the USSR.
They want to protect their own traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Them suffer, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer be as soon as the West becomes behave more delicately.
Withdrawal of French troops from bases Nijrab, who I watched from the height of the hills zones with almond trees thanks to the French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul, without being attacked by.
With the end of 2014, the invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible promotion from 1994 to 1996.
While Kabul was empty, the country was in the fire and blood from a struggle between the various factions.
Time-chartering them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for bigotry these farmers, in which their surpassed Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved, and in our time.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate status.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They are turned into operatives, exciting public lands to resell them for housing immigrants, returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using huge American contracts subcontract.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, even themselves not fought.
People, as I've heard in rural areas, they want a government that was not from thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed to American generosity: outflow substantial.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantage.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people, who do not want to return to bigotry old parties, no to corruption of some leaders.
Everything, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment the army is.
Authorities, which will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, conducting anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking measures to restore the provincial milícias who would not abide by the central authorities.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent decentralized, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the constitution 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the elections, scheduled for April 2014.
But his country since the 1950s, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
The industry was not delivered on its feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is not repaired.
All imported; nothing is done, except for fruit and vegetables.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by 30 years of war, state control over the infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to their boss.
Without energy for processing iron ore or copper on the spot, without the means of transportation to their export through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese already almost left the copper deposit 1h2004, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) dig into the huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary to one day equal way Afghanistan and Pakistan from which to a large extent, depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on November 20.
The new agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: school for girls, for boys, the faculty of French language at the university, the French institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to win the "hearts and minds" and perform impossible, task of combining aid with offensive operations, the "military and civilian activities" at the Ministry of Defense (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, along with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive involvement of the local workforce, could help to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and increase the area of arable land.
That we leave on the memory of himself, having spent two billion euros to military spending?
A much more modest budget has promoted would improve living conditions for the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of the small agricultural work emanating from local communities in Kapisa.
To get rid of the uprisings, led by foreign groups that wish to farmers as they told me, you need to give them a little non-military support, which would be well under the control and came to him directly.

Heavy birth of Egypt ' s constitution
Is a new risky step of President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, he decided to play the all-in.
Outposts all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text on the next day.
Exactly a week ago the head of the state Assembly has provided two additional months to finish the job.
Soon two years as Egypt relies on preliminary text, which amended several times, that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal conflicts.
This new initiative is only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "violate this word" and "flout the right."
In the camp of his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the process of transition.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which makes the brothers to abandon intentions to explain to Egyptians text, article after article.
For the president it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, seems convinced that Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in one interview with the weekly time.
The more that the call to fast-track voting resembles the ultimatum the Egyptian people: "or you vote for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers," which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals not responded the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights activists, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
To the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the brothers - Muslims.
It is no wonder that in most cases, the articles were progolosovany unanimously.
Commentators, incidentally, amused by the fact that one of the few differences of the day emerged around... time for prayer, because some members of the committee thought that watches the constituent assembly were incorrectly configured.
The text, which yesterday was still voting, consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 ultimately remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, reading that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, had hoped to replace the principles on rules that would enable them to more rigorous application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed, is a testament to their goodwill and respect to other members of the Egyptian society.
Hypocrisy, say the liberals, who see in this only public relations.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the constitution is happening through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives the university Al-Azhar advisory role, particularly in regard to verify compliance with sharia law.
According to specialist in Egypt Sophie pe, it is worrisome, to "people to make decisions, not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of theocracy. "
Many liberals, moreover, excited fact that the rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.
"At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this the constitution we remain within the civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on this text, is not ulema, and people with a university education, some were taught in the French system ” – soothes Alexis Blom, which prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around article 220 may arise ambiguity, as used in her terms borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to fiqh [Islamic jurisprudence, masculine ed.].
And in the future may be wondering how civilian judges competent to make a decision about this. "
In addition to their religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives wide powers to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood say they have significantly reduced compared with those which have been under the old regime.
Another moot point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be held not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.
Also not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the pleas of associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider subversive for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and henceforth forbidden insult that could have serious implications for freedom of expression, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles no longer speaks about protecting women, emphasizes winter moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive note is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
Word which does not appear in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was to speak last night on television, then rallies are planned today in the afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"The great and mighty" to Moscow over: migrants will save money for language
While lawmakers and human rights activists argue that will give the law on mandatory language testing in the country have already emerged fraudsters selling fake certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million gastarbeiters.
For the most part the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left at home.
From December 1, came into effect a law, under which each migrant will be obliged to pass on knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, and retail trade.
But overtime, "promise in FMS, tests will become mandatory for all travelers.
Handslide rent will have not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of language will have to verify and to obtain, and to renew work permits.
An exception is only valid for the citizens of those countries where English is the official language.
Not subject to the law and the people who have to get certificates and diplomas about education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The benefits are doomed and protection of rights
Network examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language of Pushkin, university narodov, MSU, spbsu and other institutions of higher learning.
Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all cities; now in Russia have opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative on the introduction of testing supported gosduma deputies and FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into effect, many times in the press had time to ask the question: what is it, in fact, give?
That change the obligation of knowledge of the language and for Russians, and for the visitors?
First of all, is to meet representatives of the migration service, "this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor slavery. "
Very many say now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the office of FMS in Tajikistan Victor sebelev.
Protection of their rights should begin before their departure.
Only system organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
The problems appear at migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding of language is sure sebelev, future migrant doomed face unfair people who under the guise of helping vsunut him start in a terribly close Barack, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents, vkalywaya for 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one thing, and on arrival they cheated, select a passport, not pay out the promised wages," confirms chief labor migration ms tadzhikistan tolib Sharipov.
Not cursing, nalnika!!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, recognised that not only do not know the language of the country, which aspire to, but also on their own kind of write with difficulty.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, how much trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even sensible primary education.
Because their families can't even feed the children, not to mention how to properly wear them, shoes and snaryazat to school.
Dorastaya to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity to go to work.
It is difficult, if poorly with knowledge of the language, they confess.
"You feel humiliated and deficient."
True, in respect of the law on language of human rights activists point out one important moment.
The testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the same status not - there will be no prom, no further official work.
Meanwhile, most of the gastarbeiters still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or outsiders" no entrance for "
Many of the visitors claim that to get official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is the bureaucratic barriers and all those same language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization is worth the money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But false registration can be done quickly and for just one and a half thousand.
The Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists citizen tadzhikistan umed.
," Not scrimp, buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it was revealed that false there are not only migrants documents about registration.
Several fake certificates on the language tests have already seized by FMS.
Fake paper printed on the usual color printer.
Of course, they got new owners are not for nothing: each of migrants, hoping thus relieve myself the task of passing the tests, paid for document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than two times more expensive procedures of official testing: it will cost 27.08.2008 migrant in three thousand.
The fact that the main challenge in the near future - to protect the system from corruption to brown it was impossible to simply buy, agree and representatives of the authorities, and human rights defenders.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise to guest workers who are unable to successfully undergo testing the first time, the time to examine basic language course.
In addition, the newcomers, not knowledge of Russian, will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.

The interior takes no turnover of illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legal weapons extremely small
The ministry's offers to tighten the law against the owners of the civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when no victims, and slaughter moskovskoye lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which the press were killed seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of travmatici in public places and raise the age from which you can get a license for the weapon - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea supported the head of the Duma committee on security and counter corruption Irina winter and promised that amendments to the law about weapons can contribute to the state duma in the near future.
Not all are pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to wrestle with the problem by "tightening the screws."
Network appeared in an open letter, the authors whose representatives of the different public rifle organizations require to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with the registered weapons minimal, said the Russian service BBC lawyer - Oxygen Forensics Basiliy forest rangers.
According to the interior ministry, for six months of 2012 Belgrade-radio 142 crimes involving firearms registered in the interior, while just over the same period there were 1168 thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter assured that tighter legislation in the area of civil weapons not put offenders to go to the black market.
Now, they said, in Moscow, you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, in the interior ministry argue that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The black market weapons updated on several channels.
Major such channels five, said retired Col. Victor Baranets, ten years who worked in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the Joint Staff.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is "army or military footprint" that is a weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapon was dragged and Russian officers, and they themselves," says Baranets.
The kind of "black weapons" - saleloot criminals have representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes and gone with police warehouses, and stolen from directly to law enforcement officers.
Illegal suticases go on sale from military warehouses.
On many military warehouses often oftena explosions.
"There are proven version that part of the arsons were made specifically to cover a shortage," says a former military.
Its contribution, according to Barantsev, there--read weapons manufacturers.
"Now get divorced private arms factories that do not stand up to competition in the international market and emit weapons from under the floors on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of black market - smuggling.
Especially many Promtehmontazh pistols and rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is production, sometimes primitive, and formed the mafia, which organized the flow," explains a former military.
Where weapons?
Experts thought, what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this in 2011, prepared the troubled analysis and state management of design.
Experts analyzed the statements of the interior ministry and Rosstat, kriminologichescuu literature and open data portals on Oruzheinaya.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "at the hands of officials, whose work is linked to weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases the weapons come from places of armed conflicts, and in 14 percent of cases occur theft at the stage production of weapons, 5% fall on "black archaeology."
The seller is a consultant to one of the weapons stores, who asked not to be identified, claims that weapons, found black onion digger, has long nobody buys is too old.
Most often, as he says, for the new party sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through the utility man buys unit, for example a gun.
He discharged her, pass through the fence.
"He carries it in the city and sells to 900 euros a piece with two shops," he says
"The truth is, the police informed of all cases, however occasionally when core-angry plan for solving crimes, a supervisory purchases from merchants illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"As in a luxurious shop"
The seller and the buyer most often are finding each other through friends.
I looked into the sites, blogs, not yet responded comrade, who proposed to arrive at the platform racing, where will the man taking me in the corner, where we will bargain.
The price of the barrel, I learned only there
Victor Baranets military observer
To get fellow-creature I need a friend who has a way out, "says the seller is a consultant - I have a friend, but I'm in it, I'm not sure.
Sellers in the markets, but there, too, need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to convey that she is a daughter of a tooth out."
I'm now even a couple of castetow took out a person, in which I am sure.
He, too, their supplies only me, because he knows that I could not rent.
Newcomers are looking for weapons different ways.
Former military victor Baranets tried himself in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
The scheme, he said, have not changed.
He gave the album with photographs, where there was "anything."
"I felt like in a luxurious store," recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Barantsev, do not offer a pig in a poke – all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - we went with the seller in the forest, they put a target.
"I give the opportunity to shoot, and when I made sure that weapons beats well, begin to bargain," describes the procedure expert.
Shop on the couch
The search engines on the Internet posting on sites and groups in vKontakte, where offer to buy weapons "for different things."
It does not need any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising hat--trains on the site "buy combat rifle or machine."
The users leave their applications and asking questions.
Minors and sell?
"Without a license, of course," asks the user Ivan (sic).
"Buy tt.moskva" tersely formulates fedorencov request.
The federal security service, now razbrosila huge network of sites, and those wishing to buy 2rep weapons rowing by a shovel.
People go, like a hungry fish on pricormku, and then mined coal in Siberia
Military observer and former military victor Baranets
I heard about such schemes: usually the site registered beyond Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through the ATM make payment.
"In response, sending the photo and instruction, where the hidden weapons," said a spokesman for the "right to arms" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets argues that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get behind bars.
The federal security service, now razbrosila huge network of sites, and those wishing to buy 2rep weapons rowing by a shovel.
"People go, like a hungry fish on pricormku, then mined coal in Siberia," he argues.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, experts estimate that we can meet in the amount of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the "right to arms," Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
Will have to wait for a month and a half.
He is from the warehouses of long-term storage leadership of these warehouses middle managers.
According to the official stastistice desectionments, compared with January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia fell by 7% and accounted for 22.9 of thousands, and the number of detected cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices fell by 7.8%.

In the US, supermarkets and fast-food workers go on strike
Through work on SNAO McDonald goes up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days for America, a wave of protests against low wages in department stores corporations walmartrecently and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald, "burger king," "Bell's tacos," uandis and "Kentucky fraid Chicken."
So far, no one is predicting whether this surge in the ninth shaft or she is to expire in the early stages.
Stocks supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries, which receive ordinary employees of Walmart and a system of fast food, the purpose of the organizers of protests is the creation of the trade union organizations.
While this sector of the economy almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents in a year?
Stocks began last week, after a day of thanksgiving, in the so-called "black Friday," when America has fallen orgy deshevykh sales, annexed the millions of people in the street and sometimes accompanied by Mina Zayed Port Authority.
On this day, some workers walmartrecently Corporation, in which around the world, employs 2.2 million people left their jobs and picketed together with trade unions and left-wing activists shops corporations, whose goods subtracts the people on modest and middle incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries before vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores on average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
However many low-wage workers walmartrecently come only at their work.
Accessibility and range of goods made walmartrecently one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap partly because few pays its employees.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, for example, on the lack of trucks or hand scanners.
Participants of the shares in the "black Friday" required to increase wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical worker walmartrecently, receive 9.5 dollars per hour, this rashod.pravda not afford, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart Ordabasy srednuuu salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the corporation at 3.2 billion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it spends on salary now.
If Walmart entirely shift wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the shop will do them all on 46 cents more expensive.
For a year they will spend on any 12,39 dollars more than it is now.
Supporters walmartrecently fairly note that protests have occurred only in nine states and not corporations or damage.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores with 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of its cash registers produced in "black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Representative Dan Fogelman Corporation claimed in an interview with the left-wing site the huffington post that jobs have left a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just a "another deadline-driven stunt" organized crimes and its trade union.
"Free tickets!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city does not favour, and so their lyrics are not yet), and McDonald and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you the hospital and not paying you for honest work!
Williams, a member of the city council of New York
At the moment the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants in time her increase, but not much, and their average ordinary workers receive in new york 8,90 dollars per hour.
Less of them in this expensive city not earning no one.
How can you live in New York for the money, for me, is incomprehensible.
Once through McDonald took place almost a quarter of American teenagers who the job for them to function after school, living with parents.
Few people saw it as a main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly coming across an interview with workers McDonald, who complain that must live on that salary and sometimes even feed on her children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal newspaper hangeth comment, whose author notes that irresponsibly kids, if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The protests, which began at 6: 30 a.m. in the morning on Thursday at McDonald on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and the cooks fast food system began to pay a minimum of $15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum salary.
They also demanded that in the fast food were created by trade union organizations.
American law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish activists trade union movement was harassed and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life.
But cover union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons.
One of the main "extraordinary turnover of staff.
The dissenters
Noisy protests took place in this day and have a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day meeting with mcdonald's near Times Square, which is made by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Williams, who said: "McDonald's says he sells billions of servings, and after that he didn't even give you the hospital and not paying you for honest work!."
The demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de Blasio, who said "we must all join in support of workers fast food so that they have achieved a fair payment and economic prosperity, which deserves every new!."
Described as the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But in bymore only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid public, which in New York, employs tens of thousands of people.
While it is unclear whether this would create a spark the flames of the mass movement.

"As long as the fool the brain turns out medium"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality has lately been seen mostly through the prism of special glasses.
First summer at its annual conference the current model showed Google, and then in November it was reported that the application for the patent filed, and Microsoft.
But from the conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in laboratory Microsoft balls Izadi follows that for scientists this company glasses - the time passed.
Their tempting prospect dash-dot virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
Tell us, please, in general terms, what does your research group?
"We are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
Until mankind in the mass of apple at the stage of working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes ticanya in them with his finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this collaboration.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, because all the interesting zestovoe management.
"That still waiting for us ahead?
"Despite the fact that the Kinect had interaction on a physical level, much still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Enter information improved (the system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.
We are trying to change this, working on a three-dimensional systems display on the basis of different technologies, including proectivnikh.
Need to release a computer world in our, physical, to make it a more palpable.
For this, however, need to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality!
"What do you think about the voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate whether her?
"It's definitely not a panacea - the question of privacy because they don't always want to inform others about their actions and intentions.
In fact all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places we had a project in which we thought on gestures, but not above verbose, and over such stingy, short.
The gestures were not the camera device, and wrist bracelet, which recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
While he is a big, but in theory it could be reduced to the size of the wrist watches.
But in general the future for mixed type of management, for example, a gesture of + voice.
Is how?
"For example, as you ask me to give you this bank soda?
You say and at the same time show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
"You want to get users to adapt under what may or may not at the moment the machine?
"Absolutely not necessarily, but it is the mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors, which will allow more precisely define human reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution for depth, this is very important.
"If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, do you have any pretensions to modern cameras?
Lacks permission, depth or something?
"In principle the current generation is what can make a start in our work over trivariate recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 to / from.
But it is not in the megapixels, and as a matrix and depth.
With the latest point of view of all current technologies for us not good enough – it adds to the work of designers algorithms.
That is, we need to remember not only about a resolution on axes X and Y, and Z.
Is also very important the speed, the number of frames per second.
Movement of a man quite dynamic, and the current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen from our lab did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60 to 100) index.
Not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would in my work is very useful for the equivalent of such a device, not only requires touch to frames per second was more.
"And the number of cameras increase not need to?
The Kinect now have three cameras, one of which actually - infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected signal.
And now a third camera is, actually, a typical sensor visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially greater number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it, increasing the required volume of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible similar to Kinect, play with curved location cameras and see how this will help in determining the provision.
"As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses.
You don't think that in terms of day-to-day use technologies augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
"Of course, all the slob around, holding a smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the best option would be financed is supplemented by reality, when based on the cloud platform you could switch to glasses on a smartphone, a projection screen and then everywhere.
Glasses is a very personal device, in that their strength (Suurtuki things you see only you), and simultaneously weakness, which is supplemented by reality based on the points will not allow you to work on the virtual objects together with other people.
"Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony stark from the" iron man ," but an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which often indicate critics of such ideas: no tactile feedback!
Hands nothing feel!
What answers your group prepares to this challenge?
In his lectures I often say that accompanied the reality is the seventh to score a breakthrough in the interaction of man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be additive of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a substrate for the image.
She perfectly registers clicking!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving here are the pictures in the air "circulating – for example, electrons several targeted ultrasound beams to a certain point, where is your finger, gives a sense of, but it is very weak – as if you are blowing on the pads.
There and bracelets on the wrist that affect nerve endings in the fingers are also promising direction.
But have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels that vainness must feel at the moment when he sees something?
"This is a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.
Here lies another task on which to beat for a long time - how to make a man, physically located in a very limited space, believe that he is on an open, almost infinite - work and above concepts jogging (no such as the clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balloons.
While fool the brain turns out medium, work is still very much for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality such attractive to researcher - many things in its infancy.

Instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Scientist continues to project "Petersburg avangarde" dedicated to the townspeople, who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
At the top of the list are already bright firures art scenes of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are beyond the scope of the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national prominence.
A new hero scientist - Pentagram artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, which meets the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the fashionable parties and Vernisage.
Paintings Kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators, where they would not exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of typi-cally'Alpinisme social and philosophical Fabler, the creators of the new mythology.
Kirill Miller is a bright man st.-petersburg advant-guard the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, their appearance on the streets causing a smile among the citizens to rise up the mood.
He recently took in the hands of and became Petersburg, as ripe for this complex role of all its bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
By Kirill, and why are you still go through the city around the red rather than yellow or turquoise, for example?
"I chose the red as a fashion designer, appearance and image.
In this world of red is a compromise between an artist, and society.
Although in a society all that slightly not grey, causes aggression and agitation the malign properties.
But my provocations aimed at making the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative shares – an invitation to debate.
"And when you realized that to be an artist?
"The exhibition in Moscow, where they were exposed to my work.
I realized that this is my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists has gone, and new, free like me were unclear.
I began to make friends with the artists and new wave, with that led to "convertion 10," and more waves was not.
I get to the theater, the clothes, the music of all genres, in addition to words.
"And it's all come together in your art clinic..." it was important to find yourself in the culture of the city, where he must meet all the best creative forces.
In 1995 I took the territory on Pushkin - 10, and there, as long as there was no repair, there was a musical and artistic club, bohemian club house Westerbeke bohemian.
Many there were born: Noma, Tequila jazz, remember ux-cd led with the project, "van Gogh's ear."
Cord and his friends sang under the veneer light song, they were in tights, among them was a trendy now composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band has played live, she became leningrad.
Trahtenberg was leading many programs to hahli - galivskih times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went to his great career, and basic education and upbringing he we have received.
Gallery "Mostera 137," club "MDCCCXXVIII is Vsevolodovich from art clinic.
There our employees and the habitués left.
I the hero of the last century, when culture something mean.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the award was "the people of our city."
In the "artist of the year" was named I ended my the culmination of.
In new times by the old rules uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years, easily become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"Your work is characterized by recognizable style.
"Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and the sharpness.
Will I have a software-problem exhibition, “Russian Museum in clown."
Clowns is timeless category.
I previously social was now be so is a painful and scary.
But in clown all spread, but the tragedy is shot.
I love the grotesque, I have grotescovie ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by a totalitarian cabins to cooperate.
Now on odezhke Vstrechayut targeting foreign mechanics, not on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand to be and with a spit.
And fraud will be filmed using the cabins.
"But recently we saw you in the role of urban. - cultural city should have such a hero.
To whom, as not for me, they will be.
Well can and commercial art can be a beautiful?
"Now the commercial art should be neat, considerate, sweet.
Is disintegration crops.
People used to crowded pack, eat one loved, the simplest of another.
Now all crashed on, now it is hard to enjoy it all.
I am not stodollarowaya paper that everyone likes.
Now need to think who will be like.
Now every cult hero to 100 fans.
"And on Stasa mikhailau comes as several thousand!
At him come, sexo there is the social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds of 300 people will come, and 10,000 not come, and ultimately less management, money, everything dies.
I have fans, the main thing is they don't cheat, don't spoil their possessions.
I was in the youth wrote such paintings that one collector they are on the wall beside Falchi Larionov and hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Is now often confuse.
They say: the culture of spiritual, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption has, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of drawing pictures.
I am for this is the culture.
By Kirill, which lacks 090501001?
A good cultural experts.
There is such a concept: an official from the culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
With the right tsars all is not as it was, the kings, may not really understand the culture, but they understood that we need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow is now good consultants.
We have people in there that could be the experts, but they closed, as need higher experts who correctly will appreciate these experts and will give them the road.
Now flourishes.
The same ararta, but their primarily--though that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept that there are some artists who must look for the other museums.
"What's for you - St.-Petersburg?
St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow culture is much more, where the soil is.
And on our stones art--acquaintance grow difficult.
We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, it is wrong.
Here in Europe very many people. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of thin.
We need to make fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on the grant funds St.-Petersburg

Give birth to in space
Land in danger.
Global warming or a collision with the asteroid is a killer.
Caravans spacecraft with Earthman on board go in search of spare the planet.
To save humanity, raising the question of how to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact these planets only two that you can explore at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," said senior researcher of the state institute for astronomy name p.k. Sternberg () Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus – temperature 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approach to matters of reproduction in space started with flora.
Even half a century ago, conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations raised on orbit peas were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then the spacecraft in orbit insects, tiny fruit flies, fruit flies.
In 1979 in space have sent eggs perepeloc to check, as the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get at the exit is absolutely normal young bird.
But further begins the problem.
"The problem with the fact that this nestling should find support, he should get back on their feet and start moving," explains head of laboratory institute of biomedical problems (IMBP) vol.9 Vladimir sichev.
Not finding support, the chicks randomly rolled around.
And after 10 hours of infants therea full atrophy instincts.
The chicks not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that, through four days they just died.
"And two times we viluplyali chicks, after it refused to, because simply cannot be there with them to work," notes the failure of the experiment with birds in space Vladimir sichev.
With animals last time the biological minikovtcheg flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
However on biosputnike Bion will only same-sex individuals.
Was an experiment with rats that sent into space is already with the fruit.
In principle, there is nothing supernatural not found.
"It's just been on biosputnike, but again is a single experiment, and such studies have to spend," said Vladimir sichev.
After landing from space rats appeared posterity.
But approach the problem of over-multiplication directly in space until it turns out.
Easy task.
Animals, losing, their customary habitata, simply can't realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike the animal, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create a consistent emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out.
But women in space travel is already 50 years old.
The biggest risk was at tereshkovoy.
But the most precious that have humanity, is a woman's body.
Our seagull flew, and no one on earth could not say whether it will survive after the flight into space.
Whether she will be able to give birth to a child after this flight.
"On this question no one answered," says veteran of the rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan kherson-nikolaev also was a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana conditions, twice in orbit and even elaboration in outer space, my son was born.
But the risk remains.
We have very little unit Tetraodon astronauts that after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation.
"And if more, this is dangerous even for orbital flights," summarizes cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union, the hero of the Russia's Valery Polyakov.
And yet, the humanity to look for any new path in biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating artificial gravity.
Gidrolaboratoria rgnii - mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here in the neutral buoyancy test-cosmonaut puchberg skills working in open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If adult water, albeit studio.The, but still alien environment, for infants - native element.
Small ihtiandri if confirmed - life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between what the baby is around 9 months with his mother in fluid, it is easier to get on then to water.
In principle this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first bathing, is only 2 weeks.
"This is very little to something to forget," says instructor grudnichkovogo swimming Marina axenova.
In short, if a child born to a more natural state of weightlessness, for women - necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness dryahleut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls ability to tidal the fetus.
Well okay, skip and it is, relying on stimulants generic activities.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, she chasing him.
"And then what?" asks not trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need an artificial gravity.
No sense of gravity, the body does not form a skeletal and muscular system.
Newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a suit for additional training.
He simply will be deprived of that he will be vital.
"And this experiment, in which we go, having admitted the birth of a baby in the alien environment, will lead to what we bring to the ground with a disability, fully dezadaptirovannogo person," foresees the head of the committee on bioethics IMBP vol.9 Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a question the theory.
However, later the time it will be a reality, when earthlings on their ships mentione on a distant planet, which will become home to their descendants, born in space.

Head of the main security auditing department: checking Schwartz - system failed at the hands of politicians.
In the field of public procurement Czechia has good control authorities and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav pakhsa, vice president of the supreme security audit management, from an interview for the website aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but apply it should properly, which, in my opinion, we have not enough," commented on the current situation pakhsa.
Such conclusions provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices use-causes Petr Nečas approach to the so-called Schwartz - system.
Recently, the prime minister said that the GFC (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - leaves it is prohibited or allowed to?
"The law should be in any way set, and if it is something prohibits, and the prime minister can't resist the work of agencies, who are required to verify and to meet its obligations," stated pakhsa.
At a meeting of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which was associated legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
The parallel test, which we began, perhaps, two years ago.
Simply put, talking about the fact that European legislation says, how should receive public procurement, followed by national legislation and then also use in practice.
All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished d.arago., there were interesting differences - simply put, the legislation we can be "accurate and defaultless," but in practice we in certain parameters are behind Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, should focus on the application of the law.
But actually as this project can help you that he was mean to you?
That is the kind of joint control may contribute to efforts to stop atualizações laws, cutting and improving restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means getting the appropriate thing for the reasonable (but not always) low price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve this by lowering the limit orders.
Perhaps this system perepolnit papers so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find them much easier than if the restriction is not dropped.
You talk about internal problems of the practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
But as a system of control in Germany?
Is there a the organization as our chickens (security the audit management) or it works differently?
As for the institutions, there as our chickens CSIRT Bundesrechnungshof, arranged on our principle, there is also the board, which operates a bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the authority to some extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there are divisions of audit and on the level of federal lands in their system of several different from our own.
BRH can manage only the federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the level of federal calculation chambers.
As for local laws, there are simpler than we have?
In general, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany you can take a sample, but you can't say definitely that it better in all.
This is so, because they are better at dealing with the control?
Definitely not, but again, I like the comparisons don't like.
But I have to say that even the main countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, as reflected in your facility amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow treatemnts consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it is not in our control.
As we spend control in fact, it is necessary to consider some of the delay.
Take this into account only in the process of training of future inspections "we started to use our new tool to detect risk neakonnosti," through which we were taken away almost 14,000 government contracts have them analyzed. there, of course, these changes will emerge, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope, it is confirmed.
The problem that can occur is that rules tighter and it will be impossible to follow.
Under the previous rules controlled entities are related to suppliers (for example, regional operational programs - from the regional council) that any failure of the law on public procurement means violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in this case, the enforcement of the law in this way?
I think that is not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit a formal error not influencing the decision.
Such a system only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then to get out of this situation?
Let's recognize that this path will lead you to nowhere.
Recently the prime minister has said that it will not disturb entrepreneurs checks so-called Schwartz - system... what does it mean?
"Schwartz - the system" is prohibited or allowed?
The law should be in any way set, and if it is something prohibits, and the prime minister can't resist the work of agencies, who are required to verify and to fulfill their commitments.
You can say: "we reverse this law and solve this," but you cannot say that will pretend that nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains a fairly strict rules, and that must formally held, and it is right that protects public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer disqualified just because of technical flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we have not enough.

Shimon ornest: the concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than a month to come the end of the world?
This is just one of the many disturbing news on which we, the people, so easily farther apart.
Together with the band The tap tap we constantly kidding on this subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concert against the end of the world.
Could you explain more about the readers?
It is about a national fundraising event, which we plan to for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential, which possesses the Mayan calendar, the end of which is announced on December 21 at 11: 10.
The day before the event, the 20th December in 21: 00 parallel start three concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They come to an end, roughly speaking, at the moment when on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, the time zone in which 12 hours earlier than we have over Mayskiy calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with together with our art-designer Agusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to build up enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to, together with the public think about the condition of the world once we pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of May the calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from Shine, t-shirts, bags and original key against the end of the world... these things can be bought on the website development "tap.cz and thereby also to offer us support.
Group The tap tap along with other musicians and also sang the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
Sounds whether already fancied by trainees-doctors filmnet anthem on his virtuosity of these gigs?
Of course, in the end, if in the end it will all work out and the end of the world will not come.
It will assemble all the performers all the concerts at the same time.
Hymns simultaneously ring also aired a Czech television.
The words to that song wrote and played the role of Jesus in video tomash Ganak, participates in the performance also xindl X...
As you started to cooperate with them?
We also collaborate with other boys Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charitable events and concerts.
Actively try to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many would like to work with us, they are interesting.
The proceeds from the concert will go against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for bezbariernogo Educational Centre studeo, already the sixth year, we are working with civil association of tap at the institute Jedliczka.
Teachers regularly attend school students institute Jedliczka and spend with them funny and interesting activities.
Have the students do not have the means to go to teachers, and we feel so give them the opportunity.
The project of the additional construction institute Jedliczka in the future there will be a separate building, in which we moved with this project.
At every concert performing several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to draw up a program that will be of interest to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, support lesbiens, illustratosphere with dan Barta, The tap tap, Marjan bango and Jiri Suchý.
About all the details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan to any such "grandiose event" in the future?
In May, will for the first time to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, to prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would have gladly held view in the Czech national house in New York, and I personally, if we will be in the US, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group The tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with the road from the point of view of the organization and logistics??
It is not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, strollers them to fly in the cargo hold of, plus a large amount of cargo and mailboxes with instruments.
Nevertheless, so far, to deal with this without problems. Czech Airlines čsa and British airlines British Airways have always been great for us prepared that surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without problems.
Thanks to participate abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward disabled people, and so on.
With what you faced to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything is functioning better than we have, in Russia we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow are a lot of barriers, and there still is a new independent movement of a man in an electric wheelchair in the city centre.
Also there in the course of such banal things like give way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, and there already are social organizations who are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
In what, on the contrary, we constantly need to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are so many things, the level of performance which far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid is normal that people with severe disability independently moving on the streets, they can go to the toilet, to the museum, so anywhere...
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in social life, in this we them with The tap tap a little bit ahead.
Respect for the public or bezbariernost is one thing, but at the moment, when among us will be well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything really starts to change.
As this single cases - people with a strong will.
Group The tap tap currently is very popular, but back in two years ago, that in 1998, you caused her to organize?
I entered the institute Jedliczka as a tutor, around me were a lot of young people who wanted something to do.
And since I'm a musician and play the saxophone, along with colleague organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, and with time, says our leading Ladya Angelovič, it is a bit out of control (laughs).
Popularity came only in the last few years, I mixed up or something?
It is true, we helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively working on the propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can evaluate, in fact as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the European Union can we afford to qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Standing there in front of you the goal so well turn the tap tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, one another.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and lasts this long.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, sorry, it naturally...
But this completely excessive pity, because people with disabilities are not some patients and all abandoned un-ennobling, which we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only provided that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities something it turns out, this shift is not only for them but also for the whole of society.
Tvro whether the success of what you closely.44 klytcheva, how many of you believe?
If we want to do the job properly, we need to be in many things intransigent and keep a certain discipline.
But I believe that it is normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic notion and fly in the clouds, and when you know that the two times per week they should go to rehearsal, visit pre-sessionals and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But as happens in any group that wants to work and accomplish something.
Currently in the group The tap tap twenty people.
How many of them were in the beginning in 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovič.
We open a group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have a desire and will power, our doors are always open.
He will be held a day before the expected the end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague on the stadium Incheba, in Brno in club fléda and Ostrava, in the centre of plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert all three cities are joined experts at the moment of the song the band The tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."
The goal of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kronor for the purchase of multifunctional bezbariernogo equipment for Educational Centre studeo Jedliczka at the Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert is worth 400 crowns, for children under 12 years of free admission tickets can be bought in advance at bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country from the former eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the ESA 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with esa-registered in 1994 and for years took an active part in a number of projects the agency.
But the path to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II Polish enthusiasts 06-66988 flights into space, but it is not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, about the lecture and, 6 December 1933 represented in Varsovian astronomical observatory ideas from his groundbreaking work "Introduction to cosmonautics."
The idea of a young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of recalled that only Dr. Ian was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France won the prize - Robert Hesnault peltri and Andre Luiz Hersh for "Introduction to cosmonautics."
Dr. Ian (1899 – 1966), about which mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and space science.
He published in the Polish magazines hundreds of articles and wrote a number of books devoted to this scientific disciplines.
Has become a well-recognized promoter of space exploration, and his contribution was assessed including the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built körtér drezine, equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained unknown, as well as details of the project.
It is not clear, even to disperse or for braking fruck was to be used by a rocket.
Information about this drezine known only from the press of the era.
Since 1933 the Polish artillery began to wonder about missile Strel.
Study ccnewspapers.com. section weapons technology in collaboration with professors Mieczysława volfke and Gustav mokzickim.
Of the surviving material shows that studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops work were interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized print appeared the idea of photovoltaic power missiles, fighter, which suggested an engineer, and the following year came the work of "air missile - torpedo and NCSPB-25150MI rocket bomb" author lielivi - kzivoblockogo.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all projects military use rocket technology was a temporary scientific advisory committee (tymczasowy komitet doradczo - naukowy), which coordinated the job.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work ended because of the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work, devoted to space exploration, appeared in the press after the war, thanks to the work of Polish society Astronautics (Polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 issue of the magazine, which published four volumatic articles on astronawtice.
In one of them, Professor M. subotovich offered to organize society that will engage natural-technical.
At the time, already increased projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish society Astronautics (ooa) sought to join the international federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in autumn ooa became her full member.
And next year the first chairman of ooa Kazimierz zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the international federation of Astronautics.
In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956 ooa contributed a significant contribution to the development of a highly successful meteorological missiles RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, scientific study.
The first type of RM 1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
Rocket to overcome the distance of 1,800 meters, was at length about 80 cm, and her weight was less than 5 pounds.
Subsequently was built the enhanced version of rm - 1a, and in the summer of 1959 bledowsk test was conducted on a vacant lot two-stage missile rm - 2.
This rocket was in length of about 1.4 meters, and her weight was about 11.5 pounds.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to engage in this scientific work is cyclone-3 rm - 34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the high-rise wind.
But in 1962, the further development was suspended.
Heiress the first missiles of the type of RM became the Meteor missile, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 years.
The rocket was conceived as the two-stage, its total length was 510 sm., and the initial weight - kzt32,5 kg.
Has developed three type (identified as Meteor - 1a, H-1B and KV-1S), which varied by the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
Meteor missile - 1a had pythonproducts MAC-2009 0.4 VILLA-TURKISH, Meteor H-1B - 0.34 l, and Meteor KV-1S - 0, 62l.
Maximum range at all three types of was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 years in aviation institute chelyabinsk-based development Meteor missiles, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket Meteor - 2 with a weight of 380 kg was able to bring cargo weighing 10 pounds to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built versions of the Meteor - 2n and Meteor is 3.
Should also mention the accession of Poland in the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, and the creation of a national committee of the COSPAR two years later.
In addition, the programme intercosmos, Poland participated in the research space on a Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonavt after Vladimír Remek.

Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week the Constitutional Court annulled a law on public works.
The decision provoked a lively debate in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at the issues with the broader point of view.
Liberal user-focussed economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic unit, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with the untamed financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labour (salary) raises price tension.
Under this concept need to understand the condition when the manufacturer through the delivery of cheap goods is trying to withstand economic competition that is pushing the cost of a competitor to pick up a larger share of the market, and thus increase their own revenue.
On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. as a result of rising unemployment in those in countries where the cost of the labor force, compared with other high.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, including for produced them unemployment, growing the inevitable government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation raises the reluctance of gentlemen of employers pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that need no specific statistical data.
Besceremonnye methods of private capital to create the economies of individual states a situation where governments are forced to join in competition with each other, to artificially lower social level of its population, with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments Start-ClusteredMailboxServer own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
This reflected primarily in changes to existing legislation.
The goal is to force economically his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the area of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and at the same time as a tool for cutting workers' rights in the field of labor laws.
As a result of rising levels of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching one million.
In the context of increasing competitiveness of the German economy is constantly there are cases when the employed people get a salary that the state they must pay extra to receive a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people under pressure from the catastrophic fall of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on extremely low pay on the margins of society, in the hope that someday the country will come to private investment capital.
But launches, where he will undertake?
If the funds are to come from other EU countries, poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and media to nausea argue that the state may not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not management actions to intervene in the economy.
Next, you should answer the question is not whether private capital, now practically managing politics and the whole state, in their own selfish purposes?
Definite answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost almighty and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result we are hopeless situation, an emerging in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where virtually all the deserved punishment, however, is not a crime.
In Germany the situation is such that the government ministries because of a lack of financial resources to develop bills private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.
Then these bills argues the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the constitution says Western-style, but from the financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal democracy is now quickly turns out to be in such a situation, as described Appian in the artwork "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "the state has been disintegrating, and agencies are involved in violence.
Bribes, illegal obtaining favours using stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the elections with previously sold voice "..." decent people in general are not candidates for the position of governor, in the end, once the state for eight months left without consul ...."" seriously started talking about the fact that the only salvation in this awful situation is autocracy and the necessity of choosing an energetic person .." Appian thought that this will be of Pompey, but they became a Caesar, who finally replaced autocracy to democracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without regard for the public interest.
Private capital is already in its essence is not intended for use in public purposes.
Cur9incumbents result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline of elite without any efforts to reform a deeper character.
It causes of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless liberalization of economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of a liberal democracy can be perceived as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.
First of all tragic is that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophe that we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and the new history.
Repeal of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least, not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both on international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
Thus this trend is systemic in nature.
The decision are targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity part of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Violence does not work, and can never leave ” – sting, the fragile, where the main verse the refrain are the words:" don't forget what we are fragile. "
"If my sons didn't want wars, they would not have" moribund gutel, wife Meer Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has caused lots of responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position that he has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the Israeli state, genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who in these periodically recurring waves of killings is criminal, and who the victim, after all, today ' s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and not be seeing the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, to take a look at who primarily serve still-lasting already 95 years of stress (from signing the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is based on historical facts, some of them were on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the story of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great and Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people are completely independently take your steps, or for them to the throne was someone who has guided their actions to advance the goals.
We must admit that we live in a period when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and out of them, the authorities could not happen for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically wealthy families is one that could be seen as the head of an octopus (not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
Not write about them a lot.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s, the 19th century, to stop rumours linking their name with criminal actions in high places, in the shade of which they were, and who always led to strengthen their power, augmenting wealth or both, and to another.
They are big stakes in nearly all the central banks of the world, and against countries, whose central banks they do not have their shares, they lead or pre-fabricate war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi was only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the central bank of their country into their own hands.
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for Bank of America, during the civil war he began to produce your own (understand) - government money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to produce their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963, deputy Luiz makfadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for global power in the period from 1859 by 1871 year led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created great Mason 33rd level Al solderings.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially the UK, and a third should lead to a reduction of the world ' s population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (so many slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be other than as a prerequisite for this project) and final seizure of absolute power.
Method by which working group of the richest families headed by the rothschilds is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent soltuions (Order AB Chao - order out of chaos.)
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed, which was to prevent a repetition of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to untie the first world war by killing of Habsburg the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the tsarist Russia cembre Bolshevik revoluciiu.
The first world war ended a sudden, unsound in warrior and economically surrender of Germany (there was no need for the war to destroy the tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been a smashing central European powers, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the second world war the bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations than created a premise to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans strong enough denouncing perpetrators and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, with sparking the fire of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the area of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The draft declaration created a premise for mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, began to happen the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
Outbreak of the second world war, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler escaped from the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or everything that he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps have created conditions for recognition of the Jewish state the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations on 2 world war, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create nidus war the third.
If international bankers will manage to unleash, Jewish people, like in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is as if a giant laboratory, the source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also internationally (take only the sharp divide people on supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is a victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their commitment to a world power?
Here we need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers off people to vote in the election solely their own candidates.
Israel ' s current prime minister, Netanyahu, a hawk is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician that makes everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran ' s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran's control over the chokepoint, containing 20% of all of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), also lead to the destruction of the global economy.
In light of the now treatemnts words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "what we need is a general crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
The new world order in their view is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy, comfort.
A world where everyone born the body at birth implant chip, with whom he is being stored under total control.
"And makes all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slave have on his right hand or on the forehead of the stigma, so that people who are not marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy or sell.
Here's the wisdom: every person who has a mind that can calculate the number of the beast.
Because it corresponds to the name of the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty six.

The film "operation" Argo ": when worse nowhere, call Hollywood
In November 1979, the crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the US, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation not meant she couldn't afford to throw overboard Shah, because it is fundamentally could undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
But to achieve the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not able to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by the unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after talks brokered by the government of Algeria.
Their fate has caused home a wave of solidarity and antiiranskih sentiment.
Defeat in Iran have largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential elections of 1980 ended the election of Ronald Reagan.
Film, actor longer-lasting "operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history that has brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.
After some serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA in collaboration with the Canadian authorities have managed to take them from Iran, helped extravagant Lehenda cover, according to which they rode on Canadian passports as members of the film crew, in the country a place for filming science fiction epic.
Combination of genres
Plan, which invented the expert on evacuation of Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation Hollywood.
To legend was reliable, in specialist magazines wrote about the film, hold a press conference, the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long held in secret, the film, is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Film afflecu is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film - kinoopus," the story of a successful venture, scam - example could be a number of films about friends.
The film constantly changing mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from Tehran (in a caption displayed significant historical photos of events and how those same situation were demonstrated in the film - the big difference in this not).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, the overlapping with irony and moderate an exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies are men in suits discuss the situation at the tables of negotiations on the stairways institutions, on the phone...
Ben afflecu admirationful managed to make resets career.
From vismeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation" Argo "his third feature film, after dark detective" farewell, äåòêà, goodbye " (2007) and the thriller" city " (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film afflecu, who has not starred in hometown director - Boston.
A sense of the atmosphere of the place when this refers to the qualities that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.
Affleck and it manifests in Argo, where Tehran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are happening on the streets, when the reconstruction of real events, the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy is impressive its clarity, which also conveys emotions confusion and nepredvidennosti, which arise when somewhere suddenly changing story.
Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues achieved in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at a Tehran bazaar).
Far too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply many exciting scenes to the cinematic values.
He quite successfully working with this little, sometimes something dodumivaet is there all this goes not as elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America to prevent the looming crisis in the airport in Tehran, and the chase on the runway look pretty farfetched).
Lack of Argo is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are in the film are not alone.
Film afflecu lacks a little bit of drama, this is a movie that you can watch with moderate interest 1quent phílos and retro style, re-creating thrillers seventies.
But captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough for reminders about one, still in a sense of living history, and also for evidence of how exaggerated ideas about the almighty and omniscient security services.

Rules of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, conducts the annual survey of the most grotesque bank fees, now decided to declare the competition for "the most absurd ruling or project from the workshop of the EU."
"We made to this recent event, in which the EU plans to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said organizer Patrick Nager questionnaire law.
Among already put forward for nomination the absurdity is the recent decision by the European Court to unify the premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women have benefits for life insurance because insurance companies they are objectively are less prone to risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU people can nominate to the contest before the end of the year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.
The controversial orders of the EU, for example, and compulsory adding biocomponentow in fuel, as a result of the damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometer only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or directive about the size of the cages for hens, which this year significantly tightened the eggs.
Also criticized was a de facto ban on the use of the term "buterbrodnoe butter" or withdrawal from the sale of traditional light bulbs.
Qualitative bananas must be length of 14 inches.
EU-wide the device often makes a decision under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (thus Czechia now even under threat of the veto is defending claims its banks).
Interests lobby are: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the EU were to reach 14 cm in length and would not have dared to show "unusual curvature."
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the that only harmonizes existing patchwork of national rules that complicating trading.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, yet softened standards on fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that existing directive will lead to vast products.
Candidate to win in the poll may become and last year's ruling by the EU, according to which sold balloons should be warning that children under eight years may not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU turned to American research, under which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death by suffocation.
That restriction now applies to children up to the age of 14, which prohibited blow in the trade fair dudelki.
Funny ideas are born and at home
Enough is absurd and rule regarding the European officials: everyone who has the EU any official position, cannot, given the sensitive nature of the topics for Greece, to use the name of Macedonia, and should instead talk to the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
Portal bankovnípoplatky.com in collaboration with the association of liberal economists "principle of non-interference" (laissez-faire), proposed to vote, in addition to several above these absurd rules, for example, rule the EU about the amount of food reserves in the membership of the state.
The EU has set a maximum volume of food stocks, which can stay in the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the EU.
Subsequently Czechia exceeded, for example, the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she faced a big fine.
Organizers of the questionnaire also are interested in the idea of pay and some countries for the fact that they have no sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the statement about getting subsidies.
But these ideas have arisen in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage, because we have no sea.
Will ask the European Union for compensation, "said in the fall of 2004, the then minister of agriculture jaraslau Palace (CSSD).
As the argument he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called interventional procurement state had full of warehouses stocks, which had to be taken.
That the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to Palace, was supposed to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission has gone towards the Czech Republic, a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies to obtain subsidies proposed villages the ministry of regional development, the Swedish minister Pavel German (US - DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on a compilation of statements on subsidies from Brussels.
EU: bizarre orders are the exception
Although the resolution in member states can easily become the object of criticism, the efforts of the EU for regulation, as well as a more efficient operation and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
Serious problem, according to experts, is cherpanie EU subsidies on projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening European integration, but which the member states have made when discussing the budget.
Evokes emotions among the Czechs and that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and by the Austrians have retained the name "Czech curds," but "rum," whose tradition in our country goes back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename the tuzemak.
Called the rum can only products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products the EU, along with the world-famous feta cheese and gorgondzola, marcipan from a German luebeck or parma ham, has already proved, for example, in Karlovy Vary rusks, and carp and hops.
Also a trademark of the EU can be proud of carrot and gorzickie tubes.

People want me to guarded republic, but I'm an amateur, "says Okamura.
Mr. senator, as a man comes to mind running for president?
I don't think about becoming a senator or a president.
If we have in the country all functioned without problems, then I ' m not running.
But I can't watch over the past 20 years the country are as immediately scurrying around the thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then try to find a solution, as this change.
And since I have already turned forty years and I am an independent person, not flight.Children to any party, I have no other way to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.
In the Senate, you hit, but soon went to the presidential castle.
If you thus not turn back to the people that you have chosen?
I all the time said that included in the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election in the Senate.
I later clarified that if the senator will be chosen, will run for president.
My goal is not the position, the position is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
However I need the greatest influence and broad powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation have grumbling themselves in a bar or watching TV, but are ready to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
To this is added the media that person vilify, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, about me saying that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was an advisor Jiří Paroubek.
Go to your views.
The fight for the presidential castle you started with a thesis about the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the property declarations on the amount above 20 million.
To accomplish this, you need to change the law.
You have as a president such powers not, and only the whole Senate may propose laws.
Do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct tours became free enterprise, it managed to advance.
The problem is in politics "when someone comes in with a good proposal to the left or right, he deliberately repaired obstacles, which discourages citizens.
As an independent nonpartisan person I have a much greater potential to get support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party arrangement on to explain, without looking at the tenets can take each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
You think of yourself as a person, more relevant to the right or to the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer to the left.
For me it is not important at all - a little to the left or to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
It is not about what someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I always support any good for society, will offer whether his hrcm or GDP, and I just will be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says that you populist.
But do not prove whether you that what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And to this, you have to try to match.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals on which I say, already operate in the world, or about them prominent experts say.
But without the support of parliament, you will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics you do not hold on for a long time.
Or you think that when you get to people and talk to them, then you will be able to realize the criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other opportunities.
Only persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to entice them to his side, so that we have accomplished their goal.
If I was elected president, not be any problem to organise a live television broadcast, in which I draw on the heads of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in the case of failure, should be to tell why this does not want.
If there is a strong personality, which makes the abuse, it will put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was merit of public pressure.
Say directly that I'm a lover, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies, to defend their beliefs and views.
I'm only a novice in politics, and for its programme will try to get the support of the majority.
Things I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, six years to finish and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as though Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no not the savior.
I know that one I did not do, so I went around a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Radimov yanchure, he refused in connection with a large amount of work.
I also at least supported leading an investigation into the journalist Jan lorencovu, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil.
I put forward his candidacy, because people are really dissatisfied with, but now I feel like the balance.
Sixty percent of people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to choose representatives of the establishment.
Us independent in the Senate only two.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for your views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of their own party?
I haven't thought about it, because I have no time to check the purity of the past of each potential champion-a, and I have no money on this.
No money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kronor.
You have no money?
You talk about property declarations, and how your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth approximately $25 million, flat at $10 million, another apartment on 8 million art collection of around 10 million, Aston Martin to 3.5 million and Skoda superb per million, and even a few million on the account.
By the way - Aston Martin I have appeared, because it was my dream – I always liked Bond, who traveled by car, was gallant with women and at the same time have fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You travel to Aston – martin, own property on 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the country, but especially in this to invest their own money do not want to.
It is not very convincing.
I have 15 million on the campaign.
I have to get into debt?
I invested in a campaign already 2.5 million.
The fact that I have no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I am not obliged to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
Spending on campaign I essentially cover senator salary.
But on the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay the son of the English school, worth 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to just make money, so they would not be running.
Means, then you will be doing business, so that we may live?
Do you not saying that simple-cut this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, their activities I partially reduced.
For example, managing director of travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like that I was bessrebrennik, which will store the republic.
But I also need to live.
How much, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive monthly?
From 200 to 400 thousand that receive and further.
And if I become president, his business would be finished.

Architects MVRDV argue that the real adventures are not only in the imagination – for example and his recently constructed book mountains - 2 photos
"To me it seems like fun, it looks futuristichno, finally we have again, you can see something interesting," says Lisette, a passerby on the edge of the road.
But Stefan Spermon, a specialist in IT at the nearby a large company, said: "no, this building really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why us today, another library?
All have the internet, the iPad and electronic books.
Now no one voluntarily not attend such old-fashioned library, right?
, Maloprimechatelnu sleeping town under Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people, has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate fact a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the overall education and build seven fictional bridges that are depicted on the euro notes, in the form of a painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to beat the statistics: build a library here!
Blame the Meuse from Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of bold ordered diagrams and author of the witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual combination of calmness and appeared to be listening in 2003 with five books under her arm and a smirk on his face.
And while members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, impertinent Meuse folded from his original gift pyramid diamec and completed it in defense of his project with the following words: "dear citizens!"
Here's my proposal: "book mountain" in, the so-called bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, mail and several adjacent houses and townhouses in total of 50 flats.
In early November, "the book" was marked by a second prize contest "the best library niderlands 2012."
The project also involved in the national Dutch 27.06.2009 wooden structures, 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not suggest anything but postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely Premostratensians, white facades which suggest the milk, became richer on one contemporary work of architecture.
But the most important thing - in appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The long road to book
First impression: book el-dorado under the cage for the cheese.
Here only one elevator, Babycrabs in the center of the mountain massif, because these fans of architecture and reading will choose to explore the area on foot.
Osteklennoe from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, floors of bricks and elegant street lamps errorfree create a sense of public the town square.
City environment re-established ideal.
View unwittingly looking for the bench, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves stand along facades, and in the middle is a dark room, usually a comfortless and impersonal," says blame the Meuse.
We set a classic configuration space upside down and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space book mountains used skillfully: in downtown offices, online library, chess club, ecological center and technical areas.
Particularly delight black bookcases, which are then finishing walls, lined, cheap railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell the unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and engineers and builders are lost at guessing what the unknown material.
"We sought to work with secondary materials," explains Jop trauborst, the head of the project, representing community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a lining under roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter-wave thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
Delicate textiles serves a couple of seasons, after that he can throw away.
For library is the canvas for the first time in such volumes – was pressed in the four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of the heat and pressure of the so-called landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material to smell a little like a new car and a bit of sneakers.
At the top of the lead 105 dobropolye.
Those who overcome the path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquet ficusami and trees in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and primarily about the right humidity on literary mountain.
Costs of the new soul
"It is hard to believe, but this building, despite plenty of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of ecology," says trouborst.
For his heating and cooling of used warmth of the earth.
Although the book is under a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.
Broad farms from laminated wood, placed perpendicular glass facade, provide shade and assume most of the sunlight.
The climate in the room very pleasant.
The rest of the protection to provide fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the aforesaid skeptic from areas of IT, has already visited the new library.
Lizette also was already here.
As well as our traditional Chinese medicine Sintija Bogarde, which called bukenberg "soul, which has long lacked."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own meeting.
These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves not yet fully staffed library at the time it was the 70.000 books.
The idea worked.
Shelves zastawleni top.
"There is nothing worse than empty library," says architect't blame the Meuse.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation now every resident in some way associated with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which on the professional jargon called the creation of identity.
Wrote his literary history.
And if they are very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for building identity.

Clogs: "the Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow the diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: in the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the Palestinians ' bid to get observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why? "
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Now Germany need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that the American position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence – while not speaking too critical toward Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained on the no-go zone for flights.
As a result, NATO has conducted this proposal.
Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is so.
The fact of the matter is that she is in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely passes from policy, which, so to speak, led by the US, to actually German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is aggravated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent Edinaya policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but these people are not used to this.
I believe that as long as they only track their role, but are on the path to more "normal" foreign policy.
Such foreign policy, which conducts France or Britain.
What specifically means normal foreign policy from the German point of view?
This willingness to borrow in its national interest position unaffected by the position of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Economic interests of Germany largely differ from the interests of the other large states, and so Germany must protect their interests.
Influenced whether these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and to vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the states of the Persian Gulf.
However it must be very careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
But I would not give it too much importance, it is not completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Germany really harmed its relations with the US, refraining when making important decisions, such as a vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the US dominates understanding of the German position.
However I do not think that this was the same dramatic nadl, as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany even ganhará thus a certain respect.
It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena, and that with its interests should be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The US, by contrast, clearly favours a veto.
If there are differences of opinion between the US and many European states?
The power of American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in conjunction with the local political situation the government, of course, cannot openly hold such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion is not as significant, as always seems to be.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama didn't love the policies of Netanyahu.
Germany is it easy to combine their close ties with Israel and the US on one side and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes this a difficult situation for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there were a single, a consistent European policy, but now it's not.
However they could not act in the broader approach and instead forced to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That is how they come with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take on a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany it is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel.
This theme has always been fine.
But I think the Germans it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees himself in the role of an important international player is not whether she would take on a really major role?
Or a leading role still struggled Germany?
Germany has not yet got used to this, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far always struggled to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis – each time Germany assume an important role, treatemnts various antigermanskie feelings.
The Germans are not just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view of Germany is in a much more precarious position than the US.
It must take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, US influence in European politics continuously weakens, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is?
The Germans simply have to play a more significant role.
Even if you don't like that, unpleasant or reinforces the enmity to you – this is life!

"The protection of trademarks in China: when the Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what the Armani Polo?
This is officially registered in China, the name, which has nothing to do with firms, from the names of which it formed.
Nevertheless it will be protected until the owners of the original names not put an action.
But even then it is unclear whether they assert their rights.
"Foreigners all the harder it becomes to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas pattloh, lawyer company Taylor Wessing specializing in violations of the rights to the trademark in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears on a new case of this kind.
Imitatoram enough add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci LM-hash Lu - Gucci, Prada, instead you can register a Prada - Kny.
These same way legally copied the German companies, such as sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloh opens the folder with records desectionments registration of trademarks in Beijing.
14 September 2010 the Chinese company has registered there trademark Zegna DF puma, artificial name, which also used the name of fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions on copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is well known.
In big cities have manystoreyed department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, no such case pattloha. on behalf of its clients he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from desectionments trademark registration right to use the name, which is already protected by somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban," Mark is the passenger.
The word associated with "ban dakuan."
So call the women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
"It damages the business, with the need to fight," convinced pattloh.
"Brand while, a unique position is lost, the image suffered tremendously."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas are millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the market research company, notes clsa, China with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
But achieving the removal of questionable entries in the register trademarks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloh tells about the cases in which the court dismissed claims, because after a long time the opposed name became "a reality in the market."
If a complainant is lucky, he will have to pay even plagiatoru, as the damaged his trade sign in China, says pattloh.
Sometimes is ruled by the law of the jungle.
There is also the famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009 the company Daimler lost the legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer SANY, enterprise, which shortly before the firm acquired a concrete pump maker Putzmeister.
However, the Chinese still have the right to use a logo similar to star Mercedes.
Geely bought Volvo company initially used a blue and white logo, "BMW; process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashionable goods maker Lacoste lost simulator in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, which have the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.
Thority trademark registration ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 because of a lack of personnel and equipment premises there had been difficulties.
But last year was "return from an emergency situation in workflow to normal."
So, the number of unprocessed affairs on abjections decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed almost 57.000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production in office.
Fight with this is expensive
Very often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million complaints about the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record and means that China in the tenth consecutive time headed the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the department.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, just 5.5 million units.
In 2011 it paid $1.8 billion yuan collectings.
If 14gbps, this means that each registration costs an average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Appeal against her is worth many times more, as shown in the case of a German family businesses shut since Thursday.
For more than seven years, the group is fighting against Chinese plagiarist.
Germans managed to achieve what the illegal production of them fake auto parts has been defeated.
But the simulator secured a Chinese rights to the trademark shut since Thursday.
It was its own omission as a surname in Germany are not subject to the protection, says Broadcasting ventcler, chairman of the board shut since Thursday Chemical specialities in Munich.
Thority and registration of trademarks ctmo munhencev rejected the claim.
However, in both these instances shut since Thursday won, but the other party continues to struggle so far.
Need to be on
The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.
Ventcler hopes to bring the case before a good completion and praise the professionalism of the plane.
But he also said: "the process is extremely expensive and robs us a lot of time, money and the nerves."
Internal costs unlikely to succumb to the accounting, the archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago shut since Thursday vain suggested loathly side of the "great six-digit amount in euros" for the settlement.
"This makes it clear how expensive it is to us," says ventcler.
The danger of the Far East threatened to infect even in Europe.
Namely if simulators register there for an unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name shut since Thursday for footwear and leather goods.
The group has long stopped production in these areas, but despite this unable to prevent the registration.
"You need to be vigilant," says ventcler.
He and the lawyer pattloh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "all that is in any way is worth defending, register also in China," says ventcler.
Otherwise it can do much more expensive than the registration.
Really: if shut since Thursday to lose in the last act of his drama about a commercial sign, should pay loathly side of licensing fees for its own name, explains ventcler.
Otherwise we are excluded from the market in the controversial segment.

World AIDS Day: pritoptivat, sing, to help
A very happy time here in heidelberg choir rehearsing Imbongi - but in Swaziland AIDS orphans in this.
The history of relations who overcome the distance more 8733 kilometers.
First a stomping: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' pumps and male your slippers pick up rhythm on hardwood the floor and quickly find him.
Times, two or three or four.
Only after that slowly rising voices of singers alto, bass, tenor and soprano they occur, enchant and follow each other.
And Philo Hopf, a 29 year-old conductor, almost stumbled from their materchatih shoes, when leads them flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of medical psychology very happy time here in heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearsing a new song.
The rehearsal came fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from specialist in human genetics to the porter.
The "om" obani "is no easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to a whole is prima facie alien to the language: zulussk, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to the assessment of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS, in the world there are about 34 million people living with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland live 245 000 AIDS orphans.
The more than 40 percent of the population is HIV positive.
For 180 aids orphans in the village of asitzeni mantra-meditation Voices For Africa found the chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend school, prepare to further training.
15 or 20 euros per month, you can take on a patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in Go center.
Imbongi on zulussk language means a narrator or voshvalitel.
In this room does not speak fluently at Bantu, but know how to sing.
Nearly ten years the choir are song on this strange soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers summer from HeidelbergCement, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of asitzeni, which depends on the votes of German choir.
Forty percent of infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus ich.
In asitzeni in miniature reflecteth disease all Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which reduces the risk of infection dokazanno half, among the population almost not accepted.
More than 40 percent of the population of Swaziland are the human immunodeficiency virus, the death in the middle of the fourth of the dozen is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants imbogni saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education a person in a poor country is generally no chance.
At first it was a private commitment of individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later a chorus founded the association "Voices For Africa," which has since almost professionally cares about AIDS orphans in asitzeni.
The facts about infections, sexually transmitted
The most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea tripper ().
Frequent viral STDs are HIV, the human spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease - virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pediculez and scabies refer to labour STIs.
What are the main porazaemie group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sex between men.
Among heterosexual adults common sexually transmitted diseases is, are infection, trihomoniaz, candidiasis (the fungus), gonorrhea and human spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease - virus.
The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults we have relatively low – but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among youth infections occur much more often than among other groups.
European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people also often meets human spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease - the virus.
As changing the number of cases of infection?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases, are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections since 2007.
In 2011, there were nearly 2,700 cases.
Is about a tenth lower than in the previous year.
Any symptoms point to a sexually transmitted disease?
With infectious diseases can cause sores in the genital area, complaints during urination, selection, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, and the bubbles or seal.
But often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but does not provide 100% protection.
Partly because the projection of sexually transmitted diseases that can be spread by contact infection and in close physical contact.
However experts recommend regular inspection, especially for frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis can cure most of STIs and avoid far-flung consequences.
Patronage, donations and not least of all royalties for choir performances throughout Germany allow something to collect.
"Only we sent in asitzeni already about 200,000 euros," says Annie Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany manage codva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She also cares for the orphans were well organized, for example in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, both called on zulussk old women, it is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to himself to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their head and take care of children in the form of each day in time to appear on the lessons.
Those who have not left home, go to the shelter to, a lonely woman, who receive a salary from the association, as well as two cook who every day are preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association "Voices For Africa" organized a sewing school, built two henhouse and jointly with the American organisation for the protection of the health of the PSI organized apr-04 analysis for HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about a disease that is so evident throughout the country, prefer deep silence.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annie Lennartz, "because he is associated with sexuality."
Quite unusually for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King msvati III, is known for its love of largesse.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, on such unauthorized state lifestyle also lays the blame for the fact that the virus ich so quickly spread in recent years.
But she is also on a stray workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms have literally on every corner, says Annie Lennartz, "but they almost do not use.
Another culture - the flesh to flesh. "
Slightly to support cultural exchange, the choir ibmogni every two to three years, making a trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, morale, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the dark continent know since the days of apartheid.
The bus, full of white people who sing songs on the black language – such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that happened, provoked tears in the eyes of the toughest border guards.
A trip always leads also in asitzeni, where singers vipositiond sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the valley of the river aculveni she more than known.
"Go in asitzeni, there the light," say the people here.
And after 8733 264-km-long flight back to HeidelbergCement, when singers return to hall on the street, you can see that the light burns also here.

LivePerson: NASA opens the ice at mercury
Messenger probe found evidence that the planet Mercury is the ice.
The thickness of the ice sheet may have up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although she is closest to the sun, there also have frozen water, according to three studies, published Thursday in the journal Science.
Messenger probe found evidence that constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
It should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water is happening with a comet or asteroid collision with mercury.
Nobody connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, the scientific head of the probe said Sean Solomon.
The temperature at mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
But these discoveries could help explain how the water and other building elements of life are in other places in the solar system.
Imperceptibly for residents of land probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send to the Earth image: small windows in the endless gave.
The image comes from the camera, which developed the German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, and the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun beyond neptune, Ceres, on a new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a planet.
This fragment infrared Spitzer telescope image is "family portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, difficult to identify in a star circle of pink newborn stars.
This region zvezdoobrazovania scientists neromantichno called his w5 - opened Spitzer telescope in the constellation C.-D.Flade, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
The iridescent Library-Fund dying star photographed NASA's Spitzer telescope.
Like a doughnut ring consists of material which star threw them in the process of dying.
In a giant nebula trifid, remote on 5,400 light-years from Earth, from the gas and dust are the new stars.
NASA's Spitzer telescope made this photo of the galactic maternity hall.
Starry sustas pleiad, also called the "seven sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope colors are better.
As the red eye winks observer nebul snail in this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
The similarity with the continent has brought this nebula the nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides emphatic reproduction.
This new star in the whole beauty managed to photograph only with the help of the Spitzer telescope infrared sensors.
Saturn and its rings: as they have is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps this fragments of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most accurate images of the telescope hubble: Galaxy maelstrom
Depending on the color images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by European South observatory photo shows a remote for a few thousand light-years nebul trifid in the constellation of Sagittarius horoscope.
Trifid the name comes from the Latin word trifidus (,), as the dark streaks of dust is divided into three parts of an heart of the cradle of the stars.
Problem of astronomers photographed harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth's core Imofossen two galaxies rush towards each other and will inevitably face.
This is the birth of stars telescope hubble removed in the spiral galaxy m83.
Those who do not like the technical cuts, may call it the "southern cevochnoe the wheel."
Photography space telescope hubble shows a fragment of the nebula in the constellation of Iris cefeya.
Nebul, remote on 1,400 light-years, is composed of particles of dust, the size of which from ten to a hundred times less than the usual household dust.
This image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, the remote on 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed for NASA space telescope hubble.
Large spiral galaxy, scientists called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the most spectacular group of new stars of our Milky Way.
Stellar Stekšys continually creates new stars.
The starry cloud, united with Nebula socket, are also constantly creating new stars at a distance of 5,000 light years from earth.
In this brightly illuminated the galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe mostly 1870-2004 hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: major telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608, Hans Lippershey - even before Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors optical telescopes became more accessible - and their view of space all the deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope, the observatory Hal palomar under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the US, the "big telescope."
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Telescopio Canarias" has a giant inner workings - diameter of only a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
Mirror "the big South African telescope" in South Africa segmented – for the sake of reducing the cost.
Nevertheless in diameter it reaches roughly eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive constructive performance: telescope tightly fastened by a vertical angle, it limits his mobility.
Telescope "Hobby-Japan Eberl" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His special feature: high ability.
She reaches - despite the relatively small diameter mirror is the world's largest telescopes.
With radio telescopes in aresibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to terrestrial signals in space.
Radiotelescop has a diameter of the 305 meters.
Participating in the project "the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), anybody with a computer can help, by giving its processing power.
Views of the astronomical observatory service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here it is worth "a very large telescope" is entirely appropriate to its name.
His four mirrors allow cover in eye-foot chimney even average infrared spectrum.
In the Chilean observatory ESO also plans to install the European "very large telescope."
Its main mirror should raskinut by as much as 42 meters and will be made up of almost 1,000 mirrors elements.
But the photos should expect no earlier than 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescope in hawaiian Maung Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They installed two mirrors diameter of ten metres.
Keck telescopes are part of the observatory Maung - Kea, which along with them looking into the sky and with the help of telescopes and Subarus irttf.
In addition, on Maung - Kea should have new giant telescope with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here they can admire the illustrations.
But the most important species from space delivers space telescope hubble.
On April 24, 1990, he delivers pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler searches for planets outside the solar system - the first such, on which possible life.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that i.e. 1,235 candidate planets have been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photos show the latest cooking space telescope Kepler.
James Webb space telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the rocket "Al-Arian 5."
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he must in the light of the first stars and galaxies look for a big explosion.
The scientists suggest that Mercury is ice on the south pole.
But reliable data about this is not, as the city moves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements for decades, pointed out that the mercury is ice.
Thanks to running in 2004 probe Messenger is the first, which revolves around Mercury, scientists now believe.

In southern Azerbaijan many residents are biblically respectable age.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
The search in a country where 97 years old appear to be still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called the wild and romantic.
Minibus with the rumbling of rolls on the winding road past overgrown with dense forests hills, turbulent rivers and ordinary peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright that you might think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But it is the most southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few miles away.
Here live talishs is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which we know little, except that they were speaking in Farsi and 08-65243 and longevity.
The final paragraph is lerice.
A small town flaunts too ponderous architecture Soviet times, which is not attuned to the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost didn't come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too tiresome.
In 323 kmІ takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
Legendary wealth, which the country is obliged to oil from the Caspian Sea, here, in a province until it got.
But pilata fatulaeva (48) is convinced that in lerice have something of interest for tourists.
"In May, Baku has become famous festival song contest - and next year we will be a festival of the oldest people in the world," says fatulaeva.
She is director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here documented biography about eight dozen Talyshs of these places, which is more than 100 years fatulaeva points to black and white photography.
This is my grandfather, he here 120 years.
In the age of 136 years he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is a sheep herder Shirley muslumov, which allegedly was 168 years.
Birth certificates, however, is not.
And given that the man, whose age is confirmed by documents turned 122 years, age muslumova seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains fatulaeva.
The man was married three times, and he was 23 of the child, aged 136 years he allegedly daughter was born.
So added to a sheep herder muslumov a couple of dozen years to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about dolgozitelyah in Central Asia.
"Amazingly many people old age can be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "in Sardinia also lives are a lot of very old people."
However, because of a lack of documents the scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no registry civil status.
Each day a glass of baked oil
Nevertheless there is the fact that people in the district of lerice strikingly often reach biblical age.
Now here are 20 people older than 100 years.
Why here, in the south, so many centenarians?
Azerbaijani guide Farid mugimzade explains this specific genes Talyshs.
Fatulaeva director of the museum, by contrast, believes that the case in nutrition.
Talishs love meat, bread and more dairy products, many of them drinking on glass baked oil every day, but it is unlikely that such calorie diet can be healthier with dietetic point of view.
Or the case in primitive way of life, which keeps people youth? in chengemirane, a tiny village near the town of lerice, lives rubaba Mirzoev.
In 97 years, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
:, Which argues that she has 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which tirelessly skate back and forth.
Here under one roof live eight people, including one of her sons and daughter:, who have long been already have their grandchildren.
Also nearby skip the two children.
Guests in the kitchen preparing tea, which is served in a typical pot-bellied glasses armudu.

I always have my hair milk, so that they will never slip and saved the color.
"And I never enjoyed shampoo," says: the.
Monthly pensions have enough for life
She always ate only that grew in their own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I never bought the products in the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the army.
Heavier it was after the second world war.
But it was better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often sounds in a speech of the old woman.
But the cult, created around figures of the father of the nation, who rules the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then took the reins to his son Ilham.
Yet among the elderly there is no poverty.

The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
Revolution was back in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show a deep rift in the country.
Future constitution, based on sharia, met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president also had pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And its success lies on my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was turned to all people, but primarily to Christian coptam, liberals, the enlightened Muslims and irreligious Egyptians.
Because they are all still hopelessly fragmented in distraught opposition, are in fear.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence, "to save the revolution."
But that actually wants to save the 61 year-old engineer with a doctorate in American University of Southern California, not quite clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Whether cs-2009-6074.e power of the judiciary?
In fact, the 234 articles managed to smuggle into NOCHNOY 15 30-hours-long jump with obstacles on islamistski configured constitutional assembly from 100 participants, and it partly suspicious.
As in previous constitution, the draft states that the judiciary relies on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does it mean to the principles?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and one might fear that Islamists will use blurred the formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for more strict interpretation of sharia law.
At least on this suggests one of the newest article: in all matters pertaining to sharia law, should attract for the council of university Al Achard, an Islamist most important institution in the country who has great authority in Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy regulates the legislation that de facto would be the consequence of the limitation of the judiciary.
In the draft of the constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: should preserve jurisdiction of civilians a military court.
These courts in the period authorities Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of a dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family ” and“ maintain its morals and values. "
Legally it is formulated so loosely that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of the film and literature.
Open the text of this means nothing as censorship.
Generally no article does not set right the equality of men and women.
But another prohibits to insult and denigrate the Prophet Mohammed and his envoys.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording that prohibited "insulting people."
Is it enough to be a caricature of the president or jokes about al-Rayyes?
The question of interpretation, like much in this project, which Morsi has a signature and who, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
Already several weeks is formed the opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document even before he can enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we will win," said Hamdin sabbakhi, which took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy agency Mohammed El Baradei said that the draft constitution place "on the scrapheap of history."
Through the service short news Twitter he accused supporters of Morsi a desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and dumping him," said butya-capital yasser has also said.
"We are not tired, the blood of our brothers still not," cited the Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they do not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Well-organized Brotherhood, in turn, called for the demonstration, but, from precautionary, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and Salafi supporters who shouted: "the people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded that Morsi: "ochisti country!" and assured: "the Koran is our constitution."
The power struggle over the symbolic square, where it all began, provoked a state of almost civil war.
Followers of Morsi, quite obviously, didn't want to go to this risk.
Brotherhood announced that, as opponents and supporters of the draft constitution 611835 loud and clear.
Now it is time to give the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
Most for the Islamists, it is considered been a done deal.
The concept of human rights "not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Sayeda in fury from this accelerated the constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February, with the participation of all social forces.
48, a human rights barrister and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (eopr) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when under Mubarak they sat in prison or be brought to justice.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights for him, indivisible.
For this he was beaten, jailed, was arrested.
And now the words "human rights" never meet in a new constitution, regrets he's in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi ' s expanding influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints lawyer.
These measures represent an overt attacks on the democratic rules of the game and lead Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthen civil state, president of de facto annulled his," regrets of Sayeda.
Because without civil society organizations democracy cannot function.
Sayeda feels that all left it, even the international community, which looks at the ideological battle lines on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
For this can be granted.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: "you create a monster, which will not be able to control."

The Norwegian rakfisk: the bad smelling of fish in the world?
Pyatimillionnogo population of Norway has one of the highest levels of life not just in Europe, but worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of success in this country is somehow connected with local addiction to one extremely smouldering the fish dish?
A few pieces of cheese.
Place them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You have a sense of smell the odor rakfisk, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around snow-covered scenic views. it is a very beautiful, but in air pour the tangy smell.
Rakfisk is the trout, posipannaya salt and cities in the water up to a year, depending on what exactly nice man need to achieve.
As the gathering twilight and temperatures drop, Norwegian crowds gather at the festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this the most, shall we say, the fascinating dish.
"Her eating a raw and with a glass of aquavit, local vodka," explains Havard halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and "general," which runs the festival.
Everywhere around us people eat chopped small cubes fish and with its massive amounts of alcohol.
"Someone more like S.A. than rakfisk," says Havard.
This drink is able to interrupt the smell.
I try on a couple of pieces.
If we can take a piece of the nose, it's not so bad – differs little from portions-surfaces sushi, which you long extendable-wire with him on the bus.
Rakfisk is the product of an entirely different times, time poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish autumn zamachivali therefore closed barrels with salt water.
Then deep in the winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly zabrodila, it removed and, perception of alcohol, eat.
Even the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegian were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the US.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% of immigrants, which are lured here jobs, higher wages and a well-developed social welfare system.
Residents of Sweden (longtime rival, and yet not so long ago and far more wealthy neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat smouldering element of past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the news around the world, and most of the inhabitants of the country it seems.
People here still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist and racist, last year, killing 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, called the attack "happened on 22 July."
Norvezcam very hard to believe that in their peaceful country of one of their citizens was capable of such atrocities and killing.
At the heart of today ' s well-being of Norway is growth (since the early seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, trays with elegant rakfisk, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of nordic well-being.
We the people – as you call it - level-headed.
Like most of the Norwegian, she is fluent in English.
We do not like doing the show, we are not boasting.
Norway very carefully drawn with its oil and most of its revenues, the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years prior to the global financial crisis, when all Sori money, which they had no, Norway thrifty counting all costs.
"As long as you can ski in winter and to go hiking in the summer, this is enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there are rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for any food - rakfisk with me enough.
Here's a burger with the elk meat is certainly exotica, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we'll have more of the same fish with unforgettable smell.
In my hotel hold a special dinner www.organiccoupons.org rakfisk, during which visitors ballot determine the best or, perhaps, the most aromatic fish.
Goes direct reality, in which show the lead in a bow tie, surrounded by highfrequences with rakfisk.
It is like the Eurovision song contest.
"So, top Jurgen, which estimate you have set for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, here is our assessment...."
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falling from her chair, perhaps, usurped akvavit.
Or maybe just the smell of the fish.

The president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto will be a tough early career.
While the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto is due to join the post, a correspondent for the BBC, will grant invites us to look at the difficulties, with whom he would meet, and the mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Traffic in Mexico City now in a particularly woeful.
This city is overloaded transport and in the best time, and on Monday were erected steel barricades, several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
But this was done not in order to not give people get to work from the suburbs, and to thwart protesters get to the Houses of Parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto sets presidential the shoulder belt and take the reins of the country.
Before him is not an easy task.
Mexico has made good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, which now pulls his authority, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed about 60,000 lives.
"My government says the people of Mexico about their readiness to fight violence," said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to suggest a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements next to the US president the political career of Mr. Peña Nieto has developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state, the country's capital, opinions are divided about the new leader.
Direct man of
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, about it fondly remembered.
Residents put him credit for the revival of tourism, development of the resort industry and infrastructure.
Until you can reach the city to one of the new highway, built by Mr. Peña Nieto, who are very different from the roads with potholes and Yam, who were previously on this place.
A placard with his name are hanging on a modern building a sports centre and on an impressive interactive museum devoted to climate change.
"We associate with him hope of real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally of Gabriele Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman cyprianite Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed our country, primarily in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI was Emeljanova in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12 years of absence in the presidential palace, western party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes accusations emptiness, who put forward the new president of the opposition.
He was very straightforward and very loyal to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
A great statesman, and, above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people will have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality, also known under the name of Ciudad business processes, is the most startling contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under overpass highways, he in many ways is a suburb in the Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality, too, are dour character of this metropolis.
Earlier this year for pacification gangs that sell drugs in these areas were involved in the troops; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
On a vacant lot near the vast landfill only in the last two years was discovered several dozen bodies of the murdered women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during s Mr. Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar figure in sad played violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name when it comes to killing innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto, about him in the best case, you can say that during his tenure as governor, he was not able to cope with the problem of killings of women.
In the worst case, his administration accused in complete disregard for this problem.
Resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this obsolete quarter.Nearby irenei Buendia barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his late daughter Mariana the moon.
According to the official version of Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
But her family believes that she killed her inmate.
"When I got to her house, it seemed that her body before this washed," recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body already ocochenelo.
Mother Mariana retell this story, and a portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to a crucifixion, which with just one word: fairness.
It is in this, they said, was denied this family.
"State officials appealed to me as with the old guest role on gossip girl, discontented of calm.
They want people to just took on faith all, what they say, and shut up.
But this is wrong, so you can't, especially when there are so many irregularities and weaknesses, "she said.
By presidential the shoulder belt on Saturday, the president of Peña Nieto with her take on major responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected the crimes associated with violence, and the new president promised to make this issue a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same president, what was the governor," says Olvera, congressman from the Valle de Bravo from PRI party.
But this is what is most fear the families of the victims in Ciudad of business.

Bradley manning not complained about mistreatment, said the prosecution.
Prosecutors are trying to refute claims Bradley Manning about the poor conditions of detention.
During the hearings great attention was paid to stay Manning in military prison in kvantico, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of detention Manning were brutal.
The US Army private accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
On Friday the prosecution attempted to prove that Kondeh Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leaks of classified material in the history of the United States, are not taken advantage of numerous opportunities to file a complaint of mistreatment, which, he says, he has had to move, while in military custody.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort foreign ministry, Maryland, a military prosecutor, Maj. fein said that record weekly visits Manning administration officials in prison for nine months of his detention in kvantico, virginia, contain no complaints of mistreatment.
Cross-examination under the claim of protecting Manning to dismiss the case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and by themselves have been sufficient punishment, was held on the next day after manning said that custody, he intended to commit suicide.
Military expert in the analysis of intelligence, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the website WikiLeaks.
Resource WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was manning.
During the hearing on Friday, prosecutor fein together with Manning looked at reports that filled after visitings manning administration officials during his stay in prison kvantico, where he was under a strict regime of imprisonment from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison employees Manning asked the questions and recorded his answers.
When prosecutor fein asked on Friday about reports, manning acknowledged that evaluates appeal to himself from the administration of the prison as an excellent, and general terms as "very professionally organized."
The reports do not contain complaints of abuse, despite what Manning directly asked about the conditions of his detention, said improved.
Manning replied that he expressed concern about whether these problems and that visiting his administration officials discussed with him these problems and have stated that they will, but not documented this in writing.
"They recorded" no problems "after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the subject in a conversation," says manning.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he never complained about his ill-treatment with him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission, suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing a few months before that.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve that he was acquitted of the regime "prevention of injury" and softened conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited detention regime is at a level lower than the regime of oversight to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the detainee, and also for the safety of others.
"I wanted to know the administration that with me all right, so that they have cancelled the prevention of injury... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," explained manning.
On thursday manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at the naval base in kvantico, virginia, in July 2010.
He said that thinking about suicide appeared to have him in Kuwait, and that once he lost consciousness because of the intense heat.
He explained that psychologically very hard when you don't give to know, how do you solve your fate, and that is happening in the outside world.
"My world shriveled to base Camp arifzan, to the size of my prison," said manning on Thursday.
"I thought that I'll die in that cage."
In kvantico, manning, he said, spent much of the time in a small cell - at least 21 an hour, and often even more than 23 hours a day – in solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and sunglasses.
He says that he tried to move, because sleep or even simply lie in the daytime ban rules.
According to Manning, during sleep in his eyes he consistently beat the light coming from the outside camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he perevorachival in bed at night, then, in his words, his budili and forced to roll over on his back.
Lawyer Manning filed a formal objection to unfair manning in January 2011.
In April 2011 Manning transferred to a military prison in the fort livenvort, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday the judge questioned Manning about the statement, which he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in kvantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates on the morning test.
Manning said that had not been able to hide behind a blanket during the investigation.
Answering questions from judges on Friday, manning said that he understood from the security guard that must throw blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one does not directly ordered him to throw it.
On thursday manning, said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempts to show the officer that he is not a danger to himself.
Manning, said told the officer that could use the gum cowards or slippers to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, according to the testimony of Manning, his underwear, slippers and sunglasses were taken away from the camera.
His lawyers hope the judge, at least, will take heed of what he had suffered while in detention, and substantially reduce the sentence, if convicted, will be manning a military court, which must begin consideration of his case at the beginning of next year.
The defense said that plans to offer Manning admit blame for less serious crimes, and others dispute the charges as excessive.
Resumption of hearings scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were acquitted.
The Pentagon argues that manning held in kvantico in accordance with rules governing the content of those arrested with the most stringent regime.
Among the charges brought Manning, are aiding the enemy, the illegal promotion of the publication of data on the internet, the transfer of information relating to the national defense, and the abduction of state ownership or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of indictment, he could face life imprisonment.

My crisis of national self-determination is the story of American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize their potential.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they resemble residents of the country about the difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans American-born torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City I walked along the corridor for arriving, approached the border control and remained in place.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for the extranjeros (foreigners).
A few seconds I stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life called the mexican.
It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston called themselves Irishman, and friends from New York consider themselves the Italians.
Later I stopped on a complex structure "American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than those of native speakers, and I can't get rid of an American accent.
Because I pulled his American passport and was in turn for the extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual for meeting of the presidents of those countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto liskut talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, which Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to remain in Mexico, instead moved to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a North American trading bloc, like the European Union.
In addition, the president of Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not mention.
For Mexico ' s relations with the United States - heavy and full of old grievances question.
Most Americans never thought about that in 1848 the United States invaded in Mexico and at the barrel of a rifle forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But Mexicans think Premyslids, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in all.
However it is worth only any statesman US obmolvit though word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite Mexican society away complaints about what Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyaut militancy.
In this most complex are relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the US.
You want to talk about the insults?
Them enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, the people who are in this country for yourself opportunities, and those for whom such opportunities not.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver and San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point their family history anyone is the father or grandfather - had no opportunity to implement themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of those were Mexicans a certain type of "dark complexion, untrained, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about it.
In Mexico it see otherwise.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and boarded the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is an American, not the Mexican.
Our national self-determination confuse and it is not clear, but we know what the country considered her.
The United States of America.
Besides, we know that most of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
We respond to them the same.
They see us reminder of humiliating defeats and refer to us as a second-class status, as inauthentic Mexicans.
We are not good enough say in Spanish, and our ties with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence for them due to failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We were not would now for silk curtain, finding in the US satiated life, but having lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the US even in childhood, and it reminds me that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin there are certain friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican descent is a real shame.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my acquaintances Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
And in the US we called the Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship is not sufficiently intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans to Mexican origin worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented its interests in the US.
We could tell their friends - Americans about what this beautiful country and how great her visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing out.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, the binge of corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not believe that the country is a beautiful.
Sorry, but figure it out with this themselves, amigos.
And this is true.
If part of the Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States the way they interact with Mexico a century and a half ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent still in London for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes it.
Perhaps, we have more in common than it seemed to me.

Old battle in the new Middle East
The cease fire agreement between Israel and Hamas ' s can be a fragile foundation for further peace
Possible a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
Sound, traditional, pointless debate about who first began; many buildings ruined; killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released with the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the capital of Israel, Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly entangled in his the eternal the conflict in the Middle East came to change.
To this can be interpreted in many ways, but the events of the "Arab Spring" spin in rebellious storm many well-established realities, with the Israelis and Palestinians have not been able to stay aloof from the vortex, shaken the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than previously.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without the winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if a ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be executed that occurred this week clashes only strengthened the hand of the security forces on both sides.
Leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in Gaza in 2007, say from that they forced Israel to back down, despite the incurred losses.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas has intensified its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by currently more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time works for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and wealthy friends.
Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, has acted with the support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the wealthiest and fastest growing states of the Persian Gulf.
Two, the victorious Hamas supporters claim about creating around Israel Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, in which the militant group Hezbollah, Syria, in which all the more proislamistskie insurgents is about to overthrow the rule of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king is threatened by Hamas ' s allies.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred in the southern border of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where President Mohamed Morsi strengthened the influence of movement the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was deposed in 2011, was a secular dictator, not special attention to support Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, are the organization largely Pjorn with Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic normsi Hamas can be a significant player, whose voice could not drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, the hardliners in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israeli missile system "iron dome" justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of derelicted Hamas rockets.
Citizens of Israel can sleep, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the US remained committed to their unchanged positions; many European countries also laid blame for the start of the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, approximately 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the territory of Gaza, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part through the walls, which comes to the territory of the West Bank is a significant part of the unacknowledged Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such action from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud Party is in preparation for the January 22 election is reunited with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very efficient.
What meaning pander to the Palestinians and to give them their own state?
If they give in their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run out of missiles at Israel, as do their brethren in Gaza?
Better keep them behind the wall and harshly suppress any attempts to raise his head.
Perhaps, the hardliners prevail; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab spring.
Though Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the warm feelings towards Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.
Defense part of the budget's more than in all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on the cease-fire, is a good sign and it may mark the beginning of change.
Israel, not least, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.
As the democratic change in Arab countries, the deprivation of the Palestinians ' right to self-determination is a time bomb, which sooner or later going to explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, like a bus, exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population is only compounding these problems.
The bloody operations, which are held every few years on the territory of Gaza to crush Hamas, must pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need in the external momentum
It remains the only solution, to which relentlessly call sensible representatives from both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education two states and territories Israel concessions in exchange for security.
Hope, not too impressive in the short term, is the hope that the cease-fire will allow other countries more influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is past time to make a decision to cut off the supply of arms to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make the effort to reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming vote at the UN, the result of which can become a virtual recognition of Palestinian statehood.
Its role is to engage Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term he never presented its own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still shows the unwillingness to connect to solving this problem.
Is a disastrously hopelessly myopic position.
The United States is interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

"It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of the packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya plibersec, citing research that performed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest percentage of smokers in the world, so that these changes are not especially affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of those measures are already considering and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of black market, which will be sold cheap and available cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for the British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will deliver much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import-module Pty Ltd, argues that demand for cigar case and silicone cases, hides unpleasant pictures on the packaging, rapidly grew up (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco and Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in the high court in Australia, where he tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra ha, company Zico already implemented around six thousand products wholesale businesses and expects a new party.
For us this is a good business.
Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among this is the part of the population, at these measures.
After the Australia series of laws that makes illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sports events, as well as prohibiting retailers to sell cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet.
The Australian government banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the network, but it cannot restrict in this foreign sites.
"If you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their goods on the internet you find very attractive," explains Becki freeman phenomena, questions of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in such social networking sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether this is a matter of the hands of the average citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare time and effort and made the video, or is behind this advertising company?
Australian branch of the company's British American Tobacco argues that in the industry now more busy adapting to the new rules, rather than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states have claims in the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries is insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by the middle of 2013.
According to Tani plibersec, the government has discussed with the other countries the possibility of making them similar laws on packaging.
In 2001, Canada first introduced mandatory placement of photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia, ostentatiously not obey innovation.
These pictures of me not graze.
I just don't pay attention.
"Simply drawing cigarette and hide pack in his pocket," explains Victor El Hague, who buys cigarettes with a photograph of a tumor of the mouth of the pack.
Frankly, the only thing that could make me quit - this is my little daughter.
James annual, Head of store tobacco King Of The Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same packaging complicated task of installing the goods on the shelves
"Before I have on unloading a new party went an hour, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and to ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it's over, close shop," he says, vskidivaya hands up.

Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
In this day of thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because of our aircraft were mechanical problems and it replaced the other plane, which we and awaiting.
Thus, I have had enough time for reflection about the nature of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Half a day at the airport in anticipation of flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines, neither the iPhone nor even duty-free shops.
But recently, more and more scientists and experts in child development are lobbying in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored not so bad.
It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that probably contributes to creativity.
And because in the modern world we all are constantly before any screen, the benefits of boredom walk past us.
Maybe we need to strive to boredom?
Yes. "
And at the same time, not.
We will come back to that.
Before I, like many others, believed that boredom is the invention of the relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not so, argues Peter thuyas, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary and the author of "fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"Actually boredom can boast a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
This remains an open question about how we understand the tedium.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often changed.
Having studied the materials research on this topic and program-of question target group in 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but cannot do so, that would give them the satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that man is not doing something that would like to do.
The apathy do anything I don't want to.
Main in experienced boredom, he says, it is a "violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in sentiment and a sense that time is stretched slowly."
The description of boredom can seem very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, but people experiencing depression, see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes it seems to us that we get bored, when in fact we just hard on something to focus on.
In his study "unoccupied intelligence-a definition of boredom from the point of view of the attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives On psychological science, Professor Eastwood with colleagues refer to the earlier experiment, participants who listened to a recording of the voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises not relevant programming included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds at a low volume, so their barely could understand, and the third group listened to only record the voices without any sound track.
Those participants who heard TV with low volume, and noted that they were bored, often others found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this, and attributed it boredom.
When we try to focus attention on a difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the university gvielpha, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting kind, "for example, studying the flow of products in the pipeline in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom."
It is considered, he continues, that when people start pokatchivat on a chair or paint scribble on a piece of paper, they do this from boredom, but we now know that in fact such actions simply help not relax physically.
"The study showed that children who do not prohibit fidget and gardener learn better and remember more information than children from which require sit tight," says Professor Fenske.
In some moments we all feel the tedium: when delay in flight (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech presurvey uninteresting kind of film.
But different people have different levels of propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s for measuring such individual features the researchers have developed a special "scale propensity to boredom."
To determine the valuation on such a scale are questions and assertions, for example, "a lot of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved" or "me too much fun, so anything that is not enough time."
With the help of such questionnaires the researchers found that boys often bored girls, "says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when there are a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers in general often bored.
In 1991 Reed Larsson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he is contacted by pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents to eight times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said that they get bored in school and during the execution of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.
While only 3% of parents said that they get bored.
Professor larson notes that it has no data about how would such data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "on adolescence have the propensity to boredom, ” mainly because children and adolescents do not allow to fully solve than they do.
Go back to my original question: boredom useful?
Sometimes no, because in extreme manifestations it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or betrayal of certain substances in an effort to relieve boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich dedicated study this problem more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something different; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
But this same brain is not always knows what to do better.
If you'll be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
But if you watch TV, you will be better only for a while, and soon it will take place.
However, if your child is missing and you give him the iPad, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to fight boredom alone or as otherwise manage your time and employment, "said Professor Fenske.
"But such skills of independent regulation of the art in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child learns to not only to occupy himself something, he also learns to control at all.
I don't think that boredom need to somehow praise.
But considered her something bad, too, is not worth it.
Rather, we should learn to feel comfortable even outside of the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agree with this.
"We see it is that we need more experience boredom, with the boredom is extremely unpleasant, the unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he said.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.
"In the modern world we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when the silence, we are at a loss when not know what to do."

It is unclear how it will apply a new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, mouthwatering player football team and a student of public college in the southeast of the state of Colorado accused of committing criminal offences that will soon be completely lawfully throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Lamar and rode in the car on the prairies of near the border with Kansas, when they stopped by police.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco came .Communication in court for possession of drugs and possession of the device for drug use, petty offences, for each of which have their fine in the amount of $100 - and the appointed date of the hearing.
"With us are treated as criminals," says Mr. Orozco.
Criminal--that but does he?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of cannabis in small amounts for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small litigation depends not so much from the law, how many from consideration.
Accusations of minor offences associated with marijuana, already charged in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which passed a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charges to people 21 years of age and older for storage of small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks the law comes into force.
However, in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors decided to examine the existing cases associated with marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of the drug.
At the same time in some cities from denver suburbs to the mountains of the West vote for something to prevent the emergence of in their places new, licensed state stores to sell marijuana.
"All of this is growing so fast that I don't even know what to expect next," said Daniel J. oates, police chief in the town of Aurora in the east from denver.
Representatives from the regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also ozadatcheno pochesivaut head.
They will form the rules for determining the order of licensing of growing, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, is it good or bad, ahead of most other states in resolving issues use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian and Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and marketing of alcohol in the state of Washington.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr Smith than put forward any proposals and hope that it would work.
"We have no real precedent, to which we could navigate," he says.
The bill the state of Washington, called the I - 502, will enter into force on 6 December and for a whole year, plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing yet, and the right of possession of marijuana has been institutionalized.
But there are in fact still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state of "adequate access to licensed marijuana with a ban on the trade of it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and day-care centers.
"It is especially difficult it will be to place the licensed to trade marijuana in cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingstone, a spokesman for the newly created by research group Centre of the legalization of marijuana. "
21 November police chief oates from Aurora sent his employees an e-mail message that the city prosecutors will no longer attract individuals age 21, accountable for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stops ulichat people in these violations "from this moment."
Police chief oates reported that the police will be enforced in the town of rules governing the activities of individuals, farmers marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug distributors.
Prosecutor weld's role as the district in northern Colorado, Ken tank, is a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill he said that prosecutors will still involve responsibility for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users of its people undergo treatment.
Currently 119 individuals charged with possession and less than two ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused and other violations.
"The duty of our institutions is prosecuted for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr tank in a statement.
Reaction was controversial even in places like rural district of Mesa, where participants vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police Grand junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracts adult responsibility for possession of a small amount of drugs.
District attorney Pete hauttsinger supported that decision, but also decided not to take accusations on already open cases related to custody of marijuana.
"I believe that enforce the law until he won't change is our direct responsibility," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the residents of the state of Colorado, which took part in the vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of issues of marijuana use for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be simple.
But contradictory reaction of residents in different places drakino denuded ambiguity relations between the local authorities of the state to experiment with marijuana.
"The county prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Shawn makalister floor lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the national organization for reform of laws on marijuana.
"They sought for so long people for this is that now can't really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states in which to a small number of marijuana are the same as to alcohol is destined to become an experimental field in the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously await instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to consider a sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Proponents of legalizing marijuana hope that the justice department to give in on this issue.
Despite several have received wide resonance of arrests of traffickers and patients who used marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases gave welcome to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and the 16 other states.
Bureau agents to combat drug is unlikely to rush into the house to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they hardly become blind eye to regulated state government shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration endorsed a moratorium on the opening of new stores to sell marijuana, and so would not have been able to open up sooner than a year.
Last week Bahrain, a town in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration by the six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which apparently will be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in this position that we will issue the license, and then this will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and those that voted for the state.
Remains still a lot of outstanding issues.

Petronella: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I'm a conservative.
Persecution of university students for their views began not today.
How much I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best in the world of educational institution, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, the two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of training on the historic Sartayev vusterscogo college at Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed up and left, which led to the first real scandal in my life.
My father did not survive and burst into tears.
Friends were get confused.
Newspaper The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college, because I didn't like it that my classmates have sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left, because I had to drink from Ščerbatihs cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I was systematically hounded and intimidated.
It's not because of my fairly unusual name or that I attended a private school.
Hounded me for only one reason, and in this glorious the cradle of the enlightenment it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a follower of conservatives.
You ask, why should remember about this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students that follows center-right views, is exposed to the same highbrow-baiting.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred of students - conservatives in Oxford is so strong that last week, a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as that which is available to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge claim that their "often actively isolate, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce to the committee on the equal rights of the college an additional representative, to ensure that freedom of expression.
Their situation only exacerbated released recently on BBC 2 documentary about politics in a student environment "land of wonders: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives introduced eccentric and neo-nazis.
In the film was shown Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, which travels in Rolls-Royce Royce, wears a silver suit and stick with silver.
In other universities students - conservatives complain that of them makes "scapegoats because of rising school fees."
Luke black, 20 years, the vice president of the association of conservatives magnetic, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in a university environment increases distortion in the direction of the left.
The people who we don't even know, believe us with impunity arrogant and unruly children of rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at Corpus Christi College, in which was filed the petition on strengthening protection, calls such an atmosphere a comfortless, and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, said that the ratio of the student club to host of center-right views worsened considerably.
"It poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, or simply to normal life of the club members," she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was the one.
I came back in September 1986, timid and shy eighteen girl.
Oxford unrepentant from hatred of the Conservative Party.
The year before the university vote deprived former a student Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of a reduction in the budget for higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even the Stalinists.
In the first days of the week freshmen, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, the first time I felt that awaited me ahead.
I still didn't know that teachers not only looked through his fingers at a hunt students - conservatives, but will gladly took part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and disagreement government apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa – penetrated through the wood panelling walls trimmed with audiences.
On my first seminar I had to translate French text of the eighteenth century in English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss," said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, please translate the first paragraph. "
The text was given me with difficulty, I hesitated.
Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face, like a cake.
"Tatcheristi fundamentally not teach French or they simply did not have enough brains?" he asked.
Other students zahihicali.
In my eyes were full of tears.
"I advise you to take a few basic lessons of the French in their free time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," probruzzal Pitt.
I returned to my room is absolutely miserable.
That evening in the college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student in the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of Conservative university.
"I know who you are," he said a friendly.
"Unfortunately, it is as follows:
Over every person suspected of sympathies conservatives, will get.
I myself not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most freshmen and conservatives pretend that they are Labour. "
Later, in the local pub, I am too cowardly to hypocritical.
I insisted that did not agree with all that, says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick failed.
First-year philosophy, politics and economics, which he studied at Eton, said: "you're the daughter of a fascist pigs.
You contagious. "
Other students 3g-hatched his words.
I was a morose, dirty.
"As conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"They beat each other, right?"
I felt like, must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of the criminal prosecution in the sixties.
If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labor and hide their true beliefs?
The upcoming me three years, began to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
His hated not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Thatcher on issues of foreign policy and one of her speechwriters.
In college, he practically not appeared.
He despised him for personal remoteness, pettiness and commitment to Marxists determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the university Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you won't be happy," he told me.
I travelled to Oxford from the parental home in London, seeking refuge with relatives and impartial nablyudately friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the cause.
He did not believe them.
During his studies in 1940 there were any political views.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said in a dismal manner.
Is there for this are not able to, only not in the city of dreaming spires.
Even my friends - the Communists always behaved impeccably. "
His wet eyes putneli.
"Not take a hasty decisions.
I am sure that this is just a joke.
You break my heart, if left university. "
I was iznurena regular trips to London and my emotional defense ultimately collapsed.
My friend, also a conservative, was unable to bear the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
The next week at the seminar, when another teacher history quite seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the soul burning from shame, I confessed that "I washed with brains parents," and called them "old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time he wrote every week on two columns for newspapers belong rupert murdoch.
My door was locked.
I could not get out, and after five minutes of my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I picked up a suitcase and sat on the first train to London.
I and not returned.
Can call me and cloth.
But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational establishment.
The sadder that this was Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers Tories, but to this day is behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino prefers the elegance of fame"
The exhibition "Valentino: master of sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Nati abaskal, fiona Thyssen - bornemica and other famous female clients Italian designer
Somerset house, the former residence of the British Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, a worthy take an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer admitted that during the opening of "Valentino: master of sewing," triumphal retrospective exhibition, which brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created his home for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character of which is "Iles signor" Garavani, but she could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated with rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, abound personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salimi Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie Chantal, the princess of Greece, and Margaret, the princess the UK.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of their social ascent: from humble tailor vogera from the city in northern Italy to Kumir the international elite.
Be lovers in the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
"They at least cushion the cigarette butts of their cigarettes on your magnificent rug, as some are doing great stars of pop music," says Baroness fiona Thyssen - bornemica.

"He never goes out of fashion, because his sketches is a real works of art," finishes it.
The parade of
Garavani life is a story not obsession, and love with full grhastha.
He loves people with a good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries Somerset house was transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty metres in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models to strut out onto the runway, contemplating the spectators from dreams that sparkle masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress, which chose Jacqueline Kennedy for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, costume, which used Monica Vitti in the night, or coat from wool and leather, which belonged to the Empress headlight Dib.
In this audience of models blestaut such names as sybil Luxembourg, Gloria von Tarnie and taxis was recognised by, with Princess Mette Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia gabsburg.
Nati abaskal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - like first love, "it is impossible to forget."

Proportions are ideal.

I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear it on holiday in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with ruffles, bustier in the crease and a strapless neckline.
"It was a dream that has come true," says widow Rodrigo Mostera "arenberga.
"Valentino indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless," explains this Italian aristocratca, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires - Aires.
Princess Mostera "arenberga keeps its festive dresses from the designer with the" utmost care... because the dress is not just dress, it is also a collection of memories that has accompanied it. "
Fashion the king
The great final exhibition at Somerset House - wedding dress Marie Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 girls (as the designer calls its sewers) to make this outfit from an ivory silk with incrustation pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and the biggest in four and a half feet.
According to journalist Heather john Menkes, the greatest authority specialized press, the dress represents a milestone high fashion the end of the 20th century, "the return of customers from the top of the world."

There are people for whom their job is hell, while others literally work in hell.
Among them are Anto Widjaja, one of 400 miners who earn a living prey - Ijen cavah sulphur into the volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Everyday Anto comes down to the very bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the earth, congeals on contact with air.
Otcolov huge chunks of sulphur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, will place a basket on the shoulders and carries them upstairs to a precipitous rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, the height of which $947 meters, just 250 metres, but Matt the required more than 40 minutes to climb at a snail's pace, with difficulty keeping his balance and carefully the road to not ostupit and not fall over the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost him his life, as happened to one visitor from France, which started a few years ago with gravine cavah - ijene.
Miners with cavah - ijene earn 5 euro cent for every kilogram of sulphur, which mined
Once at the top, they pave a road between the tourists that their photograph, as if they were monkeys from the circus, and wearily carrying heavy baskets, stride three kilometers to the scales that mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is about PT-group candy ngrimbi, company, which operates from 1960, the volcano, and better and not to say, of its employees, which it pays 21,220,774 Indonesian rupiah (euro) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells over 10,000 rupees ($83) of euro petrochemical industries, because this mineral common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
"As the norm is perenoska 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each hodcu," explains to us Anto, which usually performs three daily carry.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end, feels broken, but they allow it to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although this seems next to nothing for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"Day riga-skirotava miners very high by local standards, where for collecting coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and average monthly salary is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," explains the, who earlier was a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in banuvangi, a town near the volcano, for the good reason that in Indonesia is as overwhelming as serrats: "I married a girl from Bali, where some hindus, and brought her on Jawa, she had converted to Islam."
ANTO have asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases
In his 27 years Anto spent three years, risking a cavah - ijene, serrats which has already started to affect on it despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughs continuously, and he (him) ñëåçÿòñÿ eyes because of toxic gases, which allocates a volcano.
This is the price that he must pay for achieving their dreams.
"Work for another two years, because I would like to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises a more than acceptable English.
If life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or porter at the hotel, but instead he performs work anyway.
Dividing dirty wooden hut with other one, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because serrats not ceased to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow turns into a blue and glitters in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating way a small lantern, connects to his helmet, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters drag basket with gray on his shoulders from the bottom of a volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company will not mechanized production of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment baggers who work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they do not receive even parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) charge for shooting, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge with tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people - mules.
"This work for cattle, not for the people," says badrusin, stocky one of 42 years, who spent on cavah - ijene three decades, since he left college.
Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he assures that will endure the job "as much as you can, ” because he needs money for the education of their three children aged 18 to 10 years.
Not go to retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although serrats burning throat and eye burns when the wind suddenly changing and catches the miners in dense pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about their serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in his knees and ulcers on his shoulders that become deformed under the weight of baskets.
Balancing a basket on his back, now only can raise 50 kilogram in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades get 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three truck carrying on a warehouse in tamansari, overcoming the distance in 18 kilometers along a narrow path after.
"Don't go to retire, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says, opening his mouth, which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years, also runs carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty kokoshniki from generation to generation of one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what do the human mules with cavah - ijene.

Singapore is looking for children to save economy
Singaporeans accuse career, stress and housing prices and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore need to grow."
I'm the husband patriot, you're my wife patriotka, will honor our civic duty and create a life!
It might seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising mints loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of this - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local saying such as "let's suppose Bao (Bulku) in sight" to laugh at birth rates in Singapore.
Advertising agency, which has made this video, BBH's, enshrines the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to the issue in the entertainment form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that wanted to use the power of music to people Yuzharlanneft "their national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We reproduce the worst in the world by a similar, so we felt that this is the theme that we must address.
We knew that the government tried to do much, for example, carry out the launch of spirits with pheromones or arrange zergling dating (blitz-session visits).
Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely compose rap?
1.2 the child
Who does not take it so lightly, so this is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies for the enthusiasm of citizens to the birth of a greater number of children.
The state package for couples and parents, provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extend maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state is a city in south-east Asia, also known for conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to his national management of the population, is currently at level 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the percentage of substitution – in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang weia min, director of policy for couples and families of the national population, says that the reason the "improved education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"It's allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and creating a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms, help increase the number of bachelor and postponement of marriage and the birth of her children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to a sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causes resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites, where flourishes barely concealed xenophobia in respect of many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which is criticized for keeping wages low and reluctance to integrate.
The growth of immigration also is seen as one reason that last year Singapore's ruling party has received the worst result in the elections since independence.
After the elections was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility has known the impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to not built so much a small housing.
For example, it is beginning to influence the real estate sector.
Guidance on urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box," which you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments area of 46 square meters very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote idle lifestyle and deprive incentive for developers who want to build a big family housing.
But Lim Bezdolny sun, general director of the firm's been El developers, says that their "boxes of shoes" sold much faster than the more spacious Czorsztynski.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give a more clear guidelines for developers, who earlier put tape, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Much too perenapryazennye
Singapore is a city and the state.
Although these new rules can be a step in the direction of an increase in the national birth rate, after speaking with singapurcami who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very overcommitted, housing expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people it is a delay," says a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Men and women cite his career, stress and housing prices and education as reasons that make it hard for kids.
So, how would the government nor to encourage its citizens to birth children, in terms of the chances, the final word rests with singapurcami.

Personal offline - personal online
The privacy.
According to the dictionary the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about private property or "sphere of personal life, which have a right to defend itself from any interference."
That is a personal for a minor under 16 years?
How he uses this definition in their daily lives and on social networks?
Does he understand the danger of being when discussing online situations, which certainly not shared outside of the Internet?
Elperiódico took ntervyu five guys from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they are associated with the term "something very my," in a private plane, and "password and username" when applied it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets I would not load in the post," says Jorge a decade, when trying to explain the importance of personal on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"This is a very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he argues.
On FB I load beautiful images or pictures from the games.
Also, I play with their friends.
"I would not have shared a photo that is not my, or someone who behaves stupidly," he says.
Boy realizes that bad publish obscene photographs of naked people, crime or write abusive or violent comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends, who in his FB, and its nine folloverov on Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
Mother in the know, it does have the password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter, to express themselves and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know, do me, I only their load," he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk with distant relatives or with their friends in a rapid," he says.
Without thinking, replies that never would have accepted a request from an unknown person.
Wouldn't be with someone who might have recommended the stranger.
The case of a 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager is open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter recognises that't know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one to him not vtiral in confidence and not asked his home address or phone number.
"If I become pressure or require, simply remove them from their account," he admits.
Jose has become a follower of Ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to experience what today is known as kibermobbing.
One familiar my girlfriend blackmailing in the social network.
He threatened, and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures us.
The victim, according to Jose, not deleted the account.
"Only included confidentiality."
Then he explains a sequence of steps for setting up an account in a safe way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would have uploaded photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confuznikh situations.
Yes, I would have done this, if people don't like me or if I like it.
"Although I know that this kibermobbing," he confirms.
The key questions
Marielos Porras, our English and a specialist in the education and training, believes that to direct children and teenagers need to understand that the goal of social networks is to inform.
"The internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Porras indicates that Turpion Mark prenski, master of pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the labor digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital natives that they, children and young people who were born in an age of technology.
"We the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.
Explains that this topic is difficult, "because we have them ask to have a certain criterion what you can or can't distribute, publish or speak, at the age when adulthood.and not enough for this."
"Also they were selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to specialist, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, "ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them that they didn't do this, is useless," she adds.
Then Porras lists some of the options: there are things that you would have told a stranger, so why should you do it online?
Or, you would have liked, if published a photo you like those published you about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you sign party photos, did you ask permission from other people to celebrate them?
And another, all whether you need to know, what are you doing in each moment?
Another item is to give them to understand that they must behave online, just as they do offline.
Rules one and the same.
"Beyond the internet a man behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, the same must be in social networks," she said.
The vigilance
Astuardo guardia CUEF lecturor, professor of primary education and consultant on education, explains the need for family heads christ.12 read the policy of social networks.
Understanding each of the items, they have good reasons to talk with children about the preconditions for the opening of the account online.
"For example, the age and what is permitted to distribute or publish," he says.
According to the Guardia, the key question is to remind children a lesson "don't talk to strangers."

VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without public limsku the declaration, announced previously and theoretically signed binding family members.
Efe repeatedly attempted to get access to the document, signed by the sixth regular meeting of heads of state and government of the Unasur, but sources from the office and the administration of the president pointed to the main page that his surrender after closing, but then confirmed that at some point he will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
To questions about the text, they indicated that the content had described Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, during the brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was all the time is limited.
During the day only translirovano was in the hall for the press, the video without sound presidential assembly with the message "closed session, the sound is prohibited."
A little information that cleanly among reporters, was transferred to the press secretaries of some governments Unasur, attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian.
The only document, common during the day, was a list of participating presidents, which caused resentment of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, which asked for more information.
Subsequently, the president of Peru, sent an email to the media with "the final declaration of the summit, but it is about Humala ' s statement, and not on the official document, which ended the summit.
Last October, the Peru took the third summit of South American and Arab countries (Aska), and in that time, despite the fact that this insistently demanded the press, too, was not extended the so-called limsku declaration, which was previously announced.
On the official website Aska you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international meetings Peruvian authorities have tried to were provided with transmission system for all journalists, but most have limited information.

"We will respect and fulfill the decision, which clarifies the disagreements that we currently present in this international court," said Humala, alongside his chilean colleague.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals," added Pinera, and welcomed his hands Humala against the background of the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents that they obey the ICJ, happened just after the Colombia protested this week pact, under which she admitted submission verdict this international court after the decision on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which she considered wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, membership of which the Unasur was suspended in 2011 after his impeachment of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening a discussion in the morning and for closing the summit, a little after noon on limsku time.
The head of the state have read the final document, which reported that were adopted by 16 agreements and were approved by the direction of action on 31 project among South American countries, the amount of the alleged investment of $17 billion.
Among the accepted agreements he mentioned that the countries of Unasur 2.b.b "important steps toward the goal di-vorce citizenship, for which we are expanding agreement about the place of residence."
He said that being taken action to improve "cooperation in the fight against the insecurity of the citizens and against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, low-cost access to the internet in every corner of South America and taking into account the aggregate and effective way of the risks of natural disasters."
Because Europe is in crisis, "economic unification (Latin America) should not have a break-up of the basics, and should serve to expand our production base and anticipate a better future for our cities," added Humala.
"We decided to give the privileges of a group of 31 iconic projects that will improve communication -spaces South America, especially in rural and frontier areas... by combining our country and forming new economic schemes," said Peruvian president in reading the message.
Among the projects he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and limited transversly-rotated axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two are focused on great relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document has affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its new accession to the Union of South American Nations," from which she currently excluded.
Need to Latin America remained the region's well-being and peace, would be united, and had good relations between the neighbors, was another theme, at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to conduct negotiations in good form on the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international court, the Bogotá.

"South America should learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship: Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the aim, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), being held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "were killing each other during the second world war" and in other clashes, "but now they're practically one otechestvo.
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing di-vorce citizenship, who approve of the Unasur.
"We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is happening with members of the Andean Community, but still there is a reactionary sector who want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president showed himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact San Jose about human rights.
Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, south americans, on the contrary, the sign all.
"Inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and is financed by the United States," he said, alluding to political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that does not regret that decision, because with him he had betrayed his principles, and comply with its "deepest values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in his time "there were some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be observed process."
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged crimes of sexual violence, while "the Swedish law considers possible to do it via video conference, which could make from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa has confirmed that there is a risk of deteriorating physical and mental health of Assange.
"I haven't spoken with him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador, I reported that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said Ecuadorian head of state.
What really have is a danger of worsening of his physical and mental health because of confined in a small space without opportunities to do exercises on the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum to Assange from June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities and stressed that there were negotiations in London about finding solutions to the problems confined the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don't negotiate about human rights, it is a word we in this case do not use, but there were constant debate.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because the lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garzon, leads a number of processes in different European authorities," mentioned it.
And said that "if the United Kingdom tomorrow give a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and how it has done in other cases, by senor Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or by him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa seized the opportunity to show itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and stressed that he would not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of freedom of the press is not tainted by villains - policy and bad journalists, supporting profits, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained satisfied that none of these journalists, "neither the bankers nor capitalist countries - hegemonic power not dominate in Ecuador," and added that, being reelected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also upheld the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and supporting coups in the guise of legality, ” because in reality "it has eroded the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president found, moreover, "entirely justified" to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos ' s lead is now negotiating with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not enforced.
Is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflict is inevitable, but they must be overcome with the desire to go together.
You need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good completion of a dispute about sea borders, which lead to the same court in Peru and Chile, and said that "the right thing for Latin America go to international courts if the two countries agree to take a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
About the opportunity to stand as a candidate for the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite hard."
Correa assured that if it loses the election in February of 2013, will depart from public life.
Personally I've never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed only by the political power.
"My political movement that, that I guarantee this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
In the event of a victory that would be my last term in office of the president, and then we got out of public life.
If you lose, the same.
"This decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone for treatment, which had already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which finished with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality, and security.

Mortality from AIDS today is the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21, when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"It stunned me," he recalls the difficult, despite all the tact of a doctor, moment.
The boy hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to learn more about it as much as possible.... and his efforts frustrated - he has already said his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest patients HIV fendou hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (hc.gamer), where he appeared in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was already 22 years in the early 90s it would be hard to believe - too little then existed treatment options, too little was known about the disease, too biased treated patients.
So, even the director of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those times have AIDS was the sentence.
It is now possible to survive with this syndrome and to do this, not worsening quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about his illness, so far, many people come, when the virus is already damaged, drained their immune system, and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first notified cases, "a great achievement for the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the total population in exactly the same," said the head of the HIV fendou hc.gamer, Jaime andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information confirmed in April this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the extent of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, with the best life expectancy of those who did not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4, and up to 50 years, when it is reported about 500 CD4.
Simply put, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live without the problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, we should remember that life expectancy of Mexicans today at an average of 76 years.
Although mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, fell from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report from UNAIDS), it's also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Us only in 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May this year; however, argues that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
"Why still have the deaths?
"Personally I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I imagine this myself, so the things in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don't know about his cabir.i condition, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He led the crushing data: "nine out of ten patients come, when already have some opportunistic infection; that we need to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who asked for it."
In his proposal to agree experts and officials of the state council for preventing AIDS in us (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who turned to check into a private lab, motivated only by the fact that it made him a friend and, despite his young age, he was already in a phase of AIDS and even suffered sarcoma Kaposi, cancerous tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that will die, and don't want to know.

Hector hetin Reyes: "basketball was my life"
The avid basketball traveler Hector hetin Reyes was more than 60 years is associated with this sport and, thanks to him, have been all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector hetin Reyes.
And before a brain haemorrhage becoming him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player of the smaller categories, a player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and the head of BSN with cowboy bayamonu and president of basketball federation.
"I did a lot of roles in basketball, throughout his life, including several at the same time, like when I was president BSN, director general of the national team and the president of the federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to his home in the Primera Hora bayamonu, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this statement.
The walls of his home, almost all with photographs and memorable things, collected for his long way, show about it.
Heart bayamonu in
With big emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the cowboys, since the mid 1950s as a player until 1982, when the age of 15 years, his performance in the role of an agent or agent contract.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships cowboys since 1967, as an agent, with the agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to the one in 1981, the year the debut jerome Minsi in BSN.
From the moment and will continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, which was a great administrator, "said Reyes.
I remember that gin Bartov, who went here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, rising 6 '7."
"You want to?"
And it was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players, who were from Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended that sniper Raymond Gausse-Kruger, who received citizenship and became one of our best scorers.
I remember that said that if Minsi brought the championship bayamonu, gauss would have helped win another.
Chempionstv cowboys with gauss I admired, but already at a distance, because to 1988, already was the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and accomplishments Minsi in the national team.
Remember how we won for the first time the US during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup 1990, in which we have got fourth place and this was to be a bronze, if not the Canadian judge, which made us beat the final game, "said Reyes.
The team with the World Cup in 1990, is the best team, what you've ever seen?
She is among the best, like the one that won the Dream Team in the Olympics of 2004.
But my favorite was the one that plays pan-americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the national team the US, which was quite similar to the one that we have won bronze at the world championships.
In the team not only again played Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and piculina (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) Tonito colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Quixote Morales, who could not participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury.
The team, which perhaps was not the best in terms of personnel, but has brought us a gold medal and a greater joy, was a team of Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995, a protester, Argentina.
Role players like Canito nievesa, Pablo Alice and young Rolando hurruitnera vzamin players, temporarily estranged for the mess in Inter-American Chempianat Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, this was piculina Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has not dominated at this level, as did piculina.
And that is without taking into account his career in various leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best puertoricancem movements-in?
This is a very complicated question.
We had a very good young men, including Julio Toro, Flora Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, armandito Torres.
From young, I really like the work Leo arilly.
What do you think your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was to 17 teams in the season.
What you need to do?
Were things that I wanted to achieve, for example, the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now guys travel and play too much, and it's unnecessarily.
At least, I see the fruits of compulsory certification and appreciation for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
Now what are you doing?
I mostly listen to music, watch music videos on YouTube of my era, enjoy their grandchildren and occasionally go on basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been with me.

The course, which explores "the end of the world"
Every week, students explore the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when religion professor Stuart sharm decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that had irresistible lure: the end of the "long countdown" the Maya calendar, 21 December, for which many people jumped as for proof that heralded the end of the world.
But fashion had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call dolgoarmageddon, and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian theorists end times believe that the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said fashion this week, students at Rutgers university - Camden (New Jersey).
If you analyze what is happening in the world at present, as if we have just 30 days, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically the latest in history.
In templsk University associate professor Barry vacer reads the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas eventually apply," he said, and the way in which a hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.
If nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, could hit the war.
This month, students analyzed films on the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell students that, possibly, probably, plausible and impossible," said vacer.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read the course, which is simply called “the end of the world."
"We are not adding '2012', to always be able to read the course once again, in case the end of the world will not come," said Restall.
Despite the "imminent destruction, ” students should learn, to prepare projects and take final exams.
In Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that leaves students with no choice but to work "to the same night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.
Courses have proved quite popular.
"Places ended in two hours," said Restall about its course for students with the highest average scores, which recorded 35 students.
We received e-mail for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked, is there still space.
The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch that humans do, to console themselves," said Brigid Robinson, a 23 year-old student separation of religion and sociology from haddonfilda, New Jersey, in Rutgers - Camden.
And an apocalyptic image of thoughts, secular or religious, it's just a matter of comfort or his absence.
Will vecesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I never heard about the course, which would be taught this," he said.
Me he likes.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor is not said that he believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project touched prophecy of Maya, and in some ways we his discredited," said Julie zeglen, 21 year-old student the last course in templsk University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there are apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which has several centuries, where people react to the changes around them, predicted the end of the world.
The internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
In cleam the world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question about whether he knew about some informed about "the end of the world."
"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the disposal of the appeal court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noticed that for a long time the many days of the last of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "people immediately begin to think about the next date" or the philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said that they are going to go to parties "the end of the world."
"Maybe call someone from friends to get together, laugh," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old connection.
