The Republican strategy of resistance of Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies to combat spin in the elections.
But the native believe the myth, arguing that the cases of electoral fraud in the United States more rare than deaths from a lightning strike.
By the same token Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States over the last ten years.
One thing you can say with certainty: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
Therefore most state governments since 2009 adopt laws, усложняющие voting or the registration process.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new locations in 26 states.
As a result only one 2011 was taken by 180 bills limiting the right to vote in 41 state.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, упраздняют voter registration on the day of voting rights and are eligible to vote for citizens who have a prior conviction.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state does not oblige voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state, which imposed a similar requirement.
The US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law passed in Indiana in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice and in other states.
Over the past two years they have bills, forcing voters to present a photo ID, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID, such as health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of the American people, that is, the 21 million people under age, do not have identity cards, needed to vote with the government agency issued a photograph of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds $100.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 15 percent, 25 percent African American men, зарабатывающих from 18 to 29 years of less than $35,000, 18 percent of the population over the age of 65 and 20 percent of voters do not have the required ID photo.
But that's not all.
The students - voters, who are supposed to vote for candidates from the Democrats, in several states are not allowed to use a photo ID, issued their educational institution.
But these same states allow members of hunting and fishing clubs who vote for Republicans used mainly for voting certificates issued by these clubs.
Until 2004 no staff demanded proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Beginning in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures, obviously, aim to limit voting Hispanics.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Hispanic voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers raised in 2011 упраздняющие registration of voters on election day, the laws in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to help those who want to register.
This restriction was not without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped make the lists nearly 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures ranging from 17% in 2009, led to a fall in the level of the registration of new voters in 2010 compared to the previous year.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have adopted laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting in five other states.
So, during the 2008 election in Florida 33 percent of voters, exit ahead of schedule, were --, although recent accounted for only 13 percent of the total number of voters across the state.
The same thing happened with people from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24 percent of citizens who voted early.
Unlike the whites, forming 76% of voters, among vote ahead of schedule was only 46 percent.
Of course, lawmakers, Democrats and their supporters vigorously oppose the adoption of laws limiting voter registration drives.
Several draft laws were ветировано governors Democrats.
The most ambiguous laws was suspended for intervention by the attorney general of the United States.
This has partly to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of 34 states have adopted laws, requiring a photo ID.
Nevertheless, the new rules, joined in the action, of course, will implement the voting rights in the 2012 elections.
The criticism from Democrats condemn bias laws, which were adopted, seeing in them a clear direction in order to influence the 2012 election results in key states.
The center's report native from 2011 shows that states that these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential election of 2012.
Only one thing is: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit the system of American democracy.

Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, a PSA test gives sometimes erroneous results, лженегативные, sometimes and лжепозитивные that cause бесполезному medical intervention.
The men, and so reluctantly undergoing clinical examination, is from which hesitate even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked two experts opinion.
The research, conducted in the United States, experienced numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the findings are difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any specific recommendations.
Another study, this time the European, found a different level of mortality in those patients who underwent screening, and those who don't walk him.
The study also showed that, after a 12-year-old observation, the likelihood of metastasis by 30-40 percent higher than those who had not passed screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting with 40 or 50 years, if one direct relatives had prostate cancer.
The men of African origin also are at an increased risk.
The key is making the right decision, as soon as the cancer detected.
The cancer can be as aggressive, as well as вялотекущим.
The patient must clarify the extent of his cancer risk of the disease, offering him options, without the mandatory treatment for prostate cancer, which poses no danger to life in the long term, while making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many men, have detected the cancer will not undergo a course of treatment for their cancers are aggressive and does not represent a threat to life.
We will offer them an active surveillance, and if we start treatment, the disease will progress.
Increasingly we with precision define the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.
But it also consult with your doctor to determine whether to pass the test or not.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, мовембер created a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is not a miracle-recipe, to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
Is that if all the people well fed and quite moving, 30% рако cases could have been prevented.
"If nobody smoked, this figure rose to at least 50 percent," said Andre meetings, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, an estimated 10 percent of the cases of cancer caused наследственностью.
Several types of cancer are totally unaccountable.
For the Canadian Association of cancer-fighting smoking remains a priority, despite a decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85 percent of the cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is doing immense harm to public health.
"Even today in Quebec has 1.5 million smokers," says spokesman Andre meetings.
The encouraging fact: ten years after refraining from smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
Weight
According to the car, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, Tolstoy and colon, esophageal, pancreatic and ovarian.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," adds to the association.
Food
The association also recommends limiting intake of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausage products also should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or засола, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"recent can damage cells and lead to the development of cancer," explain the association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists engaged in the study of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But for the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called straight.
According to the SCC, study of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, while another gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of influence on the development of cancer vitamin D also is not completely clear.
But Mr. больё stresses that their anxiety and family history information important to discuss with your doctor.
"The analysis does not lead to cancer."

Бозон Higgs in detail
Last summer a message about the fact that scientists may be able to detect the Higgs бозон, caused a fuss - and not without reason.
It is believed that this бозон explains a lot of all particles in the universe, nothing less.
In addition, he said, is the last particle whose existence was predicted in the framework of the standard model is our best, or, in any event, "the least imperfect descriptions of nature and the behavior of matter, but which have not been found experimentally.
But physics is not yet fully convinced that it is concerned about бозоне Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of doubt, that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles бозон Higgs predicted by the standard model.
In addition, the new data, presented this week at a major physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, though for the full confidence of some of the data still lacks.
Imagine all the same that talking about бозоне Higgs, as well as a chance to make a mistake seem minimal, and let's see what this means.
One law is, in this world is inevitable, said that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule, there is no way, not even try too hard, otherwise навредите itself.
But although particle physics is quite a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of nature: Pauli exclusion principle, which suggests that the two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "квантовом condition" is a "condition" is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
As a result, physicists share particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens, called фермионами, who wisely obey the principle Pauli.
On the other hand by бозоны, гнусная gang anarchists, who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle that means that they might be in the same place at the same time.
According to the Web site (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure Berkeley Lab, these бозоны are, in turn, into two groups: мезоны, about which we will not mention here, "particles and forces," through which apply the basic forces of nature and to which in some ways is бозон Higgs.
These same бозоны, it should be stressed that not all exotic creatures such as you would think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, this one by one incredibly banal бозону: фотону, or "Baath" of light, which is a "courier" electromagnetic forces.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge, accelerates or changes of direction, this "violates" electromagnetic field in this particular place, like a stone, brought in a pond.
From this "violations" born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV, etc.), and this wave is anything more than a фотоном - and, therefore, one бозонов "vectors" forces.
The more stable field
The same thing happens with бозоном Higgs, with the only difference that to this бозон appeared, should be "disrupted" the Higgs field, another field.
But the Higgs field much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to rouse him, to achieve very high energies, as if it was on a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large stone.
That's why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated in CERN's Large адронный коллайдер, a circle with a diameter of 27 km! "to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with electromagnetic field is also to explain the relationship between бозоном Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all of the materials and not all particles interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, never himself will not be kept in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all the particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact, have mass, while others (like photon, by the way) didn't have it.
So, as a "can do" all these studies, asked Ms. пламондон?
In science, they are used to validate the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts cm.
At the same time some of them passionately crave, to reappear this divergence, T. K. slightest discrepancy could open the door for a "New Physics" and plug some holes model.
The latter, you have to say, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (ouch!) or for dark matter, which produces about 80 percent of the universe (ouch-ouch!).
But while the CERN found no such differences.
Consequences
Benefit from these studies for the everyday life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it isn't.
Watch: in the early 1960s pioneers laser research at Bell Labs could not even guess what the revolution will bring their work.
They envisioned their applications in science, but not more than that.
In fact, already the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and that he has developed the first continuous laser (previous were momentum) in 1962, said that initially the laser was more like "gadget lab."
Imagine...
And, moreover, can have an application for tools, accompanying the study.
For example, the same уиллиард Boyle during their optical research in 1969 has developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as the "eye" in digital cameras everywhere in the world and deserved the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just shows, in fact, that everything can be.

Palliative care is the best way to die... | "debt"
The Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate question at the end of life.
The debate should soon resume, but at this time is the bill.
Yet in this crucial area remains to be done.
"debt" to look closer to home.
Just a few weeks ago Mr L. Still lived alone in his apartment in монтережи.
Prostate cancer, his разрушавший inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"gave me five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the orphanage in palliative care Victor гадбуа белёй, which came on the eve of the visit.
"But it's always a shock, for it is impossible to prepare," he said.
The disease is doing its job: incredible weakness, which does not allow yourself to go to the toilet, and even to eat.
Sitting at a table, on which stands аппетитный lunch, he relents and agrees that helped him take food.
He бодрится, even manages smile, talk with strangers, which employs around him, bring him drugs, do it in the bath.
Courage in front of the usual death.
"My biggest wish that cured me from diarrhea, it's humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found the drug from this malaise.
"For the life of US taught that a man must urinate standing up," said Pierre-Victor гадбуа Broder, a psychologist at the orphanage.
Regress to the status of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
"Everything depends on a person's ability to tolerate the decline, he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people engaged in palliative care, important events случаяются and in the midst of this decline.
The patients who arrive in palliative Victor гадбуа shelter, all have cancer.
Forecasts see them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called "therapeutic."
Ms. A., 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to learn of their children.
"I've got good kids," she added.
"I don't want anything else in life," she says, before allowing put her mask, developing breathing.
She is still waiting for his son's last visit in the coming days, recruited from Italy.
At the orphanage гадбуа Victor with the help of a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with food.
This is palliative care, which remains that nothing more can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 residents accounted for one seat in palliative care institutions.
This very little, given that sooner or later, we are all dead.
Life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, explains Dr. Christian an orphanage - one of the doctors.
Whether the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
Dying we accept provide ротовые wash of brandy or Pepsi, watching what he asks.
Diabetics we no longer force to control sugar levels.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer Mr. X, who died today in the middle of the night.
On the morning of his son допил this beer in the legs of the deceased.
"We are close, as well as patients," says Natalie Savar, director of nursing care.
At the orphanage Victor-гадбуа no day is similar to the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, sitting on their подушках during a toast in his honor, 36 years young man dies tragically, surrounded by his wife and two small children, parents and перепробоваший everything to survive.
"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancer patients in 45 years of age," a doctor says Christian an.
53% of patients taken in an orphanage гадбуа Victor, come out of the house, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
Is that 77 percent of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care that is provided, to alleviate the suffering of the sick, included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home or in a hospital or at the orphanage.
And some institutions, such as Victor гадбуа shelter and the Society of palliative care at home, the big Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on care for cancer patients.
Is this a big gap in the health care system of Quebec makes many doctors - palliative care specialists fear the new law, легализирующего the assistance and help with suicide.
Since October circulates the manifesto, signed by beacons in palliative care, Dr. балфуром маунтом and Dr. Bernard ляпуантом and so-called for their disagreement with this initiative.
According to Dr. Christian an, Quebec's health-care system is not effective enough, to provide high-quality palliative care on the right before the transition will be allowed to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, "I saw пациентку, who spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to ease them.
I am afraid that patients are willing to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy.
When I told my онкологу that I stop treatment, she told me that she regrets that I stop the fight, "said.
At the same time, she told herself to me that my days are numbered!
Care is not all-powerful
Dr. an believes that 90 percent of patients who ask about death, thanks to medical staff, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain.
But it should be noted, however, that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in dealing with the pain.
According to элси Monroe, director of the palliative care in the community of palliative care at home, the big Montreal patients not receptive to обезболиванию in 8 percent of cases.
In the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or permanently.
No more pretending that we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same thing: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I wish I had the assistance," meaning "I want me to become easier."
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalist grant from the Research Institute of Health Canada.

The real estate with large-scale scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of political parties and experts of the Italian mafia day by day tell what they know about the system, "colossal" опутывающей construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and the gangsters.
"The industry, which is very expensive cost taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"Curiously, the way the system after all the funds were put in it, Jacques дюшено joked, a lawmaker and former Montreal police chief."
It is due to him in 2011 scandal as a result of the investigation of crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, to which the prime minister at the time of the liberals, Jean balloon, agreed very reluctantly.
"The report дюшено" established a direct link between the industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only one of the Ministry of Transport would have retained a billion dollars in contracts," if some withheld their instincts take share.
The commission шарбонно "already сместила two mayors," he added, hoping that she could "open the scheme behind individuals."
The permanent division to fight corruption, created in 2011
The case had created a permanent division in 2011 on the fight against corruption, which entered a state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, moreover, the staff of the special unit "hammer," which after 2009 forced "cartel" сточный Montreal, stop the overstatement of the value of the contracts.
Over the last few weeks had made a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular, franc зампино and ришару маркотту - the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
On line - Gilles вайянкур, recently retired from the post of mayor лаваля, the third largest city of the province of Quebec.
His suspected неоднократном receiving bribes in the allocation of government orders.
In addition, the indictment was charged several engineers service routes of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Lino and аккурсо замбито.
The latter detonated a bomb, after the investigation of the "system" of government contracts.
Within a few years замбито gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal, a facilitator, connected with the mafia, which, in turn, his party mayor жеральда трамбле money "joint Montreal."
In the 2000-s замбито сорил money foolishly. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68 million euros) to various parties across the province, mostly liberals, who then in power.
In addition, he admitted that illegally collected funds for former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie нормандо.
Sewer contracts, in which victors cost
In Montreal "corruption" system worked well.
Gilles сюрпренан, a former engineer for civil construction, in detail described her in front of the Commission: in the ten years he had received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel for the matches in hockey, golf tournaments, in restaurants, and bribes in exchange for a sewer in a total of $736 million contracts, the cost of which he overestimated.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that received the bribe, завышая account for 30-40% using bogus additions.
Then one of the organizer of the party's mayor, Martan дюмон, accused Mr трамбле in the fact that he deliberately closed his eyes to the existence of parallel budget, наполнявшего party till dirty money.
After these revelations Mr трамбле resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Шанталь руло was one of the first MPs in Montreal, забивших alarm.
The mayor of the UNESCO-de-прэри district in the east of the island, she is opposed to the sale of municipal land since 2010, purchased for $5 million and перепроданного for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She said that during the investigation, which eventually will be launched, "she pulls the plug, to understand the functioning of the system, кишащую ants, to stop гангрену and to identify the guilty."
This process she характерезует as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will need its own investigation of the group and the Observer, to avoid the return of questionable practices.
As we убираемся at home.
On a regular basis.
Jacques дюшено notices for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially his worry about the role of the "elected officials knew about the scheme, but is not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money to finance the re-election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he joked: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 parties, but, he said, it will not change the situation: "Until we strictly limit elective spending, in politics are dirty money."
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of government contracts and party funding: "We cannot fall below; boldly in other words the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with better control and legality."
If this story and casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. дюшено urges those laughs, look in their own backyard.

"псж - not FC Barcelona!"
This season you in псж achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual conscience, but can - and the new measurement псж.
Profit great players.
Beside them I расту every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during a match, it's easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I don't распаляюсь.
From the very beginning in the center of the provisional training in клерфонтене ниф and prior to my arrival in Saint Etienne I always strode forward.
Thus, you take the benefits of competition, by Carlo Ancelotti.
Renewing this summer is not a novelty play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training session is very important.
As a result, that a player like me, wants to be at the same level as well as best as possible.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti assists in my position.
Substitutes such as Claude макелеле, who played in the same position as I help him.
Ancelotti is the master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspire respect the technical staff.
Today, he has no equal in the league and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won a lot of titles with high clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles in Paris.
In January I had with him was обнадеживающая conversation.
Then I went from a series of injuries.
The trust, which he supports me, also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season псж?
In the first league leader Lyon took place in us.
But we are still at the ready.
The Champions League is one of our main goals: we spectacularly qualify in one-eighth finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We'll go as fast as possible.
Now everyone can be.
We can say their word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of the Porto, in order to be able to accept the return match in one in eight of the final.
Whether псж become excellent European club in the short term?
He has already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris to win titles and consolidate positions in the long run.
Today it is not.
Financially псж have the funds to make the project viable.
Don't take the title in the league, as last season, will be a huge flop?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we operate fervently wish to win the crown.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, was a disappointment, because we had everything to reach the finals for the first time.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
Earlier this year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux joined in the fight for the title, I think that we have the strength to win.
If you don't think that the media can expect too much from псж?
It's normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have the players.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we home выигрываем 4-0 against Troyes and we still find what раскритиковать, of course, it's a little bit frustrating.
We wonder, what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to introduce a draft of the game.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has two seasons can't go in one-eighth finals, although they also spent huge money!
Given the amount invested, we have presented by 15 points ahead by winter перерыву.
It would be a dereliction of our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" this new псж.
This shows that how увлекательна first league.
I hope that in May we can smile and say to yourself that, as a result, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Псж seem entirely depends on the deeds Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if, say that there is a kind of "златанозависимость.
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to this and he proves that he is the star of the first league.
Wherever he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people that surround it.
What he has done, it really exclusively.
It stimulates and others to improve his game.
Тьяго Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
As you have Euro-2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I earnestly wanted to participate in the euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me grab a little playing time.
I saw many things there, and I came out stronger.
Now I can play good qualification matches.
This is what I hoped since my baptism in blue.
We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave well.
What do you think about the first months Didier дешама led blue?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the group selection for the World Cup.
He was a coach, he is close to the players and inspiration for victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc has reached its goal, he qualified us in euros.
I hope that Didier дешам lead Blue in Brazil.
The good-draw (1-1), вырванная on October 16 in Spain is a fundamental match?
This match has given us confidence in themselves.
Each fought for all.
Before the shock in Spain, in my career was not such matches.

Pay and sell without the help of the banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on the numbered центробанках transactions between the converse parties C комиссионными levies on their treatment.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, a clear political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented сатоши накамото (a pseudonym), at the same time, a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and secure the exchange on the type of BitTorrent protocol, which allows the exchange of files between members of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take биткойны for donations or as a means of payment.
The course биткойна, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011., five months later fell to $2, before return today by about ten dollars (courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange real money or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) a virtual currency in his report, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes биткойн as "the most successful virtual currency," "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Биткоин differs from other types of virtual currencies, as the "credits" used to advance in a video game, which earned during the game or who might buy (and sometimes and exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the operation of exchange controls and processes any central authority.
In all parts of the network биткойн are simultaneously holders accounting books, auditors, issuers of currency, покупателыми and sellers.
How is this network?
Each deal between two users actually happening between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction, signed electronically, using encryption system with the double key.
The network can also check the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file, it is possible to verify that биткойны used in the deal, the book does exist in public accounting, разосланной across the network.
The registration of the new transaction is a key step in this book.
She passes through the mathematical tasks, разосланной computers, decided that, as a central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
Speaking of the phase hashing file, that is, the transformation of a large file in a digital signature, short and unique.
"computers take" new transaction and add to her room, before "хэшировать all together.
The goal is to find the number, which gives a digital signature (many zeros in the beginning).
As soon as the number found, other sites to check that it properly.
Transaction thus finds нерарзрывно associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification will change a digital signature.
If the user with the aim of deception very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished would pay twice in one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed the network - and the other remained unproved, because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer, set a task, receives 50 биткойнов.
To avoid a reward on a regular basis, inflation is divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
The number биткойнов in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by стомиллионной one that leaves another reserve...
Also, the complexity of the task grows with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has experienced ups and downs.
The sites, providing services Bitcoin, were attacked, and биткойны were stolen from the reserves.
"The defect does not apply to the protocol," says Pierre нуаза, who recently launched paymium - the company been paid real money using Bitcoin network.
The ECB also told about the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But the money also have the disadvantage.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as WordPress blog platform, let them.
Recently дорит Ron and Adi Shamir of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed accounting book and found that almost 80% биткойнов not are in circulation.
"giant sales were announced in November.
"Thirty-thousand dollars were exchanged," rejoice Jon Holmquist, working in coinabul, which manages конвертацией биткойнов into gold.
Another author, Pierre нуаза allowances for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a network operating.
His system, paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or advantage payment via mobile phone, but she uses Bitcoin to check transactions, thereby getting cheaper.
A better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is simple to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Just enough to address, which can "see and photograph" phone, clarifies Pierre нуаза, reassuring that there are already thousands of users.
There is a general trend of hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"Before the Bitcoin settles itself, will take place for some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to a variety of risks, considered today elevated, in the case of the system's success.

We went from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (каписа and суроби).
NATO and the Americans should follow by the end of 2014.
The time for the Afghan army regain control over its territory, and for Afghans to choose their own future, not relying only on us.
The US suffered mainly Afghan farmers, which we are viewed as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed by soldiers, and wounded and покалеченными.
The Taliban is made up of former commanders, foreign extremists hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their own traditions, old and archaic, even to them are joining jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are, they sometimes help local insurgents, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West will behave more cautiously.
The withdrawal of French troops from bases ниджраб, which I watched from the height of the hills засаженных almond trees by French loans, was in order.
Convoys of trucks and personnel carriers with helicopter reached Kabul, not being атакованными.
Since the end of 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty at the time, the country was on fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women paid obscurantism these peasants, in which their surpassed al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved, and in our days.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in the position was one of dependence.
The main characters антисоветской war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into the disposition, exciting public lands to resell them under development Olim, returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts subcontract.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, even themselves not fought.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that was not one of the thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those, who managed the American generosity: an outflow of capital is substantial.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during his exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated his advantage.
About 65 percent of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now has more than 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities filled, both boys and girls.
To provide jobs for these young people, who do not want to return to the old parties мракобесию nor for the corruption of some executives.
In all, including the armed militants, like mobile phones, televisions and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world, and who are everywhere.
At the moment the Army is.
The authorities, who will command it, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, the overland ways антисоветскую struggle, is already taking steps to restore provincial guards, who would not be subject to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be to a certain extent децентрализован, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which existed since 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the elections, scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry was not put on her feet, no dam operates, neither ирригационная system not отремонтирована.
All imported; produced nothing, except vegetables and fruits.
The priority given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by 30 years of war, state control over infrastructure would be needed.
Rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral riches.
It only intensified the feeling that Western countries were there only to grab them.
Without energy for processing copper or iron ore on the spot, without the means of transportation, to export them through the mountains, no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the field of copper months айнак, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) раскапывать huge Buddhist complex and remain the biggest employers of the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan must be to similarly in one day, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops ended on November 20.
The new agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: vocational school for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, agricultural, medical and legal fields, support the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 in an effort "to win the hearts and minds" and accomplish the impossible task combining aid with offensive operations, "civil-military activities" under the Ministry of Defense (cimic), упраздненная in 2012, along with a French public institution, has numerous activities aimed at restoring agriculture and public works in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with local labor intensive involvement, could help stem the insurgency, Wells, irrigation and drinking water, restoration of forests, soil protection, fruit trees, and an increase in the area of arable land.
That we leave the memory of himself, having spent two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget посодействовал would improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests the small agricultural work, emanating from local communities in Kapisa.
To get rid of the uprisings, by foreign groups, which want farmers, they told me, you need to give them a small involved support, which would be well controlled and came to him directly.

Heavy deliveries of the constitution in Egypt
It is a risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided on the issue of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him emergency powers, more than ever, he decided to play the all-.
Surprising everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on a final text for the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of the state granted to two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for the past two years, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, in which several times were made amendments that weakens the institutional stability and leads to the legal controversy.
This new initiative only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing "violate the word" and "flout the law."
In his camp followers are confident that this is the way to do away with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which makes the brothers refuse to explain all the text, the article after article.
It is also a way for the president to restore social and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seem convinced that the Egyptians vote positively, as he said in an interview with Us Weekly time.
All the more so that the call for accelerated voting is like the Egyptian people on an ultimatum: "Either you голосуете for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers," which, it is believed, should be complete after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the constituent assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their views.
Human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society representatives have done the same thing.
In order to make the necessary quorum was reached, spare participants, 11 people were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to fellow Muslims.
No wonder that in most cases articles were проголосованы unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, the fact that one of the few disagreements arose позабавил around... the time for prayer, as some members of the committee decided that the constituent assembly watches were incorrectly configured.
The text, in which yesterday's vote, consists of 234 articles.
The object of national attention, Article 2 eventually remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, reading that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi party, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" on the "rules" that would enable them more rigorous application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed is evidence of their goodwill and respect for other members of the Egyptian society.
"hypocrisy," say the liberals, who see it as a PR.
Because, in their view, Islamization of the constitution is going through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives the University of al-Azhar advisory role, particularly in regard to checking compliance sharia laws.
According to the expert on Egypt Sophie помье is worrisome, so the. "people, to make decisions, not elected and no democratic legitimacy."
We can see the emergence of theocracy. "
Many liberals, moreover, взбудоражены fact that the rector of the university, seems to be much less moderate than today's.
"At the moment no particular religious interference.
With this constitution we remain under civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on the text, "it's not Ulema, and people with university education, some studied the French system" reassures Alexis блое, who is preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around may arise under Article 220 ambiguity, as used in terms of it borrowed from the religious profanity.
This applies particularly to the Islamic law, "" fiqh "[note 1].
And the question that may arise in the future as far as civilian judges are competent to decide about it. "
Apart from its religious aspect, the text, adopted yesterday, attacked, because it gives broad powers to the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claim that they greatly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will take place not in parliament, and the National Council of defense.
And it will not be banned from the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the pleas of the Association for the protection of human rights.
The latter has also expressed concern about the text, which they deem detrimental for freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now is an insult that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are no longer talking about the protection of women, emphasizes хеба мораеф, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in the article 36.
The word that never appeared in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to play last night on television, protests are planned today in the afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, would come out on the streets on Saturday.

The Dead Sea hotter, and swim there all year round.
By the way, this is the most amazing sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet - at 417 metres below sea level.
Лазурная water in it - brine, easily keep afloat not even able to swim.
Landscapes around unrealistically beautiful.
Go here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - рапы, and healing mud, and подлечить health when дерматитах, аллергиях, астмах, экземах, артритах, бронхитах, processed diabetes mellitus, to bring the damaged nerves.
Touch to the mysteries of ancient times
It keeps the ancient part of Tel Aviv-Jaffa town on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.

The money for the trip better borrow in dollars rather than in euros, which can easily be exchanged at шекели (now $1 - 3.8 шекеля).
Urban transport - mostly buses, but there are speed tram and subway line in Haifa - the only one in the country, which is composed of six stations in Jerusalem and connects the city with the top.

"The Great and Powerful" to Moscow will: migrants hold money on language
While lawmakers and human rights groups argue that the law gives mandatory language testing, scammers have already appeared in the country, selling "липовыми certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia come 13 million migrant workers.
For the most part it's citizens in Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support their families, remaining at home.
Since the law came into force on December 1, under which each migrant labour must be took the exam on the knowledge of the Russian language.
While this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, retail and life.
But over time, promised in the Federal Migration Service, "the tests will become mandatory for all travelers.
Though to have not only the language, but also of Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language will validate and for more information, and to extend work permits.
The exception applies only to citizens of those countries, where English is the official language.
Do not fall under the provisions of the law and the people, успевшие get аттестаты and diplomas on education before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The downfall and protection of the rights and benefits
The examination centers will operate under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language Pushkin, Moscow State University, the University of friendship of peoples, state and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all cities; now in Russia opened more than 160 such centers.
The Federal Migration Service and the State Duma deputies supported the initiative on the introduction of testing.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask a question in the press, and that is, in fact, give?
That will change the knowledge of the language and for the Russians, and for the travelers themselves?
First and foremost, is to meet representatives of the migration service, "it will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor slavery. "
Many say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan Victor себелев.
The protection of their rights should begin before their departure.
Only organized recruitment system allows up to 90% to solve the problem of foreign workers.
The problems arise from migrant workers without jobs, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without an understanding of the language, "Jorgen себелев, a migrant is bound to face those people under the guise of aid всунут him" the freak "путёвку close Barak, where he and dozens of his ilk will languish for months without food and documents, вкалывая for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one thing, but on arrival to deceive them, select a passport, not pay promised salary," confirms the head of the Main Directorate of labour migration Ms Tajikistan толиб Sharipov.
Not ругайся, насяльника!
Nevertheless, while many citizens Central Asian republics, registering to work in Russia, a country in which sought to admit that not only don't know the language, but also to own something write with difficulty.
Of course, it is not so much their fault, but the problem: few Uzbeks, Tajiks, Turkmens can afford to get even the method employed primary education.
Because their families have not even feed the children, not to mention the idea to dress them decently, May and снаряжать in school.
Дорастая until adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.
Difficult, if poorly with the knowledge of the language, "they are recognized.
"feel humiliated and incomplete."
Human rights defenders in respect of the law on language, however, mark an important point.
The tests will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If the same status, there is no test, no further official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or a stranger entrance воспрещен"
Many of the newcomers say get an official status in our country is not so simple.
The reason is the bureaucratic препонах and all those same language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization of your money's worth: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But leading registration can be done quickly and just over 1,500.
Russian police officers know that we have mostly false documents, no registration, hence cases of extortion.
"for a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists, a citizen of Tajikistan умед хушкадамов.
"налетай, not скупись, buy the painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law found that false documents for registration are not only the migrants' families.
Several of the "sham" certificates of the language tests have already seized by the Federal Migration Service.
Fake paper exposed on a color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, надеявшихся thus relieve itself the task of tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This two-times more expensive procedures in the official test: it will cost Labour worker in three thousand.
In fact, that the main challenge in the near future "to protect the system of corruption," Brown "was not simply buy, and officials agree, and human rights activists.
Meanwhile the authorities can promise гастарбайтерам, not to successfully undergo testing for the first time, while the study of the basic language course.
In addition, visitors don't know Russian, will be offered no jail time, work in the areas of active communication with the people.

The Ministry of the interior does not take into the illegal gun market turnover
The proportion of crimes using legal weapons extremely small
The Russian Interior Ministry proposes to tighten the law in respect of civil weapons.
It is the authorities' response to the recent incidents: hit shots at weddings, when without casualties, and Gore, устроенная Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, the result of which hit seven people died.
Police want to ban the wearing травматики in public places and raise the age from which you can get a license for the weapon - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea of the head of the Duma Committee on security and counter corruption Irina яровая and promised that the amendments to the law on weapons make to the State Duma in the near future.
Not all are pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem through "tightening the screws."
The network has an open letter, the authors whose - representatives of various public стрелковых organizations - need to abandon the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of registered weapons with muggings minimal, told BBC Russian Service lawyer-криминалист Vasily foresters.
According to statistics of the Ministry of the interior, for the first six months of 2012 committed 142 crimes involving firearms, registered in the internal affairs bodies, while just over the same period have adopted thousands of crimes.
The authors of the open letter assured that stricter legislation in the sphere of civil weapons not puts the offender to go on the black market.
Now, according to them, you can find any weapons in Moscow at a low price.
The Ministry of the interior, meanwhile, argue that control the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to military officers
"The black-market weapons is through multiple channels.
Major such channels five, said retired Colonel Victor баранец, ten years worked in the structure of the Ministry of Education and генштабе.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first "Army or military footprint," that is a weapon, which was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons pulled and Russian officers, and the Caucasians," says баранец.
The type of "black" weapons stolen by the representatives of law-enforcement agencies.
Баранец explains that are here and gone from police warehouses, and stolen from directly to law enforcement officers.
The illegal "baggage" go on sale from military warehouses.
For many military warehouses often punctured the explosions.
"There is a proven version that part of arsons were made" to cover a shortage, "says a former military man.
His contribution, said баранца, making weapons manufacturers.
"Now плодятся private arms factories, which does not tolerate competition on the international market and throw a gun from under the floor on the black market, including Moscow," an expert says.
Another source of "black market" - smuggling.
Especially comes a lot of rifles and pistols from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There's a Mafia and its production, and sometimes members, which organized the flow," says a former military man.
Where the weapons?
Experts thought, what is the approximate share each supply sources of illegal weapons on the black market.
The troubled centre of state-management planning and analysis prepared a report about it in 2011.
Experts analyzed reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Rosstat, криминологическую literature and open data portals on gun issues.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and law-enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "in which officials, whose work is connected with their weapons," the report says.
According to the researchers, 17 percent of the weapons come from places of armed conflicts, at 14 percent of cases occur theft at the stage of weapons production accounts for 5 percent of the "black archaeology."
The seller, a consultant of weapons stores, who did not give his surname, assures that the weapons, found black копателями, long ago nobody buys is too old.
More often than not, as he says, the new party sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through прапорщика man buys unit, for example, the TT pistol.
He discharged her, pass through the fence.
"He carries it into the city and now sells for 900 euros per share with two shops," he said
"However, the police in the course of all cases, so from time to time when burning plan for solving crimes, is examining the purchase from traffickers of illegal weapons," added the consultant.
"as in the luxury store"
The seller and buyer often find each other through an acquaintance.
I did on Web sites, blogs, not yet answered comrade, who offered to come to the platform "running," where will people, which for me in the corner, "where we will bargain.
The barrel price I learned only there
The military observer Viktor баранец
To get a gun, I need a friend, has an exit, "said the consultant." I have a friend there, but I don't believe in it.
Sellers in the markets there, but there also needs to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to transfer, the daughter of a tooth out."
I am now even a couple) take over human rights, in which certain.
He also provides them only me, because he knows that I can't rent it.
Newcomers seeking weapons of different ways.
A former military Victor баранец tried himself in the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
The scheme, he said, have not changed.
He gave the album with pictures, where there was "anything."
"I felt like in the store," recalls military.
The buyer, said баранца, does not offer a cat in the bag - all you can try.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - we drive with the seller in the forest, they set a target.
"Give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I убеждаюсь that weapons hits well begin to negotiate," one expert describes the procedure.
The shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet address on websites and groups in "VKontakte," where "offer to buy weapons for different purposes."
It does not need any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," write the advertising cap on the site "to combat a pistol or rifle."
On the site users leave their bid and ask questions.
But minors can sell?
"without a license, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (SIC saved).
"buy" тт.москва tersely formulates the request "федоренков."
The Federal Security Service now разбросила a vast network of fake sites and wanting to buy a military weapon than a shovel.
People go hungry fish on прикормку, then scrape in Siberia coal
The military observer and a former military Victor баранец
I have heard of such schemes, usually the site registered outside the actions of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through cash payments.
"In response to send a photo and instruction, where hidden weapons," said a spokeswoman for the public organization weapons on the "right" Dmitry Kislov.
Victor баранец argues that leaving the application on the site, you can get behind bars and stay without weapons.
The Federal Security Service now разбросила a vast network of fake sites and wanting to buy a military weapon than a shovel.
"People go hungry прикормку fish, and then extract coal in Siberia," he said.
Makarov for $100
When buying illegal small arms, according to the experts, could meet in the amount of $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry кислова from the "right on the weapon," Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
Will wait a month and a half.
He отгружается from warehouses of the leadership of these long-term storage depots managers.
According to the official стастистике departments, compared with the January-October 2011 the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and accounted for 22.9 million, while the number of identified cases of extortion and theft of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 percent.

In the United States of supermarkets and fast workers go on strike
Through his work at McDonald's hand goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days in America a ride the wave of protests against low wages at a Walmart in department stores and restaurants popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, "Bell," "tacos уэндис" and "Kentucky into the чикен."
While no one is predicting, into whether this surge in the ninth wave or she is destined to expire in the early stages.
The shares are supporting the trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
But the modest increase in wages, which are ordinary workers Walmart and fast-food systems, the major tour organisers of protests is the establishment of trade union organizations in them.
As long as this sector of the economy barely covered the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The shares began last week, after Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America crumbled orgy cheap sales, annexed by millions of consumers and sometimes сопровождавшаяся потасовками.
On this day, some workers at a Walmart, in which around the world are 2.2 million people have left their jobs, and together with the trade unions and left-wing activists picketed Stores Corporation, whose goods provided on modest and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores at an average annual rate of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
So many underpaid workers Walmart come only have themselves at work.
The range and availability of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods sell-off in part because little pay their workers.
Recent also complain about poor working conditions, for example, the shortages finished or hand scanners.
Shares in the "Black Friday" participants demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The average employee Walmart, получающему 9.5 dollars per hour, cannot afford the expense, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raise среднуюю salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the company $3.2 billion.
This is approximately 1.1% more than it currently spends on a salary.
If Walmart entirely переложит wage growth on the shoulders of buyers that they will do every visit to the store just 46 cents more expensive.
For the year, they will spend more on any 12,39 dollars than now.
Supporters of a Walmart rather noted that protests have occurred only in nine states and not have any corporation малейщего damage.
The "Black Friday" continued in its stores with 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday of the next day, and during this time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of her cash machines produced in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
A spokesman for the corporation's Dan фогелман argued in an interview left the site The Huffington Post that jobs left a total of "less than five" Walmart employees, and that the protest was but "the latest пиаровским gimmick" slaughtering its union.
"a free ticket!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where their marriages were not stores Walmart (them in this progressive city not LA, and therefore they are not yet), and the "break" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of dollars of cabins, and after that he didn't even gives you sick and don't pay you for an honest job!
Джумейн Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law is 7,25 dollars per hour.
Fast-food restaurants, over time, increase it, but not much, and in the middle of their ordinary workers receive in New York 8,90 dollars per hour.
No one does not earn less than them in this expensive city.
How can exist in New York on such money, incomprehensible to me.
Once through the "break" was almost a quarter of American teens who подрабатывали behind them come after school, living with their parents.
Few who saw in it the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I constantly наталкиваюсь "макдоналдсов," in an interview with the employees who complain that must live on the salary and sometimes even feed on her children.
On the other hand, hangs on the Wall Street Journal Forum newspaper commentary, the author whose notes that irresponsibly have children, if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday from McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and поварам fast-food systems began to pay at least $15 per hour, that is, more than doubled their current minimum salary.
They also demanded that were established in the sphere of fast food trade union organizations.
U.S. law prohibits the administration that prevent and punish the trade union movement activists harassed and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life.
But to reach a labor union fast food is difficult and for obvious reasons.
One of the main - extraordinary turnover.
Restless
Noisy protests took place in this day and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The action came in the mid-day rally at McDonald's near Times Square, on which made several local Democrats, in particular, a member of the city council джумейн Williams, insisted: McDonald's says he sells billions of dollars of cabins, and after that he didn't even don't pay you for an honest job! "and gives you the hospital.
The demonstrators supported and other prominent Democrats in New York, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor Bill de бласио, insisted that "we must join together in support of fast-food workers with the fact that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every new йоркец!."
As the New York Times described the incident, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, though not all of them were fast-food workers, in which tens of thousands of people employed in New York.
While it is unclear whether this would spark the flames of a mass movement.

"As long as fool the brain is either"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme of augmented reality lately is seen largely through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Microsoft and Google, and then became aware that the application filed for a patent in November.
But from a conversation with the head of the group interactive 3D technology in a laboratory кэмбриджской Microsoft шарамом изади is that for this company scientists points - continue stage.
Them an opportunity to manipulate virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, a virtual open spaces.
- please, in general terms, what is your research group?
"We are human interactions with machines, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far in the mass of humanity, at the stage of work with the pixels on the flat screen, sometimes тыканья in them the finger.
We also want to look for 5-10 years ahead and predict the drastic changes in this interaction.
The Xbox console and the Kinect sensors, for example, is a step forward, and almost no one today without Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because all interesting жестовое management.
Is that still awaits us ahead?
"Despite the fact that Kinect suffered interaction on the physical level, a lot still comes on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Enter information improved (system) gets more data, and the conclusion is not very.
We're trying to change that, working on a 3D display systems on the basis of various technologies, including проективных.
To release the computer world in our, physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but the space around him.
Then we can add to the real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell these stupid helmets virtual reality!
"What do you think about voice control?
The popular thing, but not overestimate it?
"It certainly can't be described as a panacea - the question of privacy, because they don't always want to notify people about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own market niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project, in which we thought of gestures, but not over), and over such being stingy, short.
At the same time gestures filmed наручным браслетом rather than the device's camera that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
As long as he is big, but in theory it is possible to reduce the size of the watch.
But in general the future for the hybrid type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.
"Is it?
- for example, how can you ask me to give you the bank for the pizza?
You say and at the same time show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
"So you want to get users to adapt to what may, or may not, at the moment the car?
- does not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think, in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that allow more accurately determine a person's reaction.
It may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
"If you talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensor, which claims to modern cameras?
Lack of authorization, depth or something else?
"In principle, it is the current generation, from which you can work in our work on 3D with big demands.
Of course, it was nice to get 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 Mbps.
But it's not in themselves мегапикселях, as well as the matrix and depth.
From the point of view of all current technologies for us isn't good enough - it adds to the work of designers algorithms.
That is to be remembered not only about the resolution on the axes X and Y, and z.
Also, the number of frames per second, the speed is very important.
The movement of the person is dynamic, and the current 30 to / from frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen бетишес from our рэдмондской laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 milliseconds, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) index.
Not all understand how it affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would be in my work very extensive equivalent of such a device, not only requires касаний that frames per second was more.
- and there is no need to increase the number of cameras?
- the Kinect now has three "camera," one of which is actually the infrared излучатель, and the second - receiver reflected signal.
As for the third, the camera is, in fact, a sensor, the visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it, increasing the amount of payments.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect, play with кривизной location cameras and see how it will help in 3D determining provisions.
"As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, not presented to the public his glasses.
You don't think in terms of daily use augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising technology platforms?
"Of course, all the while разгуливать, holding a smartphone in raised their hands, not very comfortable, but it's what I think: the steep option would be" переходящая restricted reality, when cloud-based platform, you could switch with points on a smartphone, the projection screen and then everywhere.
The glasses are a very personal device, their strength in this (private things you see only), and at the same time the weakness is restricted reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
"Imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holographic objects in the air is not only Tony старку from" Iron Man, "but also an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that often point critics such ideas: no тактильного revocation!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers your group prepares to this challenge?
"I often say that restricted reality is the seventh in his lectures on the account of a breakthrough in the interaction between human and machine.
Think eighth may well be a supplement of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile one interesting tricks - the use of a second hand as a substrate for images.
It perfectly captures keystrokes!
But there is technology, which is aimed at giving it a "plethora" pictures in the air - for example, интерференция several aim ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where there is a finger, gives a sense, but as long as it is very weak, as if you blew on the pads.
The wrist bracelets, which affect nerve endings in the fingers and there is also a promising direction.
"And you were trying to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels that seemingly should feel at that moment, when he sees something?
Is this a good idea, we haven't tried to do so.
Here is another task, over which will have to fight for a long time - how to make a person is physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is going to open, almost infinite - work and the concepts of running tracks (not moving platforms, such as the clubs), as well as huge balloons.
While fool the brain is the medium, the work is still very much for many years.
What makes the work of virtual reality so attractive to the investigator - many things in its infancy.

Вкусовщина instead of culture - росбалт.ру
Rosbalt continues to project "by the avant-garde," dedicated to the townspeople, who are ahead in the vanguard of culture and art.
At the top of the list already were vivid figures art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing national notoriety.
A new hero "росбалта" эпатажный artist Cyril Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller, a bearded man dressed in all red, which meets the Russian Museum, the fashion, the summer garden parties and вернисажах.
The paintings Cyril Miller has not always gather a crowd of spectators, wherever they are.
Kirill Miller - one purely Petersburg social and philosophical сказочников, the creators of the new lift.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant man Petersburg avant-garde in the late 1980s to the early 1990s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing smile among the citizens, encourage the mood.
Recently he took at the hands of the Petersburg шарманщиком шарманку, as ripe for this complex role with all my богемным existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still go around the city in the red, but not in yellow or бирюзовом, for example?
"I chose the color red as a fashion designer who view and image.
In this world the color red is a compromise between the artist, имиджмейкером and society.
Although everyone in society that almost no grey, causing agitation and aggression malign properties.
But my provocations aimed at ensuring that the conversation began.
The whole history of my provocative shares - an invitation to debate.
"And when you realized that must be an artist?
"My work in the theater where the Nevsky were displayed at the exhibition.
I realized that this is my path.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists staged, a new, free like me were unintelligible.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with постгазоневщиной, which led to the "Pushkin-10," and there was more waves.
My throws in music, clothes, theatre, in all genres, but the words.
"And all this combined in your art clinic." I was important experience in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where should gather all the best creative forces.
In 1995 I took the territory on Pushkin-10, and there has not yet been repair, a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the St. Petersburg богемы house.
Many there were born: номы, tequila-jazz, remember cord led with the project, "Van Gogh's ear."
Cord and his friends sang under light plywood songs, they were in обтягивающем tights, among them was fashionable now composer Igor vdovin.
When the group parted alive, she became "Leningrad."
Трахтенберг was leading many programs to галивских-hahli era.
We gave them трахтенберга, and went to his great career and basic education and upbringing he had received.
"Gallery on 137 of the club," "грибоедов is resulted from art-clinic.
There the habitués and our employees are gone.
I'm the hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was "the people of our city."
In the category of "artist of the year" was named I ended my climaxes.
In the new times by the old rules uncomfortable work, I'm a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years easily become popular, but the culture and popularity are, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"Your work is modern style.
"Many hits in them is my pictures vividly reflects the severity and urgency.
My program will be the exhibit, "the Russian Museum in the клоунах."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used social was, now look like this is painful and scary.
But in the tragic irony, all размазывается клоунах shot.
I love we have гротесковые ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian dressing isn't right.
Now on clothes face, based on foreign mechanics, not on the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand to it and spit it in a face.
And the fraud will be lifted by dressing.
"As we recently saw you in the city's role at the organ-grinder." the cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, like me, they have.
"Well may and commercial art can be beautiful?
"Now the commercial art should be careful and considerate, sweet.
A disintegration of cultures.
Before people crowded together in flocks, богема one loved, простаки another.
Now all crashed on микросообщества, now it's hard to please everyone.
I don't стодолларовая paper that all like.
Now we need to think who you like.
Now every 100 fans of cult hero.
"And the стаса Mikhailova comes as several thousand!
"Come on him брошенки, where сексо-social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds 300 people will come, and 10,000 not come, and as a result fewer management, money, still languishes.
I have fans, the important thing is don't deceive them, not spoil possessions.
I wrote in his youth such paintings that have one collector they hung on the wall beside ларионовым and фальком.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confused notions.
Say: the spiritual culture, a culture of consumption.
In no culture of consumption is from another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, rose examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, abandoned for the sake of money drawing pictures.
I for one's culture.
- Kirill, which lacks high drama?
"good cultural experts.
There is such a thing, an official from the culture.
But not all of them can engage the culture.
If correct tsars was all wrong, Kings, maybe not quite understand the culture, but they understand that you need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg is that the experts, but they could be closed, as will require higher experts, who correctly will appreciate these experts and give them the way.
Now thrives вкусовщинка.
The same эрарта, but they are what they honestly say that not all modern art we accept that there are artists who have sought to other museums.
- What is it for you - St. Petersburg?
"St. Petersburg is not much more of a culture where the soil is in Moscow, the cultural capital.
And on our stones art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, and we have now more than readers, writers, it is wrong.
That's a lot of people in Europe любопытствующих. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have also made this layer.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Having in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with an asteroid-killer.
Caravans spacecraft with землянами aboard go for the search for extra planet.
To save humanity, raises the question, how to continue his race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, only two of these planets, which can develop at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said a senior fellow at the National Astronomical Institute named п.к. Sternberg (the Sai (Vladimir сурдин).
But if the conditions more suitable for life on Mars, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures up to 500 degrees.
Can only live at a high altitude or the orbit of Venus... in outer space.
Approach human reproduction in space began with flora.
A half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations already in orbit peas were no different from their earthly varieties.
Then - getting into the orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-дрозофил.
In 1979 перепелок eggs are sent into space to see how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get to withdraw completely normal having.
But beyond the problem begins.
"The problem is related to the fact that this птенец should find support, he should get back on their feet and start moving," said Head of Laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical problems (Vladimir сычев имбп) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Not finding support, the chicks fluctuate кувыркались.
But after 10 hours of the newborns was complete atrophy instincts.
The chicks don't have responded to the light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days, they just died.
"and two times we вылупляли baby, after it refused, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," concludes the failure of an experiment with Birds in Space Vladimir сычев.
The last time with animals biological "миниковчег flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments continue.
But the биоспутнике "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
He was an experiment with mice that have been sent into space with a fetus.
In principle, there was nothing unusual.
"It was just a биоспутниках, but again, this is an experiment, and to conduct such research," said Vladimir сычев.
After landing from space rats appeared offspring.
But approach to the problem of duplication directly in space until it.
No easy task.
The animals, losing, customary habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
The same man, unlike зверюшек, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thinking, and in a position to create подобающий emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are being carried out.
But women in space travel for 50 years.
Tereshkova's had the greatest risk.
But the most precious thing that humanity is have a woman's body.
Our PM Chaika, and no one on earth could not say whether he will remain after the flight into space.
Whether she would have the baby after the flight.
"On this issue because no one answered," says a veteran aerospace industry Vakhtang вачнадзе.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to her daughter.
The father of the child андриян Nikolaev also was cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana савицкой, twice tested in orbit and even поработавшей in outer space, the son was born.
But the risk remains.
We have little, units are astronauts, from whom after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation.
"But if more, then it is dangerous even when orbital flights," concludes the Hero of Russia, the hero of the Soviet Union, cosmonaut Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity must find some new way in biotechnology, protection against radiation, creating artificial gravity.
The CPC гидролаборатория - mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in a zero buoyancy astronauts work skills in outer space.
The water mimics weightlessness.
If the water for adults, albeit convenient, but still the alien environment for newborn children - one element.
Small ихтиандры if confirmed - life on the land out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months mummy in окоплодной fluid, it is easier to get used to it, then to водичке.
In principle, it is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment the first swim, is only two weeks.
"It is very little to forget something," says the instructor грудничкового swimming Marina Aksyonov.
In a word, if a child is born to weightlessness more natural state, it is necessary for a woman gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness дряхлеют muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, reduces the ability to выталкиванию fruit.
Oh well, skip it, relying on stimulants generic activities.
You can, of course, in a special cell to go on birth, chasing it.
"And then what?" asks include questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.
No sense of Earth's gravity, the body does not form the skeleton and muscle system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, dress in a costume for training load.
He simply would be deprived of the fact that he will be vital.
"And this experiment, in which we go with you, assuming the birth of a child in the alien environment, an amputee would lead to the fact that we bring to the ground, fully дезадаптированного man," foresees the head of the Committee on bioethics имбп Ras Igor пестов.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
Over time, however, it will be a reality, when earthlings on their ships head on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.

The head of the control department: Schwartz-checking system failed the fault of politicians.
In the field of government procurement the Czech Republic has good control authorities and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lagging in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice-president of the Supreme Security-management department, in an interview for the website aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough," commented the current situation Kala.
A similar conclusion provides a joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices are Peter нечаса approach to the so-called Schwartz-system.
Recently, the prime minister said that the GFC (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs checks - is it allowed or non-smoking?
"The law should be somehow set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister cannot withstand the institutions, which compelled to check and to fulfill their commitments," Kala concludes.
At a session of the audit committee in the chamber of deputies, you were talking about a joint project between the German and Czech parties, under which would correspond legislation on public procurement of both countries.
What exactly was it?
A parallel check in mind, we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, the question is, what the law says, how should be public procurement, next to the national legislation and then also apply in practice.
All the information was collected and, even if still unfinished verification, revealed some interesting differences - in short, the legislation may be "infallible and precise," but in practice we use in certain parameters behind Germany.
From this is that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules should focus on the application of the law.
But exactly how this project can help you, what does it mean to you?
This joint control can contribute in efforts to stop the laws, improvement and reduction of restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
The economy is getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always) low price, to avoid enrichment and, possibly, of criminal behavior.
But the fact that we can't achieve this, reducing restriction orders.
Perhaps this system переполнится "securities" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restriction does not dropped.
You talk about internal problems practical application of the law on public procurement.
But as the control system operates in Germany?
Is there such an organization like ours KRU ревизионное-security (management) or it works differently?
As for institutions, there as our KRU advocates bundesrechnungshof, which in our principle, there is also the board, working a little bit differently, but mostly both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the authority to some extent similar, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a unit of audit and at the level of the federal lands - in that their system is somewhat different from ours.
Brh could manage only federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled by the computational Chambers at the federal level.
As for local laws, it's easier than we have?
In general, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can take, for example, but you can't definitely say that she is better at all.
So, because they cope better with the control?
Definitely not, but again, I don't like such comparisons.
But we must say that even the model of the country are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right?
If you talk about domestic legislation as an amendment to the law on public procurement, somehow, reflected on your show the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is short, it still does not appear in our works under control.
As we have control, in fact, be some delay.
Take this into account in preparation of future inspections - we only began to use our new tool "неэкономности risk detection," through which we are almost 14,000 state contracts. "We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will occur, because change restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
How do you think the approval of this law will benefit or an extra burden on the system of the bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope he is.
The problem, which may arise, such that the rules "ужесточатся" and it will be impossible to observe.
Under the previous rules-controlled enterprises intertwined with the provider (e.g., Regional Operational programs - with the regional council) in the fact that any violation of the law on public procurement is a violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether in this case to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think in this way.
The system should exclude those who wants to capture and abuse, but not punish those who commit the formal mistake, not a decision on Ukraine.
Such a system would only create even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
And while out of this situation?
Let's recognize that this path does not lead anywhere.
The prime minister recently said that GFC will not disturb entrepreneurs checks so-called system-Schwartz. What does it mean?
"Schwartz-system" permitted or banned?
The law should be somehow set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister cannot withstand the bodies, which compelled to check and to fulfill their commitments.
You can say: "We're this law and solve it," but you can't say that we will pretend as if nothing happens.
The law on public procurement has very strict rules, as well as what is right, and should be formally. This would protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic when a candidate with the best offer only disqualified because of technical shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly, which, in my opinion, we don't have enough.

In some places the Czech Republic cold and snowy roads.

Shimon орнест: at concerts we want to accumulate a positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than one month should come the end of the world?
It is just one of many-disturbing news, on which we, the people, so easily попадаемся.
Together with the band the tap tap we constantly fact on this issue and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to muster enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three-concert against the rest of the world.
Could you tell readers about it?
Talking about national fundraising event, which we plan for as long as two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential, which has about the end of the Mayan calendar, which announced on December 21 at 11: 10.
The day before the event, on December 20 at 21: 00 parallel runs three concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They are gone, to put it bluntly, the moment on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific time zone which up to 12 hours earlier than we have, ends May calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, we were all together with our artist гонзой аугустой.
Besides the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to reflect together with the public, the condition of the world once we send our children.
On the occasion of the level of the calendar we have created a unique collection of objects from a T-shirt, shoes, handbags and original ключиков against the rest of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thereby to support us.
The group tap tap along with other musicians also performed the anthem is against the rest of the world, which is known as the "end of the world."
If our audience already sounds YouTube anthem on these бенефисных concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will be all right and the end of the world don't come.
His запоют all performers at all concerts at the same time.
Anthems simultaneously ring as well as in a live broadcast of Czech television.
The words to the song he wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomas ганак, participates in the performance also xindl X...
As you have begun to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities Czech cultural life, because we have a lot of charitable events and concerts.
Try actively connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they wonder.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the rest of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for educational center безбарьерного studeo, already the sixth year so we are working with the civil association tap at the Institute едлички.
Teachers regularly attend school students of the Institute едлички and have fun and interesting activities with them.
The students themselves do not have the money to go to teachers, and so we try to give them that opportunity.
In the framework of the additional construction project institute едлички a separate building in the future, in which we переедем with this project.
At each concert will several bands and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that interested all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will Chinaski, support lesbiens, illustratosphere with Dan Barta, the Tap Tap, participated банго and its сухи.
You can learn about all the details on the website www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan any such "grandiose event" in the future?
In May will, for the first time, to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, приготовим interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year we would like to have an idea of the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The group tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you forge ahead with expensive in terms of organisation and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five players on electric wheelchairs, their strollers must travel in the cargo hold of a large amount of cargo and drawers, in addition to the instruments.
However, until this справлялись without problems. The Czech Airlines ČSA and British airline British Airways have always been great for us prepared that I surprised many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, all passed without any problems.
Through выездам abroad you can compare different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes toward the disabled, and so on.
With what you have by now?
After Madrid, London, Luxembourg, and other countries, where everything is better than we had, in Russia, we witnessed what in the East is still at a basic level.
Compared with Prague in Moscow, there are a lot of barriers, and there is still a surprise independent movement of a man in an electric wheelchair at the center of the city.
Also there in the banal things such as a disabled person in the elevator to the road.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
But what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance that far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who is concerned.
In London and Madrid perfectly normal that people with the severe form of disability to move on the streets, can go to the bathroom, in the museum, yes anywhere...
There is not much that a large number of people with disabilities participate in public life, and in this we are with the tap tap a little bit superior!
The respect of the public or безбарьерность is one thing, but at the moment, when among us are well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, the ground and then everything will change.
So far, this isolated cases, people with a strong will.
The group tap tap currently very popular, but back on two years ago that in 1998 you caused her to?
I entered the institute едлички as the teacher, there was a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
But because I am a musician and play in a interesting musical circle including the saxophone, along with a colleague.
Well, but over time, as our leading ладя ангелович says, it's a little bit run amok (laughs).
The same popularity came only in the last few years, or something I путаю?
It is true that helped us what we started to join famous singers and actively working on the group's propaganda.
We came to the conclusion that the work, which no one can appreciate, essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the European Union means we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
The goal stood before you so well turn the tap tap?
From the very beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, подражающей one another.
It is logical that all new shall be taken with caution, and it lasts for a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I'm here to say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression of the man who sees us, of course, sorry, it naturally.
But this sorry completely излишня, because people with disabilities are not any backgrounds and all abandoned by individuals, whom we should pity.
They are the people who can live a full life and evolve, of course, only under the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if something happens in people with disabilities, this shift is not only for them, but for the whole society.
Whether the success that you provided a strict head, what do you think?
If we want to do the job properly, we must be in many things hardcore and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week to walk into rehearsal, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But it happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
At the present time as a group the tap tap twenty people.
How many of them were in the beginning in 1998?
Only one ладя ангелович.
We open the group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and the strength of will, our doors are always open.
He will be held Thursday, the day before the expected end 20.12.2012 at 21.
The concert will be held in Prague in the stadium - in the club fléda in Brno and Ostrava Incheba - in the centre plynojem involving 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert all three cities joining телемостом at the time of the execution of the group's songs the tap tap the "end of the world is abolished."
The goal of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons for multifunctional безбарьерного equipment for an educational center studeo with едлички Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 kroner, for children up to 12 years free entrance tickets can be purchased in advance at bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency's Poland adopted twentieth as a member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the European Space Agency on September 12, 2008).
Poland started the close cooperation with the European Space Agency in 1994 and took an active part in a number of projects over the next years of the agency.
But Poland's path to space began much earlier.
Before World War II Polish enthusiasts have flights into space, but it's not always found with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, about a lecture. Штернфельда that December 6, 1933 represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from its pioneering work "introduction to the космонавтику."
The idea of a young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience unfazed, after a few years штернфельд recalled that only Dr. Yang гадомский was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France штернфельд won the prize Robert эсно пельтри and Andre Luiz хирша for the "introduction into the космонавтику."
Dr. Yang гадомский (1899-1966), referred to above, later became a great пропагандистом Astronomy and Space Science.
He wrote a number of books devoted to this discipline and published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines.
Гадомский became known worldwide пропагандистом space, and his contribution was praised in particular the fact that one of the craters on the opposite side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway дрезина, equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea has remained a mystery, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear even for acceleration or braking carts, the rocket was to be used.
Information about this дрезине known only from the press of the era.
Since 1933 Polish artillery began thinking about missile стрелах.
The study was section of weaponry in cooperation with professors мечиславом вольфке and Gustav мокжицким.
Of the remaining materials research shows that reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops work was interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized press appeared idea фотоэлектрической rocket-fighter, which offered рогозинский engineer, and the following year was working "aerial torpedo-missile and rocket-and-bomb" aviation author леливы-кживоблоцкого.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engine.
Before the war all projects military use of missile technology was temporary the Scientific Advisory Committee (tymczasowy Komitet doradczo-naukowy), which coordinated the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity work ended because of the start of the war.
The scientific work, dedicated to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish society space (Polskie Towarzystwo astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 magazine "problems," in which published four wordy article on астронавтике.
In one professor m. Суботович offered to organize a society that will engage космонавтикой.
At the same time already gaining momentum projects artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.
Since 1956 Polish society space (ooa) tried to join the International Federation space (founded in 1951), and the autumn ooa became an active member of her.
But in the next year the first chairman ooa Kazimierz заранкевич (1902-1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of space.
In this position, he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956 ooa contributed a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological rocket RM (rakieta meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, выполнившей a scientific study.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
A rocket capable of overcoming the distance of 1,800 meters, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 pounds.
Subsequently, the improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959 tests were carried out on the lake бледовском двухступенчатой RM-2 missiles.
The rocket was about 1.4 meters in length, and her weight was about 11.5 kilograms.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to engage in genuine scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could overcome 14.5 kilometers, and its task was watching высотным wind.
But it was suspended in 1962 to further development.
Heiress became the first missiles of the type of RM meteor-1 rocket, developed in the years between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was conceived as двухступенчатая, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Developed by three types (identified as meteor-1A, -1в and -1с), who were split by the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, or meteor-1C - 0,62л.
All three types have a maximum range of flight was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968, took place at the Aviation Institute of meteor-2 missile development, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor missile-2 with initial weighing 380 kg was able to cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the meteor-2н version was built and meteor-3.
Should also mention Poland's membership in the Committee on Space Research (коспар) in 1960 and the establishment of a national committee коспар two years later.
In addition, in the framework of the intercosmos, Poland participated in Soviet artificial satellites in space research, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav гермашевский became the second интеркосмонавтом after Vladimir ремека.

The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The ruling sparked heated debate in society.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the topic from a broad perspective.
The liberal-oriented economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of a multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that separate economic units, the national economies, are in constant conflict with each other.
It is connected with the principle of free trade and free, no restricted the movement of private capital along with unrestrained financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) raises price tension.
Under this concept to understand the condition, when producer by delivering cheap goods to survive in the economic competition, however, that "misleading" cost competitor to pick up a large part of the market, and thus increase their own income.
On a massive scale that means for most entrepreneurs or shifting production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries, where labor costs, compared with others, high.
Because private capital has no social responsibility, including unemployment is produced for them are inevitable state spending on social spending.
On the whole, the situation is the unwillingness gentlemen employers pay taxes and thereby offset public economic and social harm them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that you don't have to be specific statistics.
Бесцеремонные methods of private capital create economies at the level of individual states situation, when governments are forced to compete with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population with the aim of attracting foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the government put the population at the mercy of their own private capital, despite the social decline.
It is also reflected primarily to change the current legislation.
The goal is economically make your ​ ​ people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the areas of wages.
It operates as a system of economic coercion in the event of prolonged unemployment and, at the same time, serves as an instrument for cuts workers' rights in the area of labor laws.
As a result of increased levels of poverty, and at the same time, and the gap between rich and poor.
In Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves their own labor.
The number of these people are already approaching $1 million.
Within the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy constantly cases occur, when employed people receive a salary that state they must доплачивать, so they got a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
The economic measures in virtually all of the southern states of the EU, will undoubtedly lead to the same condition, in which people, under pressure from the catastrophic fall social status, forced either to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist at extremely low pay on the outskirts of society in the hope that someday private investment capital comes into the country.
But the question is, where he would?
If the funds come from other EU countries, while poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as well as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, an Egyptian, African still works for European share of wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media to nausea argue that the state cannot participate in the equity capital management, which managed the economy will lead to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not managing actions to interfere in the economy.
Further should answer the question is not whether private capital, now almost managing policy and to the entire state, in their own selfish purposes?
A definitive answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and the omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result, we have a situation безысходную проявляющуюся in corruption, ensuring mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost everyone deserves punishment, but it is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is that the public ministry due to a lack of financial resources are drafting bills to private law firms, which are closely related to the industry.
Then the Bundestag claims these bills.
All power comes not from the people, Western-style constitution reads, and from financially powerful groups, prefer their own interests.
Obviously, the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly turns in such ​ ​ situation, as described аппианом at work "the crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Pompeii and Caesar's": "The state has long been falls, and agencies involved in the violence.
The bribes, illegally receiving handouts with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any taboos, and people went to vote with pre-sold "voice" decent people never баллотировались for the position of the ruler, ultimately, once the state for eight months left without consul "...." seriously started talking about the fact that the energetic man "autocracy and necessity of choice is the only salvation in this terrible situation.. аппиан thought it was Pompey, but they became Caesar, who had replaced on democracy and autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard for the public interest.
Private capital has at its core is not intended for use in public purposes.
The result is no different from the past: unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to reform itself deeper character.
The cause of fascist and communist regimes means we should look for the reckless economic liberalization of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date the existence of the liberal type of democracy and the absence of these regimes can be seen as a pause, after which the next round is expected.
First and foremost, tragically, that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, social and humanitarian catastrophe that we now see, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and the new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least will not last forever.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and at the national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will boost shares of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of state and private capital will weaken a monopoly position in society in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"The violence will not do, and never could get" sting, the song "fragile," where the main стихом рефрена are the words: "Don't forget what we're fragile."
"If my sons don't want war, they would not have been" dying at hatterelles шнапер, wife меера амшела Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, caused a lot of feedback.
Some favor Israel, defending his position, however, that he has the right to self-defense, but Palestinians are in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, the Israeli state, and the state of Israel to the role of a terrorist state.
I don't want to speculate about who in these periodically repeated waves of the killing the victim is the criminal, and who, in the end, today's Israeli citizens, including самоуправляемые territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and has not been seen since the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a glimpse behind the curtain, take a look at the people first and foremost are going for 95 years of tension (counting from signing the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning backed historical facts, some of them are on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the story of the struggle for power.
In every era, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less clear is whether these people to take their own steps, or someone who stood behind the throne of them directed their actions to advance its goals.
Should admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and something from them, the authorities could not happen for the life of a single generation.
Among the rich families астрономически is one that could be seen as the head of octopus (I don't know whether someone is on them, but it's not excluded) - Rothschilds.
Don't write a lot about them.
Of course.
The news agency (Reuters) they bought already in the 1990s of the 19th century, to put an end to rumors linking their name with criminal action in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and that has led to consolidate their power, augmenting the wealth or at the same time, and in addition to another.
Among them are key stakes in almost all of the world's central banks, and against the countries whose central banks, they do not have their own shares, they have or are preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only seven countries, after the invasion of Iraq was five countries, only four remained after Qaddafi's ouster, but, at the same time, the Russian government pledged his country's central bank in their own hands.
Anyone who tried to resist this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank for ротшильдовским Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own понимай (-) government money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Federal Reserve (Fed). The deputy Luis макфадден was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst of global power in the period from 1859-1871 year led to the development of the plan of three world wars, created a great Mason 33-tier Albert пайком.
The first task of the war has been the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially in the UK, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to approximately 0.5-1 billion (such a number of slaves would be enough to provide for them comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything else, except as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final grab absolute power.
Method by which working group of the richest families headed by Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order AB Chao is the order out of chaos.
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the base of the Fed, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis, caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by killing габсбургского heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed by Tsarist Russia Bolshevik революциию.
The first world war ended in sudden, unreasonable given and economically surrender of Germany (no longer have the necessity of a war for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European powers of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to facilitate the launch of the second world war the bankers and politicians have latent conflict situation, imposing on Germany huge war reparations, as a precondition to radicalization of the impoverished masses, then had only given the Germans are strong enough, обличающего guilty and offering simple solutions leader, on a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a fifth column, while stoking the fire of war.
In the late 19th century Rothschilds provoked one branch, the founding of the Zionist movement, which sought to create a Jewish state, with Jerusalem as its capital, the return to Zion, preferably in the history of the Jews.
The draft declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews in Palestine, to be the first clashes with the local Arab population.
The terrorist attacks there on both sides.
The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler has resurfaced in chains, in which it had originally planned, the bankers, or anything that he did, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was driven by the military репарациями on World War 2-Yu, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create the war home third.
If the international bankers can unleash it, the Jewish people, as well as in the second world war, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now with Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of contention and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (take only the sharp divide people on both supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if all started with individuals and their pursuit of global power greed?
Here we need to distinguish them from ordinary people of Israel of leaders, because, as we have, international bankers подсовывают people to vote in the elections only their own candidates.
Israel's current Prime Minister Netanyahu's Hawk is a typical example fascist, loyal to the international bankers politician, makes everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), will threaten to escalate the conflict in the world, and given Iran's control of the strait ормузским containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (судоходный corridor is only two miles wide), "and it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In which light now are the words, said David Rockefeller in 1994: "What we need is a crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
This is a new world order in their view of the World Masters and slaves.
The rest of the world, where the rest of the human population serves горстке financial aristocracy, наслаждающейся comfort.
The world, where everyone born body at birth имплантируют chip, with whom he is being under a total control.
"and makes all large and small, rich and poor, free and slave have on the right hand or on your forehead brand, so people who are not labeled in the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
That wisdom: anyone who has the mind can calculate the number of the beast.
But is it the name of man, and the number is six hundred sixty-six.

The film "Argo" operation: when worse nowhere, call Hollywood
A crowd of Islamist students in November 1979, demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be freed in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, either fled after the revolution in the United States, which has been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
For the US administration was not a positive outcome of the situation - she could not afford to throw away the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
But to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, she was not in the state.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later placed a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The diplomats were finally freed after 444 days, after talks brokered by Algeria's government.
Their fate has provoked a wave of solidarity and антииранских sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran have largely contributed to the defeat Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, ended the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, срежессированный actor Ben Affleck's "Argo" operation describes one of the episodes of history, which brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy six workers managed to escape.
After the complex changes they finished their way into the Canadian Embassy residence.
The CIA in cooperation with Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, at the same time helped an legend cover, according to which they rode on the Canadian sea as the location for filming crew members of the group, the country's подыскивавшие science-fiction epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the "evacuation" expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
So the legend was true, in specialized magazines, wrote about the film project, said at a press conference, fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time held in secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony мендеса.
The film аффлека is a combination of several genres.
On the one hand, real political thriller, the so-called "film-киноопус success story," lead nowhere, fraud is an example might be a series of films about оушена friends.
In the film are constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented задуманные scenes from Tehran (a subtitle identifies signal historical photographs of events and how the same situation were demonstrated in the movie - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, criss-with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - the men in suits are discussing the situation to the negotiating table, on the staircases institutions, on the phone...
Ben аффлеку remarkably accomplished рестарт career.
From высмеянного actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be an object of ridicule.
"After the operation, his third feature film" Argo "dark detective" Goodbye, goodbye, Baby "(2007) and the thriller" The Town "(2010).
At the same time, it is the first film аффлека, who remains in his hometown Boston is the director.
The sense of place in this atmosphere is a quality that heightened earlier films directed by the Hollywood standard.
And it shows in "Argo," Affleck where Tehran "plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which also conveys the confusion and непредвиденности emotions that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues are in the fictional scenes (fake) headquarters in the Tehran Bazaar.
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not suggest a variety of exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works very well with this little, sometimes something додумывает - where it all goes wrong elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis in Tehran's airport, and the chase on runway looks pretty farfetched).
The lack of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the need to show too many things in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but more space, but they would have deserved their characters in the film is far from alone.
The film аффлека lacks a bit dramatic, you can watch a movie with moderate interest, evaluating the and retro-style, воссоздающий thrillers Seventies.
But captures with difficulty.
However, this is enough for reminders about one, yet in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence, as exaggerated notions about omnipotent and всезнающих intelligence.

Rules for bananas, balloons and circus asset
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, annually executes a poll of the most bizarre bank fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd ruling or the project from EU workshop."
"We сподвигло to this recent event, in which the EU plans to take a 40-percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said the organizer of the questionnaire "law" Patrick нагер.
Among the nomination already nominated абсурдностей - the recent decision of the European Court to unify the premium rates for men and women.
So far the women have benefits for life insurance and for insurance companies because they are objectively less подверженными at risk.
"further extraordinary ideas from the EU workshop people can nominate for the contest before the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said нагер.
The controversial EU directives include, for example, and compulsory appendix биокомпонентов in fuel that damages as a result of nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury градусников only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or directive of cages for chickens, resulting in this year significantly tightened the eggs.
Also criticized was de facto ban on the use of the term "бутербродное butter" or withdrawal from Sale classic light bulbs.
High-quality bananas must be 14 inches long.
A pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels usually protected any state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now even threatened вета defends the demands of its banks).
The lobby interests are as follows: for example, higher quality bananas in the EU were to reach 14 cm in length and did not dare to show the "unusual кривизну."
At the same time the European Commission high-order that only гармонизирует existing piecemeal national rules that осложняли trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, yet softened the standards of fruits and vegetables, referring to the fact that the directive will lead to расточению products.
The winning candidate in the poll may be, and last year's ruling, the EU, under which sold balloons need снабжаться warned that children under eight years can't finagle their unattended adults.
The EU appealed to American Studies, in accordance with which balloons in the game are a potential cause of children's death by suffocation.
That restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, which prohibited blowing in ярмарочные дуделки.
Funny ideas are born and at home
Enough is absurd and the European officials regarding the rule: anyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the delicacy theme for the use of the name of Macedonia, Greece, and should instead talk "FYROM (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal bankovnípoplatky.com in co-operation with the Association of liberal economists "the principle of non-interference" (laissez faire), proposed for voting, apart from a few above the absurd rules, for example, the EU rule about the amount of food on the territory of the founding of the state.
The EU imposed the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Later the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, set of canned mushrooms, for which she threatened a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire also excited and pay for some countries for the fact that they have no idea of the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for a statement about getting subsidies.
But these ideas have emerged in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage, because we have the sea.
Ask the European Union for compensation, "said in the fall of 2004 the then Agriculture Minister Jaroslaw Palace (CSSD).
The argument, he pointed out that the country was a grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention buying state was full of warehouses, which was to remove.
For the EU, the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, according to the паласу, we had to pay hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, staged a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies offered villages, the Ministry of Regional Development, руководимое minister Paul German (US-of Moldova Romania), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go on filing on subsidies from Brussels.
The EU: bizarre orders are the exception
Although the decision in the member states could easily become a target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as more effective operation and Development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is черпание EU grants for projects that don't have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which member states have achieved during the discussion of the budget.
Evokes emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products in Brussels, and it doesn't always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and by the Austrians retained the name "оломоуцкие curds," but "туземский rum," tradition has its roots in our country in the 19th century, our producers were to rename the "туземак."
Called for Sherry can only products from cane дистиллята, rather than from sugar beets.
The official list of eligible products in the EU, along with the world famous "горгондзола," and "feta cheeses марципаном from German Luebeck or пармской ham, already have, for example, Mattoni сухари, погоржелицкий and тршебоньский carp and жатецкий hops.
The EU trademark can also be proud of пардубицкий carrot and горжицкие Cork.

People want I guarded Republic, but I'm a big fan, "says окамура.
Mr. senator, comes as a man in the head running for president?
I don't think about how to be a senator or president.
If we have everything in the country function without any problems, I would have never ran.
But I can't watch over the past 20 years the country разворовывается, as people here by thieves, raise taxes and the retirement age.
I have no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like it, then try to find a solution, as this change.
And since I was 40 years old and I am an independent man, not related to any party, I have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of the president or a senator.
In the Senate, you got, but soon went to the presidential palace.
Don't turn you in such a way back to the people that you choose?
I said all the time that включусь in the struggle for the presidential Castle, depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.
Later I said that if I selected by the senator, will run for the presidency.
My goal is not the post office is a tool with which I can carry out their views.
So I need to have the greatest impact and vast powers.
But the problem is not only that we as a nation ропщем at home in a bar or watching television, but at the same time willing to bruise on everyone who tries to change something.
The media, which are added to this man очерняют, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, about me saying that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was counsel its пароубека.
Go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential Castle you started with theses on material and criminal liability of the politicians and on the opposite of property declarations worth more than twenty million.
To accomplish this, we need to change the law.
You have no such powers as president, and only a Senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbying all excursions to become free enterprise, it could push.
The problem lies in политиканстве - when someone comes in with a good offer to the left or right, he deliberately repaired obstacles, and it deters citizens.
As an independent беспартийного person I have a much greater potential for getting support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without the party раскладывания by Heymans, without looking at the premises can take from each party, what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a man, more relevant to the right or to the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me, my people are likely to the left.
No matter - a little bit for me a little bit to the right or the left.
For me it's important that we go forward.
This is not about the fact that someone refers to someone to the left and the right, I want to unite people.
I always support the decision of any good for society, whether it offers the hrcm or GFC, and I'm the same way against bad ideas.
You are angry, when someone says you populist.
But it does not prove whether you what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you have some ideal goals and views as well.
And for that you try to come close.
You can call it populism, but all proposals, about which I say, already operate in the world, or prominent experts say about them.
But without the support of the parliament will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics you don't hold for a long time.
Or do you think that when you out to people and talk with them, then you will be able to implement and criminally responsible?
I have no other choice.
Just try to entice them and convince politicians, journalists and the public on their side, so we have accomplished their goal.
If I was elected president, he would not have made the problems to direct TV broadcasting, in which I turn to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in the event of failure, will tell why they don't want.
If there will be a strong personality, which repeat abuse, then it will be possible to exert pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential elections - it was to public pressure.
Say directly that I'm a lover, not a genius, and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their views and beliefs.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for its programme will try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to promote themselves; in that case, if it fails, to be completed within six years and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like окамура should save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that one, I didn't do anything, so I went around a number of famous people to run for the Senate.
I went to радиму янчуре, he refused in connection with a large volume of work.
Also I at least supported leading investigative journalist Jan лоренцову, which exposed the fraud with a light fuel oil.
I put forward his candidacy because people did their dissatisfaction with the decision, but now I feel in the balance.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, but the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
We only two independents in the Senate.
The people chose the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for direct elections of governors and mayors.
Do you think about the basis of his own party?
I have not thought about it, because I have no time to test the purity of the past each potential supporter, and I have a lot of money on it.
No money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kronor.
You have no money?
You talk about property declarations, and how well your own affairs with this?
Personal property worth approximately 60 million.
I have an apartment, a plot in Prague at a cost of about $25 million to 10 million, another 8 million on an apartment, a collection of works of art around 10 million, Aston-Martin at 3.5 million and Boleslav суперб per million, as well as several million in the account.
The Aston-Martin emerged from me, because it was my мальчишечья dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was галантен with women and, at the same time, fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You take on Aston-Martin, own property on 60 million and you have no money in the campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but do not want their own money invested in it.
It's not very convincing.
I have no more than 15 million on the campaign.
Should I get in debt?
In the campaign, I have already been invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I had no sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign from his pocket.
Spending on the campaign I essentially cover сенаторская salary.
But with that money I wouldn't see, for example, could not pay his son for the English School, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I wanted to just make money, so they would never ran.
So, you want to do business, to live?
Don't you have said that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the paycheck.
As I promised, its activities I partially reduced.
For example, managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like, that I was бессребренником, which will keep the Republic.
But I need to live something, too.
But, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive each month?
From 200 to 400 thousand that get even further.
But if I became president, my business would be finished.
The full interview you find in субботнем edition of the newspaper "right."

The architects km3 argue that these adventures are not only in the imagination - for example спейкениссе and his newly constructed book Mountains -- 2 photos
"It seems to me this building fun, it looks футуристично, finally we have again, you can see something interesting," says лизетте верхайг прохожая on the edge of the road.
But Stefan спермон, the IT specialist at located near a large enterprise, thinks so: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why We today another library?
Everyone has the iPad, Internet and e-books.
Now nobody voluntarily walks in such prehistoric library, right?
Спейкениссе, малопримечательному спальному city under роттердамом, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat that unfortunate fact several years ago decided to contribute to the overall education and build seven fictional bridges, which depicted on the euro notes, as magnificently painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers understood that they have remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library here!
Blame Maass from Rotterdam architectural bureau km3, master bold столбчатых diagrams and author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, regarded by the task with his usual - and appeared to tender an audition in 2003 with a grin on his face and five books under her arm.
And while the members of the jury he looked and winked, naughty Maass pulls out of his original gift пирамидку in size and completed it in defense of his project the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here is my proposal: "Gore's book" in the so-called спейкениссе букенберг!
Nine years later, the mountain has grown at a cost of 30 million euros.
It is part of the ревитализации project, which also includes an underground garage, supermarket, mail and several adjacent houses and townhouses in a total of at least 50 apartments.
In early November, "Gore's book" The best library of the Netherlands was awarded the second prize contest of 2012. "
The project also participates in the national contest Dutch wooden structures of 2012.
Thus, a suburb, who previously could not offer nothing but the postmodern pedestrian zone and surprisingly homely Hall, the white facades which suggests молокозаводе, became richer than the one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important thing is to спейкениссе appeared first in the history of this town public building cultural destination.
The long road to the book
The first impression: a repetition of the Eldorado entered for cheese.
Here only one elevator, held at the center of an array of architecture and reading, because real fans prefer to explore the area on foot.
Остекленное from all sides room is bright and easily foreseeable, the floors of bricks and elegant streetlights unerringly creates a sense of public town square.
The urban environment here perfectly.
View unwittingly looking benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves stand along the facade, and in the middle is a dark room, usually неуютный and a" blame Maass says.
We put the classical configuration of space on its head and dragged the zone for reading from the inside out.
The inner space mountain book used skillfully: located in the center of the offices, Internet chess club, a library, an environmental center and technical facilities.
Especially delight black bookcases that serve the finish walls, then the парапетами лестничными railing.
Their appearance, texture and smell unusual.
Even sophisticated builders, architects and engineers, lost in wonder, what is the unknown material.
"We tried to work with secondary materials," explains йоп трауборст, project manager, who is representing the community спейкениссе, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single agricultural enterprise in фрисландии we met an agricultural byproduct.
For many years in the fields and greenhouses in the Netherlands as the lining the roots used artificial fibrous material millimeter thickness.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textile serves one or two of the season, then he can throw.
For the library this painting - for the first time in such quantities - was спрессовано four centimeters in thickness panel.
Under the heat and pressure of the so-called ландбаупластик (klp) turns into a dark, monolithic, durable material, by means of their smell a bit like a new car and a little bit sneakers.
At the top are 105 stages.
Whoever breaks the path of almost 500 meters in length, will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only fantastic views of the city, but also Dutch крокетами and tree фикусами in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and in the first place to correct the air humidity on literary Hill.
The cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite a lot of glass surfaces, represents a model project in terms of the environment," says троуборст.
The heat is used for its heating and cooling of the Earth.
Although Gore's book is under glass entered, even on clear days the sun hits in only for a short period of time.
Vast farms of клееной wood, located virtually perpendicular to the facade, provide shade and take upon themselves the bulk of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very nice.
The protection offer fully automatic roller curtains.
Stefan спермон mentioned above skeptic of IT sector, has already visited the new library.
Лизетте верхайг also were already here.
As well as traditional Chinese medicine преподавательница Cynthia богард, which called the "soul спейкениссе букенберг, which has long lacked."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to a book from their own meetings.
These books were supposed to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully consisting of library - at the time it was delivering books.
The idea worked.
Shelves заставлены to the top.
"There is nothing worse than полупустая library," says the architect blame Maass.
"I think that now, thanks to our invitation, every citizen in some way connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is a part of the building.
Even if it is just for decoration.
Thus, km3 managed to solve a problem that the professional jargon called the creation of identity.
Спейкениссе wrote his literary history.
And even though they're very young and необразованны.
It is only the starting point for building identity.

Szabo said: "The Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained on the recognition of Palestine.
According to the Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on a diplomatic track.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that she will vote against the Palestinian bid to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in the Gaza Strip.
Germany now need to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think, that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not speaking too critical toward Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also abstained on the introduction of a forbidden zone for flights.
In the end, NATO has conducted this proposal.
Germany is hard to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely passes from politics, which, so to speak, by the United States, to the German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that the Europeans have no coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to this.
I believe that as long as they only нащупывают its role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, which hosts France or Britain.
What exactly is a "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
This willingness to hold the position in its national interest, not depends on the position of the United States or the European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, from exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests largely differ from those of other large states, and that is why Germany must defend its interests.
Whether these economic interests contributed to a position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Gulf states.
Therefore, she should be careful not to offend the public and elite in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn't give it too much importance, it is not entirely one-way communication.
But in any case it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans.
Навредила whether Germany to its relations with the United States, refraining when making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States has an understanding of the German position.
So I don't think that it was the same dramatic надлом, as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even thus gained a certain respect.
It signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international stage and that with its interests should be considered.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, by contrast, clearly voted veto.
There is a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
On the strength of American domestic policy such differences existed forever.
I believe that the Obama administration has sufficient understanding of the European position in the depths of the soul.
But the government in connection with the local political situation, of course, cannot take such a position openly.
I believe that significant differences in opinion is not so significant, as always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama may not be out of place in a delight from Netanyahu's policies.
If Germany can combine their ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the most important partner in the European Union on the other?
I think that this is a difficult situation for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier if there was one, непротиворечивая European policy, but now it is not.
That is why they cannot act within the framework of a more broad-based approach and forced to act instead relying only on their own vision of the situation.
So they come with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take the lead role in the development of a common European position.
It's clear that it's difficult for Germany, if only because of ties with Israel.
This issue has always been embarrassing.
But I think the Germans clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player - don't take it upon myself really the main role?
Or a leading role still difficult given Germany?
Germany is not yet accustomed to it, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, so far, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - each time, when Germany assumes an important role, are very different German feelings.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
In fact, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It should take into account a variety of opinions and neighbors, and it is not easy.
So far, the U.S. influence in European politics continuously weakens, but at the moment the EU not fills the vacuum, who then left?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if you don't like, unpleasant or reinforces the enmity to you - such is life!

"trademark protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is world famous trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is it Armani polo?
It is officially registered the name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed.
Yet it will be protected until the owners of the original names not be sued.
But it is unclear whether they assert their rights.
"Foreigners is becoming increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," says the company's lawyer, Thomas паттлох Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights violations on trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears in a case of this kind.
Имитаторам enough to add just a few letters, to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci is Lu-you can register instead Prada, Gucci, Prada-kny.
The same way legally copied German enterprises, for example, sporting goods maker Puma.
Паттлох opens the folder with records of trademark registration offices in Beijing.
September 14, 2010 the company recorded a trade mark there Zegna DF Puma, artificial name, in which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are the champions of the world copied and violation of intellectual property rights, is well known.
In big cities have many department stores, selling almost exclusively forgery.
But no such case паттлоха. On behalf of their delegants he opposed to Chinese companies is officially received from the agency the right to use the name, trademark registration, which already is somewhere else.
The Chinese call this "ban минпай," Mark-passenger.
This word is associated with "дакуань ban."
So are women, who are hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not recognize the blame
"This damages the business, with the need to fight," паттлох believes.
"trademark pointed, a unique position is lost, the image suffer very much."
The procedural costs in the affected industries and financial losses calculated by the millions, especially in the case of expensive копируемых products.
According to the company's sales volume of 15 billion euros per year with market research at CLSA, China is the third largest and the fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
However, it's difficult to achieve the removal of dubious records in the register of trade marks, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Паттлох tells about cases in which the court declined claims, because after a long time опротестованное title was "a reality of the market."
If a complainant is lucky, he will even must pay плагиатору, as did the damage his trade to the mark in China, says паттлох.
Sometimes it is the law of the jungle.
There is also a famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009 the company Daimler lost a dispute with construction machinery maker Sany, Enterprise, which just before a firm-maker Putzmeister бетононасосов.
So the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the Mercedes star.
Купившая Volvo, Geely originally used blue-and-white logo, experiencing BMW; the process was a success, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion goods advertised lost in China имитаторам from Hong Kong and Singapore, have celebrated the crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities did not consider himself guilty.
The trademark office ctmo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to a lack of staff and equipment premises there occurred difficulties.
But in the past year was "a return to normal from an emergency situation in the process."
So, the number of objections of raw cases decreased by 22 percent.
It closed almost 57.000 such cases, by as much as 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still waiting for the production of the FBI.
To deal with this is expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year in ctmo received more than 1.4 million applications on the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This means that China and the record for the tenth time in a row, led the list of new registrations worldwide, according to the office.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011 was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees.
If simplify, this means that each check worth an average of 160 euros or 1280 yuan.
Contest its worth many times more, as it shows a German family enterprise Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the group is struggling against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans were able to ensure that the illegal manufacture them fake auto parts was gone.
But simulation secured a Chinese trademark rights Freudenberg.
It was an oversight, as well as the names of their own in Germany are not subject to the protection, says ханно вентцлер, chairman of the board of the chemical Freudenberg specialities in Munich.
And the office registered trademarks ctmo rejected pretension мюнхенцев.
However, in both instances following Freudenberg won, but the other party continues to struggle so far.
To be on the alert
Now the question is pending in the Supreme Court.
Вентцлер hopes to bring the case to a conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also said: "The process is extremely expensive and robs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs barely to archive and accounting firms to review even acts a hundred years old, to give evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg inconclusively suggested the adverse party "greater шестизначную amount in Euro" for a settlement.
"It is clear, however, how much it costs us," says вентцлер.
The danger of the Far East to infect even in Europe.
But just in case, if decoys register there for an unprotected trademarks.
For example, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this could prevent the registration.
"We need to be vigilant," вентцлер says.
Both he and the lawyer паттлох recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather than foreigners should "all that is in any way to protect, register as well as in China," says вентцлер.
Otherwise it can do much more than check.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his drama about a trade mark, it will have to pay the adverse party licensing fees for its own name, explains вентцлер.
Otherwise we supplant in contested segment of the market.

World AIDS Day: притоптывать, sing, help
In the choir rehearses хайдельберге имбонги - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice this.
The story of the relationship, and the distance more 8733 kilometers.
First blasts притопывание: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, men's and women's pumps drop your slippers pick a cycle on паркетном floor and quickly find him.
Times-two-three-four.
Only after that slowly develop the voices of the singers - alto, tenor, soprano and bass - they occur, fascinating and follow each other.
And фите хопф, a 29-year-old conductor, nearly stumbled from their people shoes, when leading their flexible and their gestures.
Monday evening, the music hall at the Institute of medical psychology at хайдельберге имбонги choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty came at a rehearsal of the choir members from 23 to 69 years old, from специалистки on human genetics to contributions.
"Om обани" is not an easy thing, every voice choir has its own text, in addition to completely чуждом language: зулусском, spoken eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and Swaziland in some parts.
Self-help
In the world according to the evaluation of UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on AIDS, there are an estimated 34 million HIV-infected people.
23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa.
Living in Swaziland 245 000 orphans of AIDS.
At the same time more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 orphans of AIDS in the village эситжени combining voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
About 70 of them attend school, готовящую for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros per month can assume шефство.
It guarantees the money for school children, school uniforms, and a daily hot lunch in the Gogo-center.
The имбонги зулусском language means the narrator or восхвалитель.
In this hall does not speak fluent in the Bantu, but can sing.
Nearly ten years choir разучивает songs on this strange soft language and occasionally even brings them back to where they appeared for the first time: in South Africa.
It is at a distance 8733 kilometers of the summer from хайдельберга, is located on the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, a village эситжени, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some of them still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus ич.
In эситжени in miniature mirrored the disease only Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the average life expectancy is the lowest in the world, according to UNICEF.
The circumcision of males, which доказанно reduces the risk of infection by half, among the population almost never made.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland is a death in the middle of the fourth dozen immunodeficiency virus is not uncommon.
The choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but first имбогни participants saw many children in the streets, which not only parental care, but simply lacked the: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling a man in a poor country have no chance at all.
At first it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school, and give him the opportunity, once a day to get a hot meal.
But already a year later choir founded the "voices for Africa," which since almost professional care for orphans of AIDS in эситжени.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important diseases, sexually transmitted?
The bacterial STDs syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia and триппер (are).
Frequent viral infections are the HIV-virus spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Лобковый педикулез and scabies treat паразитарным STIs.
What are the main поражаемые group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are mostly men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute stems from the fact that at least in four out of every five cases of syphilis, registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between the men.
The heterosexual adults often frequent STDs are хламидийные infection, трихомониаз, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhoea and human virus spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults have relatively low - but this group accounts for about 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Among the youth хламидийные infections are significantly more often than among other groups.
According to the sources, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We have among young people also often meets human virus spreading papillomas as characteristic of the disease.
As the number of cases of infection is changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007 declines.
There have been some 2,700 cases in 2011.
It is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate венерическое disease?
With infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, the complaint under мочеиспускании, selection, pain at the bottom of the stomach, as well as the bubbles or thickening.
But often they are not from headaches and other symptoms and go undetected.
How can you protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but did not provide absolute protection.
Partly because of sexually transmitted diseases, the bacteria can be spread by contact infection and in close physical contact.
So experts recommend regular screening, especially with frequent change sexual partners.
With early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote consequences.
Шефство, donations, and last but not least, fees for the choir performances across Germany allow something together.
"All we sent in эситжени already nearly 200,000 euros," says аннете леннартц, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany disposes цодва дламини, conscious and an active woman.
She also cares about orphans were well organised, for example, has one of the grannies.
Гогос, as called for зулусском older women, it is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to yourself up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over his head and care about the children appeared in the form of time each day in the classroom.
Those who never left home, arrive at the shelter to ханийсиле, a lonely woman, receiving a salary from the association, as well as two поварихи that each day preparing for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the "voices for Africa" organized Sewing School, built two henhouse and jointly with the American Health Organization PSI organized surrender analysis for HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is evident throughout the country, prefer deep silence.
The king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says аннете леннартц, "because he has to do with sexuality."
Unusually for the country, in which the King has officially 14 wives.
Black Africa's last absolute monarch, King мсвати III, known for its love of the largesse.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, at a Chinese state-style of life also blame for what ич virus spread so rapidly in recent years.
But it is also the stray workers who carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, аннете леннартц says, "but they almost never use.
Another culture - flesh to flesh. "
In order to maintain a bit of cultural exchanges, the choir ибмогни every two to three years is making the trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, confidence, morale and black identity that many on the southern edge of the black continent know yet since the days of apartheid.
A bus full of White, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even that happened, provoked tears in his eyes the border guards.
The trip is always the эситжени, where singers visit sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village with difficulty can be found on the map, in the Valley of the river эцулвени more than she is known.
"Go in эситжени, there's a light," the people here say.
But after kilometer-8733 flight back in Heidelberg, when топающие singers return in a room on the street бергхаймер, you can see that this light burns also here.

Liveperson: NASA opens up the ice on Mercury
The probe "liveperson found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can have the thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US space agency NASA proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also ice water, according to three studies, published Thursday in the journal Science.
The probe "liveperson found evidence that the region is located in the shadow of the planet covered with ice.
Its thickness must be at least 30 centimeters, or perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or, perhaps, the asteroid, facing the Mercury.
No one sees the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, "said Supervisor Sean Solomon probe.
The temperature at Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how the water and other building elements of life were in other places of the solar system.
Unbeknown to the probes, small robots and telescopes on Earth, for example, Phoenix, exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they sent to Earth images: small окошки in endless Dali.
The image comes from a camera, developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight of the planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which turns around the sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, according to a new definition of the International Astronomical Union in 2006, is not a "planet."
This infrared image fragment the Spitzer telescope is "family portrait" countless generations of stars: the old stars in the form of blue points, to identify the starry circle pink newborn stars.
This region звездообразования - scientists неромантично called his W5 - opened the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years away.

Of course, with the telescope colors are better.

It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
The similarity with the continent has brought this nebula nickname "North America."
The combination of the normal and infrared photography provides emphatic reproduction.
This new star in the beauty managed to photograph only with the help of the Spitzer telescope infrared sensors.
Saturn and its rings: as they emerged - one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it's pieces of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear images of the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color pictures spiral galaxies into real art works.
Published by the European Southern Observatory photograph shows трифид deleted on several thousand light years from Earth in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name comes from the Latin word трифид trifidus (трехдольный, трехраздельный), as well as the dark streaks of dust divide into three parts of a red-hot spirit into the heart of the cradle of stars.
In formation astronomers photographed a harbinger of space collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth two nuclei merging galaxies blow towards each other and inevitably collide.
It took the Hubble telescope, the birth of stars in a spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical cuts, can call it nicknamed the "Southern цевочное wheel."
A photograph of the Space Telescope Hubble shows a fragment of Iris Nebula in the constellation цефея.
The nebula, remote at 1400 light-years, is composed of particles of dust, the size of which from 10 to 100 times less than the typical household dust.
This image was composed of optical and X images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote at 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called ARP 273 photographed for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call a large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula star is the bright group of new stars of the Milky Way.
Star is constantly creates new stars.
This stellar cloud, United with туманностью socket, also constantly creates new stars - at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly illuminated the galaxy with a small black hole is not the only gas, dust.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the big bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably the telescope was invented in 1608, Hans липперсгеем - before Galileo a year later began monitoring the stars.
Since the mirror optical telescopes became more and more - and their view of the space available deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, "хале in паломар Observatory telescope in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, photographed here, has a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the US, installed a "large telescope бинокулярный."
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Grand телескопио канариас" has a giant inner workings - diameter mirrors alone accounts for 10.4 meters.
The Mirror "big South African telescope" in South Africa сегментировано - in order to cut costs.
Nevertheless it reaches about 11 meters in diameter.
The lack of constructive inexpensive execution: telescope rigidly 37th at a vertical angle is limiting his mobility.
The telescope "Hobby-эберли" in Texas also has a vertical angle.
His feature: high светособирающая ability.
She reaches - despite a relatively small diameter mirrors - the world's major telescopes parameters.
Using radio telescopes in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, the researchers listen to whatever signals in space.
Christoph has a diameter of 305 meters.
Participating in the project "The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help, giving her the processing power.
Look at the European Astronomy Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
There is "a very large telescope" fully corresponds to its name.
His four mirrors to cover the visual tunnel even average infrared spectrum.
The Chilean Observatory ESO also plans to set up a European "very large telescope."
Its main mirror should раскинуться by as much as 42 feet - and will be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But don't expect the photos before 2018.
Until 2007, both the Keck telescope in Hawaii, a volcano Mauna кеа were the largest in the world.
There are two mirrors at 10 meters in diameter.
The Keck telescopes belong to the Observatory on Mauna-кеа, which along with them is also looking into the sky with telescopes "Subaru and irttf.
In addition, must be a giant telescope on Mauna-кеа - with a mirror with a diameter of three meters.
Here they can admire the illustrations.
But the most important species from space provides the space telescope Hubble.
On April 24, 1990, he delivers a picture of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope "Kepler searches for planets outside the solar system - especially those for whom life is possible.
February 2, 2011 NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets have been discovered since the beginning of the mission.
The photos feature the Kepler space telescope "cooking."
The space telescope James Webb's brusque words (JWST) will not be sent into space before 2018 aboard rocket Ariane 5. "
The main mirror the infrared space telescope with a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: he must seek a large explosion in the light of the first stars and galaxies.
The scientists suggest that there is ice on the south pole of mercury.
But there is no reliable data about this, as well as "liveperson moves closer to the north pole on the planet.

The trip through the mountains талышские can be called wild and romantic.
A minibus with громыханием rolls on winding road past overgrown dense forest Hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is green and bright, you can think that, if you are in шварцвальде.
But it is the most southern region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers away.
Here are the talishs - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, is only what they say in Farsi and азербайжданском and different долголетием.
The final paragraph is лерик.
A small town flaunts too ponderous architecture of the Soviet era, which does not attuned to the scenic mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost never come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku too утомительна.

Legendary wealth, which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here in the province, have not yet.
But Pilate фатулаева (48) is convinced that there is a лерике than attract tourists.

At the age of 136 years he has another child was born
But the controversial star Museum is Shepherd ширали мюслюмов, which allegedly was 168 years old.
Birth certificates, however, no.
As the oldest man, whose age was confirmed the documents, 122 years old, an age мюслюмова seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in 1805 in this area, died in 1973," explains фатулаева.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, aged 136 years he has allegedly born daughter.
So whether Shepherd added мюслюмов a couple dozen years to their age?
Even Rembrandt solc, a researcher of the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about долгожителях in Central Asia.
"A surprising number of elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Valley хунза in Pakistan," said solc, "on Sardinia also lives very many very old people."
But because of the lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, because there wasn't the civil status registers.
Every day the glass baked butter
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the district лерика strikingly often reach biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years old.
Why here in the South, so many livers?
Azerbaijan the guide explains Farid мугимзаде this particular genes Talyshs.
Museum director фатулаева, on the contrary, believes that the nutrition.
The talishs like bread, meat and dairy products, many of them drinking on стакану baked oil every day. However unlikely such высококалорийная diets can be healthy with диетологической standpoint.

The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful "of the Muslim Brotherhood."
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he was temporarily cut the competence of the constitutional court and expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61-year-old engineer with a degree of Doctor of the American University of Southern California, not quite clear Egyptians and around the world.
Lee will be deprived of the judiciary forces?
In fact 234 articles managed to get in a 15-hour night seen steeplechase on Islamic configured the constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and it partly raises concerns.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judicial system is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does it mean to "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and may fear that Islamists will use blurred the wording and arising in connection with her legal backlash to a strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least on this suggests one нововведенная article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, should draw for the Council of the University of al-ашар, critical of the country's Islamist institution, notoriously highly regarded throughout the Sunni Islam.
This could mean that the clergy, but should not надзирает for legislation that would de facto produce the restriction of the judiciary.
The draft constitution is a lot of interpretation
Another problem: should preserve venue of civilians in military courts.
These courts during the Mubarak government served for the suppression of the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is so vague that public institutions with the help of this article will be able to control the content of the film and literature.
Open text that is nothing more than censorship.
No one shall not set right the equality of men and women.
But another prohibits insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Questionable also appears to be the wording that bans "insulting people."
Enough is critical to the president or jokes about правоведа?
The question of interpretation, like many things in this project, which Morsi offers on the signature and who, in his words, "very soon" Egyptians will be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For a few weeks already formed the opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual consensus on the evening of Friday in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we'll win," said хамдин саббахи, took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel peace laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said that a draft constitution place "on the scrapheap of history."
He accused Morsi's supporters through Twitter, the short news service in a desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares a referendum, we go to his palace and скинем him," said oppositionist яссер said.
"We have not tired yet отмщена, the blood of our brothers," Khaled Ali quoted Egyptian opposition media policy.
Many judges also reported that do not want to watch the referendum that would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution."
Well-organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under покрывалами and Salafi supporters, who shouted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
They demanded Morsi: "очисти country!" and assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The power struggle over символичной Square, on which all began, triggered a near civil war.
Morsi's followers, quite clearly, didn't want to go to this risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution was loud and clear.
Now the time has come to let the people decide the election ballot, in which direction the country should go.
The Islamists, the majority for the project, it is considered to be have been a done deal.
"The notion of" human rights "are not mentioned anywhere"
Hafiz Abu саеда furious that forced the constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (еопр) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when they sat in jail under Mubarak or brought before the court.
Because human rights for him, not because he shared their worldview is inviolable.
For this, he was beaten, jailed, arrested.
But now the words "human rights" did not appear in the new constitution, regrets it in an interview with the Welt am Sonntag. "
Morsi's expanding influence on all three branches of power in the state earlier lawyer.
These measures represent crushing blows to the democratic rules of the game and the Egyptians would lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of trying to strengthen the civilian government, President de facto annulled his" regrets саеда.
Because without civil society organizations democracy cannot function.
Саеда feels that it left him, even to the international community, which looks at the ideological battle lines on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
Because it can be granted.
Protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster cannot control."

The Norwegian ракфиск: most badly smelling of flower fish in the world?
Norway's population пятимиллионного has one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe but also around the world.
Perhaps the secret of success in this country is somehow related to the local addiction to one extremely зловонному рыбному mixed?
Take a few перезревших pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and steaming sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You get отшибающий smell the odor ракфиска - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called фагернес, in three hours drive from Oslo.
Around covered with snow scenic views. "It's very nice, but in the air разлит неистребимый distinctive smell.
Ракфиск is Trout, посыпанная бродившая and salt in the water to a year, depending on how you present it to achieve.
As the Norwegians gather холодает and Twilight, crowds gather at the festival in the фагернесе devoted to this day, for example, offer mixed.
"eat it raw and запивают рюмкой аквавита, local тминной vodka," explains Howard хальварсен, a local firefighter by profession and a "general ракфисковый" Spider-Man, who runs the festival.
All around us people eat presliced small diced fish and запивают her немалыми amounts of alcohol.
"Someone like аквавит, than ракфиск," Howard said.
This drink is to top the smell.
I try a couple pieces.
If we manage to convey a lump under her nose, it's not so bad - little differs from portions of land, you long charge with them on the bus.
Ракфиск is the product of an entirely different nature of the times, the Times of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the autumn замачивали in non closed flanks with salt water.
Then deep in the winter, when the fish are already well and thoroughly забродила, her извлекали приглушив perception, alcohol consumed in food.
Even on the memory of the previous generation of the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to flee their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly -- more than 13 percent are immigrants who are here jobs, higher wages and developed the social security system.
Residents of Sweden (longstanding rival, and yet not so long ago and far more wealthy neighbor) mass come here to work.
Ракфиск is seen as an important symbol, having, though several foul element of the past Norway.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, there are expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs you at 9 pounds ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the News of the world, and the majority of the country's population, it seems to be just fine.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name Anders Breivik, last year, a racist and an extremist right-расстрелявшего and killing 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, called the attack "happened on July 22."
Норвежцам very difficult to believe that one of their fellow citizens in their peaceful country was capable of such atrocities and killings.
At the heart of today's prosperity lies in Norway (growth since the early 1970s) is one of the largest oil and gas fields in the world.
"However, the oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," says Anna, our waitress, разносящая trays with; ракфиском, a woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare.
We as a people, as you call it, contemplative.
Like most Norwegians, she says in English.
We don't like doing the show, we don't хвастливы.
Norway very carefully drawn from its oil is a big part of the revenues of the oil and gas industry invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when all сорили money, which they have not been, Norway employee подсчитывала all costs.
"As long as you can go to movies in the summer, and skiing in the winter, this is enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there are ракфиск," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow in the queue for any food - ракфиска enough with me.
Here's a hamburger with лосиным meat is certainly exoticism, tasty сочное meat.
But the evening awaits us more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel hold a special dinner, dedicated ракфиск, during which visitors vote to determine the best or, perhaps, most ароматную fish.
Goes straight телеэфир, in which show a bow-tie, roped plates with ракфиском.
It seems the Eurovision song contest.
"So, Tor-Jurgen, some of you have the best fish there at home in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment"
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falls from a seat, perhaps, перебрав аквавита.
Or perhaps just надышавшись smell the fish.

The Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start careers.
As long as Mexico's new president Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join in the post, BBC correspondent will grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face, and the mixed expectations of his country's population.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly deplorable condition.
This city is saturated transportation and steel fences were erected in the best time, and on Monday, перерезавшие several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not in order not to let people get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protests from falling to the parliament building.
On Sunday the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto puts the presidential перевязь and will take the reins of the country.
Before him is not an easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderon, who now pulls its powers, but the country mired in the war on drugs, which for six years has claimed some 60,000 lives.
"My government claims to the Mexican people about their willingness to deal with violence," said earlier this week Mr Peña Nieto US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements by the president of the United States the political career of Mr Peña Nieto evolved as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his homeland, in густонаселенном and opinions about the new leader, the vast state surrounding the capital of a country divided.
The outspoken man
In the idyllic town Valle de Bravo, for example, about him fondly remembered.
Residents put him in for the revival of tourism, the resort industry and infrastructure development.
Before the city could get through one of the new highway, built Mr. Peña Nieto, the Nam, which differs from the roads with выбоинами and pits that were previously at this place.
A placard with his name hangs on a modern building sports center and the blockbuster interactive museum devoted to climate change.
"We associate with him hope of real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally ольвера Gabriel Hernandez, a congresswoman from upstate New York led by Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change that our country so desperately needed, primarily in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party was relegated in 2000 to Vicente Fox.
Congressman ольвера admits that after his 12-year absence in the presidential palace of Los пинос party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes accusations бессодержательности, who introduced the new president of the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very devoted to the cause of his vision of the future of the country.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man who listen.
But in another part of the state's many people have had a different view of former have.
The municipality несауалькойотль, also known under the name of Ciudad-support, poses the most stark contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under эстакадами highways, in many ways, he is a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality also wear dour character of this metropolis.
Earlier this year to restrain gangs, drug trading in these areas, the troops were involved; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
The lake near the vast landfill only a few dozen bodies were discovered over the past two years killed the women.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico during губернаторства Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar measure in the violent city of Ciudad-Wednesday, whose name became infamous прославившемся нарицательным, when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto, about him in the best-case scenario, we can say that during his tenure as governor, he could not cope with the problem of the killings of women.
In the worst case, if his administration accused completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of the concrete house, like most of the houses in the area until this year, иринея буэндия barely halts tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter марианы moon.
According to the official version Mariana in 2010, committed suicide.
Her family, however, thinks that she killed her сожитель.
"When I reached her home, it seems that her body was washed before this," Ms. буэндия recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and his body already окоченело.
The mother марианы tells this story, and a portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs around with rings, on which written just one word: Justice.
This, they said, was denied this family.
"state officials appealed to me, as with the old сплетницей upset нарушительницей tranquility.
They want people simply have to believe what they say, and помалкивали.
But it is wrong, it can't be, particularly when around so many shortcomings and violations, "she says.
A presidential перевязь on Saturday, president of Peña Nieto, together with her to assume major responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families in Mexico over the past six years have affected the crimes associated with violence, and the new president promised to solve this problem a priority during his reign.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same as the president, as the governor was," says ольвера, Congressman from Valle de Bravo PRI.
But this fear most families of victims in Ciudad-support.

Bradley Manning not complained mistreatment, the indictment claims.
Prosecutors are trying to refute claims Bradley мэннинга about poor conditions of detention.
During the hearing, special attention was paid to мэннинга stay in a military prison in Virginia квантико.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the conditions of detention мэннинга were brutal.
The US Army private accused of the abduction of several thousands of secret documents.
On Friday the prosecution tried to show that the average Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in American history, is used in a variety of opportunities to file a complaint to the mistreatment, which, in his words, he had transferred, while in the military prison.
During cross-examination by J hearing at Fort, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maryland, a military prosecutor major эшден Fein said record weekly visits мэннинга representatives of the administration of the prison for the first nine months of his detention in квантико, Virginia, do not contain complaints of mistreatment.
Cross-examine him under the claim of protecting termination proceedings мэннинга on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and themselves were sufficient punishment, was held on the next day after Manning said that while in detention, he intended to commit suicide.
A military expert analysis of intelligence data, arrested in June 2010, is charged with the abduction of several thousands of secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the internet by WikiLeaks.
The WikiLeaks not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
During the hearing Friday attorney Fein together with мэннингом looked at the reports, which were after visits мэннинга квантико administration officials during his stay in prison, where he was on a strict regime prison from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to the prison officials asked мэннингу questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor Fein asked Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that the appeal to himself from the administration of the prison as "excellent," and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
Reviewed reports do not contain allegations of the mistreatment, despite the fact that мэннинга directly asked about the conditions of his detention, says Fein.
Manning said he expressed concern about these problems, and that his посещавшие oral administration officials discussed these issues with him and have stated that they will, but not фиксировали this in writing.
"They had" no problems "(after), but it doesn't mean that I don't discuss my complaints raised this issue in a conversation," Manning said.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked мэннинга, why he had not complained of ill-treatment with him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission, рассматривавшей suicidal intentions, which he expressed in writing for several months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to achieve with his shot mode "prevention of injury" and softened the terms and conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited the detention regime - at a level lower than the supervision regime with the aim of preventing suicide - was introduced for the protection of the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the security of others.
"I wanted to know the administration, that is all right with me, so they canceled the regime of injury prevention... to improved the quality of my life, from my point of view," Manning said.
On Thursday Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and translation in Kuwait, where he held for nearly two months, before he was transferred to the prison at the naval base in квантико, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that thinking about suicide appeared with him in Kuwait, and that once he lost consciousness due to intense heat.
He explained that psychologically very hard, when you don't have to know, how is your fate, and that's what's going on in the outside world.
"My world сжался to base camp арифжан, until the size of my life in prison," Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
While in квантико, Manning, in his words, spent most of the time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in solitude.
Manning said that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and sunglasses.
He says that tried to move, so as to sleep or even just lie in the daytime ban rules.
According to мэннинга during sleep in the eyes of him constantly beat the light, civilian outside of the camera.
If the guards didn't see his face, when he переворачивался in bed at night, then, in his words, his arousing and were forced to turn on the back.
The lawyer мэннинга filed a formal objection over illegal treatment with мэннингом in January 2011.
In April 2011 мэннинга transferred to a military prison in Fort ливенворт, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned мэннинга about the statement, which he made at the time of testimony on Thursday, saying that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at квантико, forced him to stand naked in front of other prisoners and the guards during the morning checking.
Manning said he had not been allowed to cover a blanket during inspections.
Answering questions judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the Guard command that should throw a blanket, which could прикрываться, but conceded that nobody directly ordered him to leave him.
Manning said on Thursday that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempts to show the officer that he poses no danger to themselves.
Manning said that officer said that could use gum shorts and slippers, to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to мэннинга, his underwear, slippers and points away from the camera.
His lawyers hope the judge would, at least, is what he experienced while in detention, and significantly reduce the sentence, if Manning is convicted by a military court, which is expected to begin consideration of his case at the beginning of next year.
The defense said that plans to offer мэннингу admit guilt for lesser crimes, as well as other charges challenge as excessive.
A hearing is scheduled for this weekend, the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention were acquitted.
The Pentagon argues that Manning was held in maximum квантико in accordance with the rules governing the content of those arrested with strict regime.
Among his indictment мэннингу, are aiding the enemy, illegal to facilitate the transfer of information relating to the national defense, and the kidnapping of public property or records, the publication of data on the Internet.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.

My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican descent.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize their potential.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country's tough times.
Ruben наваретте believes that Mexican American descent torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked along the corridor for arrivals, approached the border zone and remained in place.
Signs point to two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood for a few seconds before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was Mexican.
It's just a name, just as my friends in Boston call themselves Irishmen, and friends from New York feel Italians.
Later, I stopped at the complex structure of "an American of Mexican descent.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here at the birthplace of my grandfather, had no need for conventional names or intricate designs.
I was just an American.
I speak in Spanish well enough to ask questions or to respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than the tongue, and I can't get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled my American passport and was in line for extranjeros.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when Mexico's newly elected President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were usual for meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto president willingly talked about the rise of the Mexican economy, in which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will remain in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and establish a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto, the president promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but did not mention any specific proposals.
For Mexico's relations with the United States is heavy and full of old grievances question.
Most Americans have never thought about the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and under дулом rifles forced its leaders to give up half of its territory.
But the Mexicans have for centuries, rather than minutes, and see reminders of those events around.
Why should only any statesman us обмолвиться any word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite Mexican society immediately given complain that the Americans impinge on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma преисполняются militancy.
At the same time Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States are the most complex.
If you want to talk about insults?
It is enough for them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves, and those for whom there are no such opportunities in this country.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point their family history anyone - a father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to realize ourselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Often they were Mexicans, a certain type of "смуглые малообразованные, from a poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we forget about it.
In Mexico see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and boarded the good work, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination запутано and is unclear, but we know which country considered his.
The United States of America.
At the same time, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class does not like us.
We respond to them in the same way.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second-class people like to ненастоящим Mexicans.
We are not enough good talk in Spanish, and our relations with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence for them because of failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We don't have it now for a silk curtain, сытую life found in the United States, but lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a kid, and it reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexican origin is a shame.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time the Americans of Mexican descent, many of my friends do not feel any belonging to one of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but Love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico, we Americans.
But in the U.S. we are Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during her trip, like our relationship without the muddled enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican descent were kind of ambassadors in Mexico and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell his fellow Americans about what is a beautiful country and how great her visit, and could persuade political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
Nothing will come out of it.
Too much offense in the past.
But given the gap between rich and poor, corruption and drug binge, many of us do not believe this country is very beautiful.
Sorry, but out of this themselves, амигос.
And rightly so.
If part of Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States the way they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Americans of Mexican descent were still in it for him, as he recently did with their relatives in Mexico.
Yes.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.

The old battle in the new Middle East
The ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Lee is possible long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
The next round of bloodshed leads to a conclusion about the futility of such hopes.
Sound, as usual, meaningless disputes about who started first; many buildings turned into ruins, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time during the conflict, released from the territory of Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians hopelessly bogged down in his извечном change came to the conflict in the Middle East.
To this can be treated differently, but the events of the Arab Spring "in the rebellious закружили storm many established realities, the Israelis and the Palestinians failed to stay away from the vortex, потрясшего region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than previously.
But there are reasons, giving hope for an exit from this deadly impasse.
The war without winners
At first glance, the present situation gives no reason for optimism.
Even if a cease-fire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be carried out, that this week's clashes only strengthened security on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will from the fact that they forced Israel to retreat, despite incurred losses.
Despite the fact that some gang leaders were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most populous and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact Hamas intensified its popularity on the west bank of the Jordan River - another Palestinian territory, currently controlled more moderate Fatah.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working against them.
As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas and more influential and wealthy friends.
Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, performed with the support of Hamas, one of the wealthiest and fastest growing states of the Persian Gulf, Qatar followed suit.
Торжествующие Hamas supporters claim about creating the Islamic crescent around Israel from Lebanon in the north, in which governs the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which all the more происламистские rebels overthrew the rule of President Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where the king's power is threatened by the allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred in the most populated areas on the southern borders of Israel and an Arab country, in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not уделявшим special attention by Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, are the organization, largely similar with Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to populism.
In future diplomatic расстановках Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice cannot drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of a "tough" line in Israel come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel's "Iron Dome" missile system justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many running Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States has remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries also laid the blame for the start of the latest round of violence by Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Binyamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets, issued from the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, partly at the expense of the wall, which comes on the territory of the west bank of the Jordan River, a large part of the Palestinian state, and advocates Jewish settlements, which continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party is in preparation for a course on 22 January elections is reunited with even more violent conservatives led infrastructure Lieberman, very convenient.
What meaning to the Palestinians and give them their own country?
If put into their hands all power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will run from the rockets at Israel, as their brethren in Gaza do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempt to raise his head.
Perhaps the proponents of a "tough" line victorious; but their calculations can be proven wrong in the Arab Spring.
Though the Islamists, who came to power in Egypt and other countries that are not very warm feelings toward Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Defense part of the budget more than in all of its Arab neighbors, Israel's combined.
The outbreak of war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
The president of Egypt, Morsi, who worked together with Barack Obama pragmatism over ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As the democratic change in the Arab world, depriving the Palestinians' right to self-determination is a time bomb that sooner or later all hell breaks loose on the territories occupied by Israel, like House, взорванному in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population is only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operation, which are held every few years for the suppression of the Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip, must pay a growing discontent in the international community.
Both sides need external a pulse
Remains the only solution, to which tirelessly calling our newspaper and sensible representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world: the education of the two countries and territories in exchange for security concessions by Israel.
Hope, not too impressive in the short term, "the hope that a cease-fire would allow other countries more influence on both sides of the conflict.
Egypt, which it's time to take the decision to block the shipment of weapons to Gaza, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, a profitable position in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the Jewish state since 1967 borders with the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts towards reconciliation with Hamas and Fatah movements.
It would have made more than the forthcoming vote for the creation of a Palestinian state at the United Nations, the result of which may become a virtual statehood recognition of Palestine.
Should play a role in helping to bring Israel to the negotiating table, and President Obama.
During his first term, he has not presented a plan for a peaceful settlement of their own.
After returning to the White House, he still shows an unwillingness to connect the solution to this problem.
So disastrously недальновидная position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

The law came into force in Australia about unified packaging for cigarettes.
The images and warnings about the hazards of smoking affected parts of the body's disease in contrast are on a damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law on a package of cigarettes and tobacco-type entered into force, replacing logos and color of different brands of the same transmission glum-olive color with nasty snapshot of the images of the children and the affected parts of the body, whose health has been decimated their parents' smoking.
Apart from different backgrounds and inscriptions, warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between wads, introduced in a compulsory manner with this Saturday - the name brands, which published the same fine print.
This is the most severe in the world in terms of packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia said that the purpose of this action is to deter young people from smoking, depriving drop the habit of fashionable status.
The basis for such a decision on the results of the research, unprecedented that people do not sign up to 26 years of smoking in 99 out of 100 cases never become smokers.
"Obviously, that even in very young children understand the sense that tobacco companies are trying to communicate with the help of packaging," explains the health minister Tanya плиберсек, citing studies, Pulp, which, for example, the crown in a logo is associated with children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest in the world of smokers, so that these changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of similar measures already view and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that it will only increase the share of the black market, in which will be available and cheap cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought his initiate," says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco companies in Australia.
The producers of counterfeit goods from China and Indonesia will supply more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone new laws, on the contrary, contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra ha from a small family company Zico import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone boxes, hides unpleasant images on the package, rapidly grew (virtually from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco and Philip Morris lost a case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to appeal against the law.
In the words of Sandra ha, Zico company already has about six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party.
For us, it is good business.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among just a part of the population that the aim of these measures.
After the adoption of a series of laws in Australia, made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support their sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers to cigarettes in plain sight, tobacco advertising shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government banned Web sites and local companies advertise on the network, but it cannot restrict foreign sites in this.
"If you sell tobacco and you have remained only this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet you seem very tempting," explains Beca Freeman, исследующая issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman said the growth in the number of reviews on trademarks, written on behalf of supposedly ordinary users, in social networking sites such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
The question is whether it is the ordinary citizen, who is so fond of Marlboro cigarettes that did not spare the time and effort and made the video, or is behind this advertising company?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco Company argues that the industry is more busy adaptation to the new rules, rather than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on measures such as sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for the challenge of the new rules: these states make claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was unfair restrictions, despite the fact that all these countries trade relations with Australia is very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya плиберсек, government обсуждало with other countries to make them similar laws on the packaging.
In 2001, Canada imposed the first mandatory posting photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The tightening of laws is seen in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia ostentatiously not obey innovation.
These pictures of me not graze.
I just don't pay attention.
"Just выхватываешь прячешь and cigarette pack in my pocket," said Victor Al Haig, buys cigarettes with a photo of the pack on the mouth tumors.
Frankly, this is the only thing that can make me quit my daughter.
James Yiu, head of King of the pack tobacco store in downtown Sydney, argues that the same packaging difficult job placement of goods on the shelves
"Before I had the unloading of the new party was an hour, and now four hours," he says.
"The government should have taken and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, OK, all over, close the shop," he says, вскидывая hands up.

Bored in the world of electronic networks and permanent connections - it's not so bad.
This Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our aircraft have revealed a mechanical problem and was replaced by another plane, which we and дожидались.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't kid you.
Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and there is not much help either books, magazines, or an iPhone or even shops up trade.
But in recent years, increasingly, scientists and experts on child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children here are not so bad.
This makes the brain distracted on interesting related topics that, perhaps, is the creative work.
And since everyone in the modern world, we are constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us.
Maybe we should strive to boredom?
Yes.
And, at the same time, no.
Still, we return to this.
Before I, like many others, believed that boredom is a relatively recent invention era, when people have more free time.
Not so, says Peter туи, professor of Greek and Roman Canadian history at the University of Calgary, author of the book "fascinating history of boredom" (boredom: a lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom boasts a very ancient history," he said.
On the walls in помпеях discovered Latin inscriptions of boredom, from the first century.
At the same time remains an open question, as we understand bores.
The problem is, "says John D. иствуд, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that vision and understanding of boredom often spins.
Studying the materials research on this topic and by Professor иствуд and his colleagues, the question of the target group in 100 people came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want but cannot do so, that would bring them the satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and апатией, he says, lies in the fact that скучающий man does not do something that would like to do.
Don't want nothing to do with apathy.
The experienced boredom, he says, is "a violation of the attention and associated with this worsening mood and feeling that time is slowly."
According to a description boredom can seem very similar to depression.
But Professor иствуд argues that despite a possible link between the two conditions, скучающие people see the causes of the problems in the outside world and circumstances, and in the Depression, people see a problem in itself.
Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we just find it difficult to concentrate on something.
In his study, "one reason: the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor иствуд with colleagues cite previously conducted an experiment, participants who listened to the recorded voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard loud noises are not relevant to the case of the programs included in the next room, others have heard these same sounds at a low volume, so that they could barely read, and a third group was only recorded voices without any sound track.
The participants, who heard a TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, more than any other - it was hard to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons and claimed that boredom.
When we are trying to focus attention on the difficult or compelling task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, said Mark J. фенске, associate professor of neurology at the University гвельфа, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something неинтересное, "for example, всматриваясь in search of marriage in the flow of the products in the pipeline, отвлекающая music can help avoid boredom."
He said that when people start покачиваться on a chair or paint a picture on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that, in fact, such actions simply cannot relax physically.
"The study showed that children who do not prohibit fidget and turn, learn better and запоминают more information than the children, from which require sit tight," says Professor фенске.
In some moments we all experience boredom: when flight delay (as in my case), monotonous speech listening, reading неинтересный film.
But different people have different degree inclination to boredom.
In the 1980s for measuring such individual features researchers have developed a special "a propensity to boredom."
The questions and statements are used to determine the assessment on such a scale, for example, "a lot of what I have to do, monotonous and unrelieved" or "me too much fun, so no matter what, do not have enough time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that скучают boys more than girls, "says Stephen воданович, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, particularly in the presence of external stimuli.
But on the whole the teenagers do often скучают.
In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted through пейджера nearly 400 teenagers and their parents with seven or eight times a day.
He received the following results: 32 percent of teens said they are bored at school and at the time of the homework, and 23 percent said they bored outside the school.
At the same time only 3 percent of the parents said that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he had no information about what would have been similar data about boredom, now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "in adolescence is the tendency of boredom," mainly because children and adolescents do not allow to fully resolve than they do.
Back to my original question: boredom useful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations of it, as studies show, can push people to the absurd and dangerous individual actions, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, "says Professor воданович, dedicated study of the problem more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that it should do something else; it is boredom," says Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
However, this same brain doesn't always knows what to do better.
If you are bored and you direct that energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
But if you're watching TV, you will get better soon for some time, and soon it will pass.
So, if your child bored and you give him the iPad, he will not be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom on their own or as any other way to manage their time and employment, "said Professor фенске.
"These skills and self-regulation that uses in a variety of situations," he said.
Your child learns not only to occupy myself something, he also learns self at all.
I don't think that bores need somehow praise.
However, you shouldn't think of her as something bad, too.
Rather it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor иствуд agree with that.
"We see it in such a way that we need more experience boredom with boredom is extremely unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact people are somehow disconnect from the permanent concerns and just relax.
"In the modern world, we have grown accustomed to constant over-stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when we way, silence and didn't know what to do."

It is unclear how the new law will apply for the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony ороско, девятнадцатилетний player the football team and the student community college in southeastern Colorado charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be entirely legitimate throughout the state, storing small portions of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.
Mr. ороско says that one day in September, he was with friends in ламаре and riding in a car on the prairies near the border with канзасом when police stopped them.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. ороско came agenda in court for drug possession and possession of the device for drug use - minor offences, each of which is due to a $100 fine and appointed a trial date.
"We are treated like criminals," says Mr ороско.
But if he was a criminal?
As a result of uncertainty, which lasts for several weeks after the Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small-scale trials depends not so much from the law but from the place of examination.
Marijuana-related charges for minor offences, are already in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.
Police stations already ceased to charge people in 21 years of age and older for possession of small doses that would be legitimate, as only a couple of weeks later, the law comes into force.
But in more conservative districts, Colorado prosecutors have decided to review the case, associated with marijuana, and still attract accountable for possession of the drug.
At the same time in some cities from Denver suburbs to the Mountain West vote for something, to prevent the emergence of new, state licensed stores in their places for the sale of marijuana.
"All this is growing so fast that I don't even know what to expect further," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora police chief in a small town in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in Washington state also озадачено почесывают heads.
They will formulate rules to determine the order of licensing cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done until December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in resolving issues at the beginning of the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"in Colorado and a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian Smith, a representative of the council to regulate the production and distribution of alcoholic products in Washington state.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, rather than put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent on which we could navigate," he says.
The bill of the state of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, and for an entire year, plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system is no more, and the right of possession of marijuana already узаконено.
But there's more complicated technical issues that must be resolved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state of "adequate access to licensed marijuana prohibition on trade with it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and day-care centers.
"particularly difficult will publish licensed marijuana trade enterprises in the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the recently established research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. "
November 21, a police chief Oates of Aurora sent his subordinates in an e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office will no longer attract persons under 21 years of age, accountable for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police stops уличать people in these violations "starting from this moment."
A police chief Oates said that the police would monitor compliance with the rules governing the activities of individuals in the city, BT marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug distributors.
The district attorney уэлд in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, represents a more rigorous approach to this issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that prosecutors will still be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly to encourage users of its people to undergo a course of treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, although many of them are accused of and other violations.
"The duty of our institutions - haunt for actions that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was controversial even in places like rural Mesa County, where voting members rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer draws to adult responsibility for possession of a small quantity of the drug.
The District Attorney Pete хаутцингер supported that decision, but also decided not to charge for already open cases involving the custody of marijuana.
"I believe that our direct responsibility to enforce the law until he will not change," he said.
Despite the fact that 55 percent of Colorado residents who took part in the voting, supported the inclusion of issues of the legal system and the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state, this decision will not be easy.
A controversial reaction of people in different locations across the state has ambiguity local authorities' attitude toward the state's experiment with marijuana.
"The district prosecutors on this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean макалистер денверский lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They sought for so long people for it, that it can't really come to terms with the fact that it is not a crime," he said.
Colorado and Washington, the United States, in which belong to a small number of marijuana as well as to alcohol is destined to become a pilot field throughout the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized trade, but at the same time they cautiously await instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to examine the cultivation and sale of marijuana as a federal crime.
Marijuana legalization supporters hope that the Justice Department will on this issue.
Despite several gained wide arrests of traffickers and patients, doing marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases made good on the trafficking of marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau for the fight against drugs will hardly rush home to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they will hardly turn a blind eye to the regulatory authorities of recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser to fight drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal government.
Even before the presidential election that some of the local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana and so could not open before next year.
Over the past week Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, raised on the six-ban on trade of marijuana, which apparently will be approved next week.
"We don't want to be in a position that we выдадим someone license, then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now there is a contradiction between the results of the local voting and those who voted for that state.
Still a lot of unresolved issues.

Петронелла уайэтт: I survived from Oxford for the fact that I'm a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views were not today.
How much I ever since I can remember, I always dreamed to do at Oxford University.
My father and elder brother described him as the best in the world, and studied at Oxford University, a modern equivalent antique symposium, закладывающий two foundations of civilization - dissidence and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the historical faculty вустерского College at Oxford University in the late 1980s, I gathered my bags and left, which led to the first real scandal in my life.
My father could not restrain himself and burst into tears.
The friends were hitting confusing.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I quit college, because I didn't like it, that my classmates have sex in the next room.
The writer ce Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from cups щербатых.
In fact, it is not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I systematically hounded and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied in a private school.
Hounded me for one reason only, and in this renowned cradle light it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow уайэтт, Margaret Thatcher was known as an advisor, and I myself was supported the Conservatives.
You ask, why reminiscing about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, rising center-right views, is subject to the same persecution.
This institutionalized and constantly growing hatred to students at Oxford-conservatives is so strong that last week, a group of students demanded the same kind of protection of their rights, such as the one is disabled, ethnic and sexual minorities.
The conservatives from the student club of Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say they "often actively isolate, expose personal attacked and forced feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to enter college of additional representative in the committee on equal rights, to ensure the freedom to express an opinion.
Their situation only worsened recently released on BBC Two documentary about politics in the student environment "country wonders: young, smart and the right wing," in which the Conservatives have eccentric and by neo-Nazi.
The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, who travels in Rolls-Royces, wears a silver suit and stick with silver набалдашником.
Students at other universities-conservatives complain of them are "scapegoats due to higher education fees."
Luke black, 20 years, vice-president of the Association of the conservative core of the university, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that "in a university environment increases skew toward the left.
We believe the people that we don't even know in advance of nerve and unpunished unruly children of wealthy parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history faculty of Corpus Christi College, in which had filed the petition on strengthening its security, calls this "неуютной" atmosphere, and Stephanie черилл, 19 years old, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club to match center-right views dramatically worsened.
"This represents a threat to the atmosphere of the intellectual debate, as well as for normal life just members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was the one.
I was there in September 1986, робкой and shy восемнадцатилетней girl.
Oxford лихорадило from hatred to the Conservative party.
For the year before university voting deprived former student Margaret Thatcher her an honorary degree because of budget cuts to higher education.
In such an atmosphere would be uncomfortable even сталинистам.
In the early days of the week freshmen, when students get to know each other with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time that awaited me in front of him.
I still didn't know that teachers not only looked through his fingers to poison themselves with pleasure, but also conservative students took part in it.
The political issues - the miners' strike, privatization, and the government's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated through обшитые wooden panels walls audiences.
On my first seminar I need the eighteenth-century French text was translated into English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.
"Miss уайэтт, a teacher, now the late Harry Pitt said, please note the first paragraph."
The text gave me with difficulty, I запиналась.
Harry Pitt was very желчным man with a face like a cake.
"тэтчеристы fundamentally not teach French or they simply lacks a brain drain?" he asked.
Other students захихикали.
My eyes were full of tears.
"We advise you to take a few initial French lessons in his spare time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rolling in the society," пробрюзжал Pitt.
I returned to my room absolutely miserable.
In the evening in college, I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a student from the second year of the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the Association of University of conservatives.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"Unfortunately, it is as follows:
On each one suspect in sympathy for conservatives, will be such a mockery.
Me very hard, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most conservative freshmen притворяются that they Labour. "
Later, in a local pub, I did try to face it.
I insisted that it does not agree with all that, "says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick did not succeed.
Первокурсник at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, which he studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter fascist pigs.
You are contagious. "
Other students picked his words.
I was worn, dirty.
"as the Conservatives have sex?" asked one of them.
"They beat each other, isn't it?"
I felt like, must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the Sixties.
Am I ever to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night?
Whether I'm forced to hide their true beliefs and become a лейбористкой?
The three years I have seem hell, full of loneliness and persecution.
The only teacher in my college, has not hidden his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He hated Thatcher not only for belonging to conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser on foreign policy issues and one of her speechwriters.
In college he almost never appeared.
He despised him for provinciality, pettiness and partisanship Marxist-детерминистскому view on history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University билкент in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you're not happy," he told me.
I started to go in the parental home in London from Oxford, trying to find refuge among relatives and непредвзятых Metropolitan friends.
I told my father that hate Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in 1940 there were any political views.
"But this is the best university in the world," he said dismal.
"There is no will, not only in the city of dreaming spires.
Even my friends-communists have always behaved impeccably. "
His wet eyes помутнели.
"Don't take any hasty decisions.
I believe that this is just a joke.
You разобьешь my heart, if left the university. "
I was изнурена regular trips to London and my emotional defense weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, not withstood the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
The next week at the seminar, when another teacher of history quite seriously described me as "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the shower сгорая shame, I confessed that "I brainwashed the brains of the parents," and called them "the old fools."
Respite was short.
The final nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time he wrote every week on two columns for newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I wasn't, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I gathered my suitcase and sat in the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me плаксой and cloth.
But in eighteen years no one should become the target of such intimidation and anger in educational institutions.
The worst that it was Oxford, which not only released 14 prime ministers of the Tories, but also to the present day beneath an undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and dissidence.

"Valentino prefers elegance of Glory"
The exhibition "Valentino: master sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with нати абаскаль, Thyssen-борнемица фионой and other famous клиентками Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of the British Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, worthy to take an exhibition about Valentino гаравани.
The designer admitted that during the opening of "Valentino: master sewing, triumphal retrospective exhibition, which includes more than 130 dresses of high fashion, created his" home "over the past 50 years.
"Love this palace," he says with its unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character whose "or" Signor гаравани, but she could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino always felt очарованным rare and distant world nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition is open until March 3, with personal photographs and letters signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess салимы Aga Khan to Lord сноудона, including Marie-шанталь, Britain's Princess Margaret, and Princess of Greece.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social upheaval: from humble tailor from вогера city in the north of Italy before the international elite "Idol."
Be loving couples in the Royal Court - there is nothing wrong with this.
"They would not eliminate cigarette butts of their cigarettes on your splendid carpet, as some beautiful pop stars do," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-борнемица.
In the 1960s and 1970s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino - бесподобный owner and takes guests with elegance and generosity.
"We all loved coming in his chalet in гштааде," explains the former wife of "хайни Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like мареллы Agnelli or jevgenija ниархос.
Valentino always preferred elegance glory.
And despite this, he is a star.
Valery мацца, representing Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria мацца recalls charismatic designer.
Once we went to dinner at his home, it was after the fashion show in Spain Square in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invitees were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino style displaying around - in every detail of his apartment, in her убранстве, the food, the music.
"Every one of the guests Valentino gave feel important and loved," recalls the "Top Model", whose work with designer began in 1995 during a week of high fashion in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion, because his sketches is real art works," she finishes.
The parade of the bloodlines
Гаравани's life story is not a одержимостей влюбленностей with full reciprocate.
He loves people with a good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Galleries, Somerset House was transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters in length, which offers change roles: a visitor takes place models and needs time to fall, watching "spectators" of dreams that sparkle masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress, which chose Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle онассисом, costume, which used Monica витти in the middle of the night, "" or coat of fur and leather, which belonged to Empress Farah диба.
In the auditorium of the names such as Luxembourg's сибилла блестают models, Gloria von und турн таксис, метте-марит from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Нати абаскаль and designer, in 2006

The hardest job in the world: the miners with иджена кавах
For four euros Indonesian miners risk life and limb, втаскивая 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano steep каменистым trails
There are people for whom hell is their work, while others are literally working in hell.
Among them анто виджайя, one out of 400 miners, who earn a living producing sulfur-иджен кавах in a volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day анто descends on the bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the Earth, hardens on contact with air.
Отколов huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, взваливает basket on his shoulders and carry them up on precipitous rocky road.
Near the top of a volcano, the height of which is analyses meters, only 250 meters, but изможденным грузчикам takes more than 40 minutes to climb черепашьим step, barely holding the balance and gently нащупывая Road, lest оступиться and not fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them life, as happened with one man from France, which started a few years ago with rocks кавах-иджена.
The miners with иджена кавах earn 5 euro 0.05 per kilogram of sulphur, which extract
Once at the top, they pave a road between tourists that their photograph, as if they were monkeys from the circus and wearily carrying heavy baskets, March three kilometers before weights that mining company put a little higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
Speaking of the PT нгримби Candy, the company, which operates the volcano since 1960, and better and not to say, of their employees, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 euro 0.05) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro 0.05) petrochemical industry, because the mineral used in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
"as is the norm переноска 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 million euros) for each ходку," explains US анто, who usually performs three daily doubles.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels broken, but they let him amass 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems мизером for such inhuman effort is about three times what he would have earned in the field.
"поденная pay miners is still very high by local standards, where for the collection of coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and monthly salary equals two million rupees (167 euros)," explains грузчик, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was just 75.00 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the plot was not so heavy, but анто returned with his family in баньюванги, a town near the volcano in Indonesia, for good reason, which is as massive as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to including JAWA, so she adopted Islam."
The анто asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly ', and he has слезятся eyes due to toxic gases
In his 27 years анто spent three years, risking a иджене кавах, sulfur, which has already started to affect him despite masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly ', and he has слезятся eyes due to toxic gases, which allocates volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the fulfillment of their dreams.
"поработаю more than acceptable English for two more years, because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or round in the hotel, but instead he performs work mules.
Dividing up a wooden hut with other носильщиками, he rises every day within two hours of the night, because sulfur is evident at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and shines in the darkness.
Challenging shadows, анто descends into the crater, covering a small lantern подсоединенным road to his каске, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters drag basket with Gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company not механизировала sulfur production to save costs and does not provide any equipment носильщикам, who work at their own expense and with such deprivations.
In fact, they are not even part of the collection of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) for the picture, which, along with the input ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge with his people and tourists who come to photograph a volcano-mules.
"This work for cattle, but not for the people," says бадрусин, chunky 42 years, the Porter, who spent three decades at кавах иджене, ever since he left college.
Can raise up to 110 pounds, he assures that will tolerate job "as much as you can," because he needed the money for the education of his three children aged from 18 to 10 years.
Do not go into retirement, die here, because my whole life is a volcano.
Although the sulfur burn the throat and hum eyes, when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in dense pillars of smoke coming from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains to his severe illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, the pain in his knees and sores on his shoulders, which деформировались under the basket.
Balancing the basket on his back, унайник now can only raise 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades endure 15 tons of sulfur from a volcano that three truck transport to the warehouse in тамансари, overcoming the distance at 18 kilometers along the narrow path among Chu.
"Do not go into retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says унайник, widely opening his mouth, in which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, older, more than 30 years, also operates a sulfur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation is one of the most difficult sessions in the world: what do human mules with иджена кавах.

Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and education and housing prices in the absence of children.
"Singapore's population is growing."
I'm a Patriot, a husband, you're my wife патриотка, make our civic duty and create a life!
May seem incredible that these lines are part of advertising мятных loaves, but despite this, or perhaps because of it - is the video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of rap, which uses local saying such as "let's suppose Bao (булку) in the stove," to laugh fertility in Singapore.
BBH's advertising agency, which has made this video, entertain the hope that with the help of advertising in the tabloid form, they will be able to draw attention to the issue.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of music to people with "its national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we have to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce their kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we must address.
We knew that the government tried to do a lot, for example, to launch the spirits with pheromones or organize parties quick singles (blitz-dating).
Many of these ideas, perhaps, were creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don't we make the most creative thing from possible, to solve this problem, namely compose rap?
1.2 children
Who don't take it so lightly, so that the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 per year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm for the birth of a greater number of children.
The package provides up to $15,000 for a child, extend maternity leave and provide tax breaks for married couples and parents.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is rich and high-tech state-city in southeast Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national management on the population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the replacement rate - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of policy for couples and families of the National Population Management, says that the reason "improved education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals and priorities of life, apart from the wedding and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes of social norms boosted the number of births and marriages холостяков and postponement, resulting in the birth rate has declined in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which focuses on the sharp increase in immigration to confront the reduction of the population, causing outrage among the local population.
There are Web sites in Singapore, where thrives barely concealed resentment in respect of many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, which is criticized for maintaining salaries at a low level and to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also seen as one reason that in the past year, Singapore's ruling party has received the worst result in elections since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers.
The unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility has known the impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to built not so much of a small housing.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
A guide on urban development went to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box" that can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with 46 square meters sold very well.
Nevertheless, there is an opinion that they can promote холостому lifestyle and deprive incentive housing developers who want to build a big family.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of this company El developers, says that their "boxes of shoes sold much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for several days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash earnings increase.
Nevertheless, he acknowledges that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, which previously suffered embarrassment, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too перенапряженные
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules may be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after a conversation with сингапурцами, who work in the financial quarter center, it seems, that they will not have much effect.
"People are overstretched, housing costs, as well as education, and because of this, many people postpone it," says a young administrator.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it's important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and housing prices and education as factors that discourage them to have children.
So, no matter how the government tried to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, in terms of childbearing, remains the last word for сингапурцами.

Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, talking about the "sphere of privacy or private property, which have the right to be protected from any interference."
That is personal for minor under the age of 16?
As he uses this definition in their everyday lives and in the social networks?
Whether he understands the danger, which is under discussion in the Internet situations, which certainly would not have shared outside of the Internet?
Elperiódico has interviewed five guys from 10 to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases they associated with the term "something very good," in a private jet, and "the username and password," when used it to social networks.
"My greatest secrets, I wouldn't be downloaded in the post," says a 10-year Jorge, when trying to explain the personal accounts on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he had for the past two years.
"This is very sensitive secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I загружаю beautiful pictures or pictures from the Games.
Also I play with their friends.
"I would not have shared a photo, which is not mine, or someone who behaves silly," he says.
The boy realizes that bad publishing obscene photographs of people of crimes or write fierce or derogatory comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 in FB friends that he has, and nine of their фолловеров on Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
The mother of the course, she has a password to one accounts.
I started Twitter to express themselves and to write interesting tweets.
"I don't know whether I answer, I only their загружаю," he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk to their friends or relatives overseas rapidly," he points out.
Without question, answers that never would have accepted a request from незнакомого faces.
It would not be with someone who would recommend the stranger.
A 14-year-old Jose case is different.
The teenager have opened accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, my space, and ask, and in the latter recognizes that doesn't know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he points out.
According to the boy, no one to him not втирался in confidence and not requested his home address or phone number.
"If I become pressure or demand, simply remove them from your account," he admits.
Jose became a follower of ask after reading the recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is certainly the experience of what is now known as кибермоббинг.
One acquaintance of my girlfriend шантажировали in the social network.
He threatened and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to Jose, not removed an account.
"only included confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, the boy would have downloaded photos acquaintances in uncomfortable or конфузных situations.
Yes, I would have done it, if people don't like me, or if I like it.
"Although I know that this кибермоббинг," he confirms.
Key issues
Марьелос поррас, преподавательница English and an expert on education and training, believes that, to guide children and teenagers, need to understand that the goal of social networks - inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Поррас indicates that master Pedagogy of Yale University and the author of labor, academician Mark пренски digital immigrants and Aborigines, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
They digital Aborigines, children and young people, who were born in the era of technology.
"We digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.
He said that the issue is difficult, "because we have certain criteria and ask them what you can or can't distribute, publish or speak, in the age of maturity isn't enough for this."
"also they were selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, is to ask the questions that make them think.
"We are talking to them, so they didn't do this, useless," she adds.
Then поррас lists some options: there are things that you wouldn't have told the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would like it, if you like that published a photograph published you about your friend?
Do you know that other postings about you?
When you sign photos with partying, ask whether you permission from other people, to mark them?
And one more thing, everyone should know that you do in every moment?
Another option is to make them understand that they must behave online just as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"beyond the Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, as well as social networking sites should be," she said.
Vigilance
Эстуардо гуардия, professor of primary education, the university lecturer and consultant on education, explains the need for the heads of families faithfully read policy of social networks.
"Every one of the items, they have good reasons for talking with children about perceptions of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what to publish or distribute," he says.
According to the гаурдия, the key question is to remind the kids a lesson "don't talk to strangers."

Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document, signed at the 6th regular meeting of heads of state and government Unasur, however, sources from the administration and the office of the president indicated on the home page that his surrender after closing, but then confirmed that at some point he will be published on the Web site of the Peruvian government.
For questions about the text, they pointed out that the contents were described Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, during brief remarks to the press.
The journalists' access to information about the summit was all the time is limited.
During the day but was транслировано, in the press room, a video of the presidential Assembly without sound with the message "closed session, the sound was prohibited."
The information немногая циркулировала among reporters, was handed over to the press secretaries of some governments Unasur, present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document, common throughout the day, was on the list of the participating presidents, sparking discontent with hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, which asked for more information.
The administration of the president of Peru later sent an e-mail message to the media with a "final declaration" of the summit, however, Humala's statement is concerned, but not on the official document, which ended the summit.
Last October, Peru has taken the third summit of South American and Arab countries (Aspa), and at the same time, despite the fact that this insistently demanded the press, have not been distributed so-called the declaration of Lima, which previously announced.
On the official Web site Aspa can verify that the document was published on Tuesday.
On both international meetings Peruvian authorities tried to have secured the transmission system for all journalists, but the maximum limit of obtaining information.
The summit also ended a joint solution to resolve the territorial dispute between the two countries, Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague court.

"We will respect and comply with the decision, which clarifies the disagreements that we currently present in that the International Court of Justice," said Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of differences, covenants and international tribunals," added Piñera, and welcomed пожатием Humala hands amid the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they flout international court, happened shortly after Colombia signalled this week боготский pact, under which she conceded subordination вердиктам after the international court decisions on the maritime border with Nicaragua, which she was wrong.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, дилмы Rouseff's; Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR was suspended in 2011 after the impeachment of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Collecting the president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for the opening of discussions in the morning and the closing of the summit, a bit later at noon time лимскому.

Among the agreements he mentioned that the UNASUR countries take "important steps toward the goal in citizenship, for which we are an agreement about the place of residence."
He said that action being taken to improve cooperation "in the fight against insecurity and citizens against organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of drugs, inexpensive Internet access in every corner of South America and taking into account the total and effective way of the risks of natural disasters."
Because Europe in crisis, "the Economic Association (in Latin America) should not be триумфаторской foundations, and should serve to expand our manufacturing base and have a better future for our cities," Humala said.
"We have decided to give the privileges of a group of 31 iconic projects that improve communication areas of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes," the Peruvian president said in his message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and limited transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are in a relationship with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve as her re-accession to the Union of South American nations," from which she currently excluded.
The necessity to Latin America was a region of prosperity and peace have been merged, and had good relations between neighbours, was another topic, подчеркиваемой at the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that hopes to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for talks in a form of a maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the International Court of Justice, impugned Bogotá.

"South America should learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that goal is the creation of a common citizenship, in which "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, Peru, state television said that the Europeans "killing each other during the second world war" and in other clashes, "but now they almost one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the draft setting in citizenship, who approve of Unasur member states.
"We need to get the free movement of citizens and workers on any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want to take us back to the past," he warned.
Эквадорский president emerges, moreover, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under a prerequisite for reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those lectures, never undertake no obligation, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, we are.
"inexplicably, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which is based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, hinting at a political asylum, the Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Assange джулиану.
Correa assured that doesn't regret that decision, because with him and he betrayed his principles, but maintained its "deepest values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time were "certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be a process."
He criticized, moreover, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged crimes of sexual violence, while "the Swedish legislation as possible to make it through video conferencing, which can be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa and Assange confirmed that there is a risk of physical and mental health.
"I haven't talked to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said эквадорский head of state.
That's really there, so this is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health of the prison in a small space without the ability to do the exercises on the air.
"It affects the health of every human being," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the problem of asylum, granted Assange since June in эквадорском embassy in London, through the provision of the guarantee of immunity, which would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Sweden, the UK and European courts, and stressed that the talks were in London for solving prison of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don't negotiate about human rights, that we in this case does not use the word, but were continuing discussions.
"The solution is in the hands of Sweden, the UK and European courts, because Assange's lawyer, бальтасар Garzon, leads a number of processes in different European courts," he said.
And argued that "if Britain tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as her perfectly allows its legislation and, as it has done in other cases, will Senor Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or will it on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that does not tolerate mediocrity, lies and bad faith "that distort the freedom of expression."
"The enemies of freedom of the press is not corrupted villains-bad journalists and politicians that speculative, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained content that is neither of these journalists, "neither bankers nor the bourgeois countries гегемоны reign in Ecuador," and added that, being reelected, "deepen the revolution for continued development in the right direction."
Correa also backed the decision to veto the UNASUR Paraguay at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be strong and do not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of the rule of law," because in reality "that has eroded the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy."
Эквадорский president considers, moreover, "perfectly reasonable" to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos's lead is now negotiating with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which it turned out good никарагуанского maritime sovereignty.
At the moment this decision has not been respected.
This is a problem between Central and South American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by a desire to go along.
We need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good end to the dispute on the maritime borders, who are in the same court, Peru and Chile, and said that "the right thing for Latin America to turn to international courts, if the two countries are obliged to accept the decision, however difficult it may be."
Regarding the ability to act as a candidate for the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considers this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if loses the election in February of 2013, then faded from public life.
On the personal level, I was never interested in power, but the unfair situations, such as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can be fixed only by political power.
"My political movement stated that I guarantee that a probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
In case of victory, this would be my last term in office of the president, and then we go from public life.
If you lose, the same thing.
"This decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicholas мадуро, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which has already been planned, routine, and it is expected that he will campaign, to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the intensification of the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the state эквадорского participated in Lima today in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.

The death rate from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnosis
Фабрицио was 21 when he announced that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I like оглушили," he recalls the difficult, despite the whole cycle of the doctor, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
To cope with the disease on its own, he wanted to learn as much as possible about it. And his efforts to materialize - he has already said his 43-th birthday.
Фабрицио - one of the "oldest" HIV patients at the hospital Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (hCG), where he came in 1994, having overcome a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for the past 22 years. "in the early 1990s in too little, it would be hard to believe existed treatment options, too little is known about the disease, too biased treated patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security does not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had such".
In other words, in those times have AIDS was a verdict.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and do so without worsening the quality of life.
Nevertheless, not knowing about the illness, until now, many people come, when the virus has already caused damage, "истощил their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, after the first alleged cases, "it is a great achievement for the moment at least, that the survival of patients who began treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the HIV department of hCG, Jaime Andrade вильянуэва, referring to the fact that this information confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
Epidemiologist and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade вильянуэва explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the extent of the destruction of the immune system in patients with early diagnosis, with a projected life expectancy of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years, with the number of 200 CD4 count, and up to 50 years, when reports about 500 CD4.
In a nutshell, this means that whoever gets diagnosed HIV-positive in 25 years of age, according to these terms, "maintaining control, will be able to live up to 75 years without any problems," he explained.
To assess this progress, Mexicans should remember that life expectancy today is 76 years on average.
Although mortality rates have declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS, dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), and it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients died in a national database.
Only in халиско 255 people died in 2011, and already registered 187 deaths by May of this year, however, argues that there are ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
"Why there is still a lethal outcome?
"Personally I think that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I should imagine, as well as the situation in our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of the drug, the problem is that patients come very late, because they don't know about his инфицированном condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He cited the devastating data: "nine out of ten patients come when, already have some оппортунистическую infection; what we need to do, to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people who asked it."
In its proposal agree experts and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in халиско (coesida), as well as the patients themselves, like фабрицио, who turned to a private laboratory for testing purposes, побужденный only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered sarcoma капоши, cancerous tumor, which is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that they are dead, and didn't want to know.
"Time will still die, the better I'll надираться three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, well I питаюсь, doing exercises, take drugs.
To date, his parents know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I am, I've got a lot of class, I travel, am active sex life, but with the mutual responsibility, care about themselves and about the other person," listed фабрицио, who agreed to share their personal lives with Milenio Jalisco, to prompt his statement in the context of World AIDS Day, those now feel fear.
Let проверятся, if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, so much better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that can live like any other man, being responsible.
This is his message said the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The big gap between programs in health care and the ordinary citizen, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of the city of Guadalajara believes that a problem with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.
In places, dedicated to this task, "actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we have one or two, we now offer packages to 100, and it is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to your condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are you?" is a popular issue, with ехидством and condemnation from the pharmacy staff, school counselors, social workers and health care workers, who don't want to hear the teenagers, assured advocate.
That change is inefficient distribution; that condoms were not just come and that more than a hundred of them was in the slot machines in public restrooms in places, who often visits the youth.
It's not encourage promiscuity.
It's not about payment of beer and motel, said the governor Emilio Gonzalez, when asked whether the distribution of condoms is possible under his leadership.
"It's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available for those who practice sexual activity," he said.
Key figures in халиско
Registered 13,435 total cases (12,158 1,317 HIV and AIDS).
The state ranks 4th place in the national ranking in total and new cases of AIDS and 13th on HIV.
92% infections are related to sexual ways, 2% and 6% through the bloodstream to перинатальному path.
An estimated 50,000 people can live with HIV, as well as the one registered case is from 4 to 5 people who don't know about it.

Given the ratification of the United States court decisions that elides debt restructuring group Vitro, achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the script sets no precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in the neighboring country, which has a solvency problem.
It seems that the procedure for the survival of firms that make Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
The approval of the decision, the ruling on June 15, the practical field judge харлин Hale in the bankruptcy court for the Northern District of Texas, has threatened the Mexican firms face possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door a glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, causing three inconsistencies in the evidence.
As an entry, while the judge of the case notes that lenders should be regulated by the U.S. bankruptcy code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, said the trial for the competitive production in Mexico.
The first section includes the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose was created a model law the unification of the UN International Trade Law, identifying as an arbiter of American Institute of Law.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without an election, recognized as a critical mass of competitive production of the debt, which had branches in front of the parent company Vitro, would not be achieved the majority needed for approval of its restructuring.
This opportunity, however, recognize the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time that this scheme will be accepted.
There are a half-dozen examples, among whom agremex and comercial Mexicana, whose межфирменные debts guaranteed federal institute competitive industries.
True also that subtracting the voices of branches, one way or another Vitro creditors, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds "vultures" like aurelios capital, aurelios convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not have reached the majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These data omits the appellate court.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which she has since 2008, affected serious economic crisis, which the United States настиг, stabbing across the country.
So far the firm of the Gonzalez family garden would appeal to the Court of Appeals that the vote came to the plenum, i.e., the five judges, in view of the fact that only three voted.
In the other case will be charged a petition for an identity that will require a review process by the Supreme Court, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worse yet, the court rejected the document, directed by the Mexican government in the role of a "friend of the court" amicus curiae (), in which described the process, which should Vitro within the framework of the law on competitive industries, signaling that he frees himself from compliance with agreements signed by the two countries, to tie it with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy.
In addition, noted that the country complied with the rules set for the interstate insolvency cases, i.e., the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Карамболь from two beads: they beat in vitro and beat in the country.

"хетин" Hector Reyes: "Basketball has been my life."
An basketball traveler "хетин" Hector Reyes was more than 60 years associated with sports and, through him, to the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in memory so much basketball stories, like "хетин" Hector Reyes.
And since before the hemorrhaging in the brain приковало him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, as a player in small groups, a player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and chief BSN with ковбоями баямона and president of the Federation of basketball.
"I had many roles in the basketball throughout his life, including a few at a time, as when I was president BSN, president of the Federation and the director-general of the national team in the 1990s," recalls Reyes Primera Hora during a visit to his home in баямон, where he lives with his faithful wife исабель for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not exaggerating, making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all with photographs and unforgettable things, collected during his evidence, a long way to go about it.
Баямон in the heart
With the emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, starting in the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old performances in the role of an agent or co-agent contract.
"It was my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because they had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships Cowboys since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There was joy for many years, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I had with one in 1981, the year debut Jerome Shestack минси in BSN.
Since then and continue to become "куко ортис, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember that Jean бартов, who was here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "from me to you, there is a very strong player, rising 6 '7".
"You want?"
And it was the beginning of the минси, one of the best players, who were from Puerto Rico.
Бартов then recommended sniper Raymond Gaussian, which received citizenship and became one of the best strikers.
I remember that said that if минси brought Champions баямону, гаусс helped to win another one.
Чемпионством Cowboys with гауссом I admired, but already at a distance, because they were already in 1988 was the head of the Federation.
By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements минси in the national team.
Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we got fourth place and it was supposed to be the bronze, if not the Canadian judge, who made us play the final game, said Reyes.
The 1990 World Cup with the team is the best team, which you have ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as one that won the dream team at the Olympic Games of 2004.
But my favorite was the game plays with that in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and smashed the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that we won bronze at the World Championships.
The team not only played again минси, Ramona, Gaussian риваса, FICO Lopez and "пикулина '(ортиса), but also the young (Javier)' тоньито 'colon and James Carter, Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Brothers' кихоте 'Morales, who did not participate in the 90th year due to a knee injury.
The team, which probably wasn't the best in terms of personnel, but brought us great joy was the Olympic team and the gold medal of the qualifying tournament of 1995 in неукене, Argentina.
With known players like 'канито' ньевеса, Pablo алисеа and young Rolando хурруитнера instead of players, temporarily estranged for turmoil in the Championship панамериканском Mar del Plata, against all odds, we won the gold.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without doubt, this was пикулин ортис.
His impressive performance at international tournaments.
No one in Puerto Rico not dominated at this level as did пикулин.
And it without consideration of his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best пуэрториканцем leader?
This is a very complicated issue.
We had very good young forest, including Julio Toro, Flora мелендеса, Carlos Morales, Raymond далмау, армандито Torres.
Of the young people, I love the work Leo ариллы.
What do you think his major achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s in BSN was up 17 teams in the season.
What you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to, for example, regionalization smaller categories.
For example, to the boys from Ponce played only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now they travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary.
At least, I see the fruits of course and mandatory certification for governors, judges and officials.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
More than anything, I listen to music, watch music videos on YouTube of my era, enjoy their grandchildren and rarely go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, иcабель, which has always been with me.

The course starts, which explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students study the apocalyptic phenomena, such as global warming and nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria.
In this semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharm decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew had irresistible bait: the end of the "long backwards," the Mayan calendar on December 21, for which many people jumped as a proof that come the end of the world.
But fashion had no idea that he was ahead in the next few months: catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "долгоармагеддоном," and the growing conflict, which involved a place where Christian theorists believe the end of the era, Israel will begin the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that it would be most апокалиптический semester of all," said fashion this week, the students of the University of Rutgers University. камден (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the present time, as if we have only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those апокалиптический thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the theme of "the end of the world" in this semester, theoretically last in history.
In темпльском University associate professor Barry вакер reads "media, culture and the end of the world."
Every week, the students study apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way offer a hypothetical scenario, causing a certain amount of human behavior.
If the nuclear material into the hands of terrorists, for example, the war could ensue.
This month, the students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with examples from real life.
"I tried to tell students about what may seem plausible and impossible," said вакер.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew ресталл and his counterpart Amara солари, associate professor of art history and anthropology, Unite, to read the course, which is called simply "the end of the world."
"We don't add '2012', to always be able to read the course once again, in the event that the end of the world doesn't come," said ресталл.
Despite the destruction, "" неминуемое students must learn to cook projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, a final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that leaves the students "no option but to work through the night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said ресталл.
The courses are quite popular.
"The place was for two hours," said ресталл about his course for students with a high average scores, on which did 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks before the start of the semester from the people, who asked if there are other places.
The students, in turn, is that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see that people are doing to console themselves," said Robinson, a 23-year-old student of sociology and religion of New Jersey, Rutgers University. хаддонфилда камден бриджид.
And апокалиптический thought, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or his absence.
Will векеса, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, said that looked increasingly apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard about the course, which would have taught it," he said.
I like it.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor - not said that believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project were the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we his discredited," said Julie зеглен, a 21-year-old student last year at the University of the West-темпльском Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; this is a key moment in the calendar, said ресталл.
But he noted that there are apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which counts for several centuries, where people react to changes around himself, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it," he said.
Mostly англоговорящем world.
Joseph догерти, a professor of religion at the University of La саль, who teaches courses in the Philippines earlier this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knows about some informed about the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, referring to the higher court.
We have a reprieve from the pope.
Ресталл noticed that many days of the last court heard for a long time, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some have said that they are going to go to parties "at the end of the world."
"Maybe, call someone from friends together to laugh," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the Faculty of communication.
