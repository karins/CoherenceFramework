A Republican strategy in order to counter the reelection of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to combat the electoral fraud.
However, the latter keeps the Brennan Center for a myth, it confirms that the electoral fraud in the US is less than the number of people killed by lightning.
The lawyers of the Republicans have in 10 years in the United States only 300 cases of fraud.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these actions undermine the democratic system in the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US-states for the conduct of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense, the majority of American governments since 2009 announced the new laws, the procedure for the registration or the election.
This phenomenon has after the elections of November 2010 in importance, in which 675 new Republican representative in 26 countries could be recorded.
As a result, 180 legislation introduced in 2011 alone, the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws that require the electorate a photo ID and proof of the US-citizenship.
In addition, these laws also the time frames for the early vote shortened, the right invalid on election day, when registering voters and citizens the right to vote for a Gerichtsakte agreed.
Before the elections of 2006, no US-state of the electorate, a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state, which has such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The Republican authorities rushed, this practice to extend to other countries.
Over the last two years, they fostered in 34 states of legislation, with whom the electorate a photo identification.
It is important to note that the US-citizens in contrast to Quebec does not have a universal cards such as the health card.
In fact, have 11% of US-citizens, that is to say a vocal 21 million people from a government agency issued identification of their state.
Moreover, five million Neuwähler in 2012, do not have such an identification card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars to pay in order to obtain the necessary identification.
The new restrictions are young people, minorities and people with low income disproportionately affected.
In fact, 25% of the afro-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of people over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years, do not have the necessary identification.
This goes further.
The students, who are seen as voters that their voice more for Democratic candidates in several states, it is not allowed, their ID issued by their body.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or Jagdvereinen stronger for the Republican side choose cards issued by these clubs for elections to use.
In 2004, a federal state for the voting proof of citizenship.
Arizona was the first state that such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws that the voters demand that they prove their US-citizenship.
These measures are clearly designed to limit the Hispanic votes.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, the democratic party.
In addition, Republican legislators 2011 in eight states of laws, with which the registration of voters on election day.
You also have the right of individuals and groups, to provide support to those voters who would like to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns to reopen in the general election of 2004 contributed to about 10 million citizens to register.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the percentage of registration of Neuwählern 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
In addition, the Republican legislators in five other states passed laws aimed at the period for the early vote.
For example, in the general election of 2008 were in Florida, 33% of the voters who elected in advance, afro-Americans, although they only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter made only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who have chosen in advance.
In contrast, the white, 76% of the electorate, only 46% of the voters who elected in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed to the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several proposals have been through the vetoes of Democratic governors blocked.
The Advocate General of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could limit the damage caused in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have passed laws that require the return of a photo ID.
However, the newly introduced rules in 2012, no doubt, the exercise of the right to vote.
The democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the adopted laws and see them as a clear objective of influencing the results in the crucial states for 2012.
A report by the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that those countries that have adopted these laws, 171 of the 270 votes in the Electoral College, which are necessary in order to win the presidency.
It is too early to with certainty to confirm that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system would have a major impact on the outcome of the presidential election in 2012.
But one thing is certain: These new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, these actions undermine the democratic system in the United States.

The test: Prostatakrebsfrüherkennung should be made or not?
The PSA test-wise, in fact, sometimes incorrect results on, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to greater reluctance of the already undecided men for the implementation of screening.
The test should be made or not?
We have the opinion of two medical specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States were numerous disturbances between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret the data and clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference in mortality in patients with and without detection.
This study has also shown that a follow-up after 12 years of the likelihood of the formation of metastases of 30 to 40% higher, if no screening was performed.
I would therefore advise the test from the age of 50 years and 40 years ago, if you have a direct relatives, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
In men, afro-American origin is also a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision, as soon as a cancer was detected.
There are cancers, the aggressive and others who are indolent.
The patient must be the magnitude of the risk of his cancer really made clear he demonstrated by the possible options for which there will remain untouched, if he can the quality of life in the long term, and you are not affected in these cases for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many of the men, in which cancer has detected no treatment, because her cancer is not aggressive and not a threat to her life.
It proposes an active surveillance and offers them in a progression of the disease treatment.
It certainly with increasing accuracy the criteria for deciding who should be treated and who does not.
I therefore commend the implementation of the tests.
However, the most important thing is to speak with their doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the International Society for Movember Urology has developed an instrument with which it is possible to the pros and cons of the PSA-tests to assess.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no panacea for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress made in the field of research, the adoption of a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of contracting him.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer cases could be avoided if all eat well and would move.
"If there were no smokers, this value would be at least a 50% increase," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unresolved.
For the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft remains the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, in spite of the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other types of cancer.
It harms the health of the people.
"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million smokers," regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the abandonment of the cigarette, reduces the risk of dying of cancer by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm-, Mastdarm-, for cancer of the oesophagus, pancreas and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that a regular physical activity during the entire life protects against Grimmdarmkrebs," he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends eating red meat.
In a lot of it increases the risk of contracting a Grimm- or cancer.
Salami should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can damage the cells and the development of cancer," he says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists the link between Vitaminzusätzen and cancer.
But now their research is not conclusive.
After the Canadian Krebsgesellschaft are the studies on vitamin E contradictory.
While a study to reduce the risk of prostate cancer discovered, showed a different rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in the cancer has also not yet.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu, stressed how important it is, with his doctor about its concerns and his family drawn to speak.
"The implementation of a Früherkennungstest does not reduce cancer."

The Higgs-which analysed
The announcement of the possible discovery of the Higgs-Bosons last summer has a certain sensation, and for good reason.
It is, in fact, that this which about nothing less than the mechanism is involved, for the mass of all the objects in the universe.
Lastly, it is the last particle whose existence from the Standard Model - our best or "least wrong" statement of nature and the behaviour of matter - predicted, but has not been empirically observed.
But for the physicists, it is still not entirely sure that this really the Higgs.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we have a genuine new particles, and that the predicted by the Standard Model Higgs-like which.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data in this week on a major physics-Congress were presented in Kyoto, but it still lacks data, in order to be completely safe.
We are still working on the assumption that it is indeed the Higgs, because apparently only a low risk to deceive themselves, and we take a look at what we are talking about.
There are in this world a necessarily unmissable law that causes two objects in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to breach the - and try it not too strong, since you are hurt.
Even if the particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that they also such a law applies: The Pauli 's Ausschlussprinzip which says that two particles are not the same room at the same time to fill in the same "when they are", the "condition" broadly from some of its properties.
On this basis, the physicist share the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens who politely be described as Fermione and obey the Pauli-principle.
And in the other the bosons, a nasty gang of anarchists, where nothing is sacred, or at least not this principle, which means that they are, in fact, at the same time, at the same place.
These bosons are organized according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely astonishing) into two groups: They will handle the here we are not "and the" Kraftteilchen, through which the great forces of nature, with which the Higgs-related which would somehow.
It must be emphasised, however, that these bosons not all such exotic creatures are as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it was only thanks to a Bosons of exceptional banality: The photon or the "some" that the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or the direction changes, the electromagnetic field precisely in this place, "disrupted" in about like a pebble, who was thrown into a pond.
This "disorder" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or Ultraviolettstrahlung, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "bearers of the force."
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs-which, with the difference that a different field, the Higgs-field, "" must be disturbed, so that this which shows.
However, the Higgs field-much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogens must reach very high energies, a bit like having a frozen pond, whose surface only by a very large rocks Rocky.
That is why a giant particle accelerator, such as the CERN needed - of the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to achieve these energies.
The analogy of the electromagnetic field is helpful to the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There are, in fact, not all particles, and not all the materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, are doing this, but others do not, for example, would never have a piece of paper from the fridge.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs-field: Those who do it, have a mass, while the other (as the photon) have no mass.
For what all these research "can now be good," Mrs Plamondon?
For science they serve the review of the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists, all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM to investigate.
There are also many physicists who truly hope that such deviations are found, since the slightest difference a door to a "new physics" open and some holes of the model could fill.
It must be said that the latter has serious shortcomings, as there is no explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which is about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, the CERN such deviations until now not found.
Consequences
The effects of this research for the general population are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is no.
By the way: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell-laboratories not suspected that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked in the Bell Labs, in which the laser in the 1960s was invented in 1962, and even the first Dauerstrichlaser (were the first gepulst) - has already said that the laser at the beginning rather than a "Laborspielerei was seen".
Imagine...
Applications can also result from all of the instruments, the research.
For example, in turn Willard Boyle 1969 during his work in the optics a small light sensor.
Although it was not the original purpose of this sensor is today all digital cameras globally as "eye" in 2009 and has him the Nobel Prize in physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it means that you really can never know...

Palliative care, the best way to die | Le Devoir...
With its Committee on "death with dignity" Quebec has recently discussed the thorny issue of Lebensendes.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill being prepared.
However, in this important area still much to do.
Le Devoir has tried to look at it more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer, he aufzehrte, had a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I have seven years been achieved," he said, in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois lying in Beloeil, in which he arrived the day before.
"However, it is always a shock, it could not be prepared," he says.
The disease is doing its work: A vast weakness prevents any alone on the toilet and even to eat.
On the table in front of a tasty lunch, he resigned, agrees with the help of a meal.
He even manages to bravely smiling and talking with the strangers who are busy around him, his medication, and a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that it heals my diarrhea, as this is" humiliating, he shares with.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"During our lifetime we learn that a man standing government," says Pierre Brodeur notching, Victor-Gadbois psychologist at the home.
In return for certain persons Kindheitsphase is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person, a step backwards," he says.
Because, according to several people who work in the palliative care, major events in the midst of this setback.
The patients in the home for palliative care and Victor-Gadbois, are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage they are from the doctors and nurses who look after them, no longer with so called "healing" care.
For Mrs A., 89 years, is the worst fears realised by suffocation, "and" to die.
But the disease, I met my children.
"I have good kids," she added.
"I have no wishes more in life," she says, before it accepts that you set a mask, her in breathing helps.
They are expected in the next few days is still a last visit her son, who is from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois provides you with a group of volunteers body care and assistance in the intake of food.
The palliative care will be used when there are no other possibilities exist any more.
More pleasant for the deaths.
In Quebec, popular residents on a bed for the palliative care.
This is very little if you consider that one day we will all die.
This is the life under the best possible conditions continue, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
It grants the dying depending on a swiss with brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics need to control their blood sugar level.
And the death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we have Mr X a beer is served, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son, the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"We will help families and patients alike," said Nathalie Pflegedirektorin Savard.
The home Victor-Gadbois is different every day.
In addition to an old man of 93, the last Familienzusammenkunft well in the courtyard and is backed by his pillow, while his honour of opening dies of 36 years ago, a young man by his parents, his wife and two young children, is tragically, after he has tried everything in order to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds with cancer patients aged less than 45 years occupied," Dr. Christiane Martel concerned with.
53% of the home Victor-Gadbois hospitalised patients come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, in other words a care that is to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the final stages of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organisations, such as the home Victor-Gadbois and the Society for domestic palliative care in the Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively on the care of cancer patients.
It is this big shortcoming in the health care of Quebec ensures that several in the palliative care specialist doctors of the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and suicide assistiertem with concerns.
For the month of October is a manifesto in circulation, the prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. United Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe was signed their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel Quebec, according to the health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all the right to a high quality palliative care before you have accepted on euthanasia.
Recently, she says, have I seen a patient, the 14 days with great pain in the emergency room was without measures taken to their relief.
I am afraid that the patient only want to die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst predictions doggedly to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, as she has aborted an arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist tumour that I will break the treatment, they replied that they regret that the fight will be pleasantly surprised, I told them.
However, they told me that I was in the end!
No omnipotente care
Dr. Martel thinks that 90% of the patients who have asked to die, to thank the nurses that this wish has not granted after their pain is relieved by a team of palliative care.
But it must be made clear that the palliative care in the treatment is not chosen.
According to prednisolone Monereau, head of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the Greater Montreal talk about 8% of patients not on a pain relief.
At the end of life, the doctors are often on the terminale sedation, which amounts to the patients either sporadically or permanently einzuschläfern up at the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we do not accept this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the option to these terminale sedation.
Patients, not alleviate their pain, all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily, "I want you to put me", but "I want my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible because of a Journalismusstipendiums Canadian Gesundheitsforschungsinstitute.

Immobilienskandale large scale in Quebec
Officials of the Road Administration, companies of Geldbeschaffer Bauhauptgewerbes, political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia every day, what they tell us about a great "system" know in the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry", the Quebec for the taxpayer was very expensive, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is strange how the system, since it has taken drastic measures," recorder, Jacques Duchesneau, MEP in Quebec and former head of the police of Montreal.
The scandal has given him a thorough investigation of embezzlement in connection with the Treaties in Quebec to road revealed the then Prime Minister, who had only reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau-report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he says, "if only the Department of Transportation one billion dollars in the Treaties, because some zügelten" saved their instinct in order to get their share.
The Charbonneau-Commission "already has two mayors to," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in the tactics, "behind the individuals show."
A 2011, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit launched
The 2011 launched, permanent Antikorruptionseinheit is doing with their troops to accountants Identify and analysts, the government also make great efforts.
The police also the "Marteau-force since 2009," which has ensured that the "Kanalisationskartell" of Montreal in artificial inflation of the Treaties is more...
In recent weeks, they score searches and accusations of fraud and corruption against local officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, especially from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec, the third largest city, resigned.
He is suspected of repeated in exchange for public contracts to have received backhanders.
Specifically, engineers have been accused of Straßenbauamts of Montreal, and entrepreneurs Italian origin, as Tony and Lino Zambito Accurso.
The latter has sensation by giving the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the preservation of public contracts.
He has several years of 3% of the value of the Treaties in Montreal to a with the mafia in the mediator of the money paid to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito everywhere in the 2000 ’ s had his hand in the game, more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) at Provinzparteien, especially to the newfound Liberals then in power.
He also acknowledged an illegal fundraising for the former liberal of Nathalie Normandeau.
Kanalisationsverträge whose cost of him were artificially inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption smoothly.
The former engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this before the Commission: In 10 years, he received from contractors gifts, invitations to travel, golf-tournaments, restaurants and hockey-games, as well as in the amount of $736.000 bribes in exchange for Kanalisationsverträge whose cost it artificially.
Other officials of the Road Administration have admitted that they lubricate the bills, with false services artificially by 30-40% aufblähten.
In addition, an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay that he deliberately overlooked over a shadow budget has filled its coffers with illicit funds.
As a result of these revelations is Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, leading Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
As mayor of the municipality Rivière-of-Prairies, in the east of the island, from 2010, they are against the sale of a Gemeindegrundstücks on that for 5 million and acquired for $1.6 million in property developer was sold in the booming property market.
70% of illicit funds in the election campaigns
The investigation will be carried out, in the end, she says, that she "on a thread, which allows the functioning of ants unterwanderten system, in order to understand the problem and stop to denounce the perpetrators."
It says that the procedure "painful, but positive."
We are to cleanse the wound, however, would need a certain fraud investigation unit only for Montreal, and supervision, to a return of dubious practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
For its part, Jacques Duchesneau realizes that "officials stole several hundred million dollars," but, above all, concerned about the role of the "officials about the tactic in the picture" if they are not involved in the scam.
Based on a percentage of 70% in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec recorder, he said: "I was told that this is only a weak simulacrum of reality."
The Quebec government proposes that donations to parties at $100, according to restrict what he will do nothing to change the situation: "As long as the spending limit would not be strictly limited black money in politics, will be in circulation."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for the award of public contracts and the funding of parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by making things with courage on the bottom of the house, we can on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story the international reputation and that of Montreal, Quebec, calls for Mr Duchesneau those who laugh, a look in its own backyard to...

"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season with PSG you have taken on a new dimension.
How do you explain this progress?
You can find it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also has given me a lot.
These elements spurring me on a daily basis, to improve the quality of play.
And in a game that is even easier.
In football is all very quickly.
But I must stop not in enthusiasm.
Since my early days in the centre of the preparatory training of INF Clairefontaine until my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always gradual progress.
You are thus the use of imported competition by Carlo Carlo...
The new additions this summer games are accustomed to a very high level.
They also know that any training is crucial.
This means that a player who, as I have to stand up to and his best wishes.
Carlo Carlo, gives me a lot in terms of my Spielposition.
He is of Co-trainers such as Claude Makelele, of how I played on the same position.
Carlo is the right person for the job?
Of course.
Carlo instills all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1, there is currently no comparable person, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a rich experience and has many titles with prestigious clubs won.
He had contact with great players.
I think that he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I have an encouraging talk with him.
At that time, I have just recovered from a Verletzungsserie.
The trust he has placed in me, is also a statement of my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1, Lyon have taken the place of the Company.
But we are in the ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: We have in this way to the last sixteen.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will oppose very good European teams to have our say.
Firstly, we first of our group in Porto, so that we match the return leg of the event can unsubscribe.
Can the PSG in the short term, a major European club?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a major European club Paris title win, you have to make a name for themselves in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially the PSG funds so that this project concrete forms.
It would be a great failure, not the title in the Ligue 1 to win this, as was the case last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really at the heart of this track suit.
Last season, we were close to it.
In May, we were disappointed, because we were strong enough to the victory.
We have opened the season with a very strong performance.
We have completed with 79 points.
Normally you should be master with 79 points...
But a different team, those of Montpellier, has an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have what it takes to win.
Do you think that the media too much from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept the perfect.
However, if we with a home match against Troyes 4-0 win, and you still have to find something that you can accuse us of, this is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect.
We could never every weekend with 4-0 win.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We are trying to establish a concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League, we have strength.
Look at Manchester City, an association of the past two seasons, fails to qualify for the last sixteen, and which also made huge expenditure!
With regard to the invested sums believed you to break with 15 points.
This would mean that our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, the last season, were not well were from this new PSG "geboostet."
This shows that the Ligue 1 exciting.
I hope that we in the month of May will be smiling winner and tell us that we, in spite of all the difficulties they have won.
The PSG seems entirely from the services of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better, that of a "Zlatan-dependency."
This means that Ibrahimovic and has many goals.
That is why he came and it shows that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he has played, he has demonstrated that he is a great player and a superstar.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respect for the people who surround him.
What he has done is truly extraordinary.
This inspires others to improve their quality.
Thiago Silva, of one of the world ’ s best defender is also allows all others to make progress.
As you have the Euro 2012 experienced with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I was anxious to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented a little time.
I have seen things there, from which I am stronger.
Today, I am, good games in the national team.
This was for my baptism with the "Bleus" my hope.
From what has happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have an exemplary behaviour.
What are your views on the first few months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus?"
He has promising results.
We have a good position in the opening for the World Cup.
The tournament is strictly, is close to the players and to the victory.
As Laurent Blanc was.
But I do not want to comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by us for the EM.
I hope that the "Bleus" Didier Deschamps will lead to Brazil.

With Bitcoin is possible without paying and sell Bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as so often in these technologies a political vision tangible: The belief that the current, from Bankmonopolen designed monetary system, to financial crises.
In fact, by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) invented both a Bitcoin virtual currency (but in dollars, euros, etc) convertible and a protocol for the secure exchange such as BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network have already been some 200,000 transactions.
A few thousand websites accepting Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the price of Bitcoin in June 2011, a peak of $30 (23 euros) had reached five months later, he fell to $2, before he now has recovered to around $10 (the courses are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly age compared to the world trade by real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) in a report published in October on virtual currencies interest for this.
She describes as "the Bitcoin virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as the "credits" that are used to make progress in a video game to win by games or buy (and sometimes British).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, the trade every time controlled from a central authority and processed.
At the same time, all the network nodes with Bitcoin are repositories of the Rechnungsbuchs, Controllers, money-issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Any transaction between two users place in reality between two E-Mail-addresses in the form of an E-Mail.
With the difference that the user for each payment can choose a different address what the anonymity.
A number of the associated with this transaction data will be electronically signed by a double coding system.
In this way, the network, check the authenticity of the transaction.
With the help of the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins in the entire network in the widespread Rechnungsbuch of public accounts.
The crucial step is this new deal in this book.
This is done on a mathematical task on computers is launched, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary Zentralbankier has the privilege of this additional line to add.
It is a carving up the file, i.e. the transformation of a large file in a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
"The computer" take the new transaction and add a number, "chopped" before the whole thing.
The goal is to find the one figure, a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check whether it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to cheating twice very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay for one of the two transactions would only be validated by the network and the other remains without a shortcut, because both have different fingerprint.
The computer of the task, receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation will be halved this reward regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The circulating to 21 million Bitcoins are limited, but up to a Hundertmillionstel divisible, what a certain room for manoeuvre...
Moreover, the difficulty of the task with any improvement of computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin-deposits stolen.
"The used flaw is not the real protocol," Pierre Noizat Paymium has just introduced a company for payment with real money is and the network Bitcoin uses.
The ECB also reports about the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia withhold donations of this kind.
By others as the blog-platform WordPress, they are accepted.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the World-Institute in Israel that Rechnungsbuch analysed and shown that almost 80% of Bitcoins not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega-Schlussverkauf."
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the company, which Bitcoins Coinabul into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book about this currency is, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a business transacting network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner managed its identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented the traders, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
They simply need to specify the address of a phone "and can be detected," Pierre Noizat, who assured us that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend, with the hierarchical systems for more horizontally oriented systems be reconsidered.
"It will be some time before Bitcoin prevails, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB sees in her report, moreover, the various, today as a highly reputable risks in the case of a success to revalue the currency.

We are deducted from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US is likely to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army is taking possession of their territory again, and that the Afghan people to decide their future, without all of us to be expected.
We have, in particular, the Afghan farmers punished, as we have seen them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and crippled.
The Taliban consist of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but often also from farmers who refuse to an armed foreign presence, as at the time of the Soviets.
They want to defend their old and archaic traditions, even if these jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have taken part.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents will no longer be there if the Western countries are more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base in Nijrab I from one with almond orchard hills have observed the use of French loans, properly funded.
The helicopters and tanks-exceptionally lorry convoys have Kabul, without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no air more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since her irresistible march from 1994 to 1996, the conditions changed.
Kabul was empty and the country due to the struggles of the different insurgent groups from the war.
Its coup was at that time as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have the price for the obscurantism of the organisation Al-Qaeda overthrew farmers paid, but their situation has not improved.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire, the women in a position of inferiority.
The most important personalities of anti-Soviet war are once again came to power in 2001.
They have turned themselves in traders, land seized by the government in order to have it as a land of refugees from Iran and Pakistan to sell, and thus benefit from the massive US subcontracting.
They have discredited, and most of them were not even in the fight.
As I have heard in the campaigns, the people want a government that is not from thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just as those who are the American grants to capitalise on the flight of capital that is significant.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and have their advantages.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people who either the obscurantism of the former parties still want to return to the corruption of certain executives, it will provide jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with his Turkish series, the modern world, is everywhere.
An army is now available.
Will the authorities, under whose authority they will be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet fight strive for the restoration of the militias in the province, which is the power of the central administration.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities would have a degree of decentralisation of the example of Western nations benefit, but by abolition of the office of the prime minister, which since the constitution of 1964, the US wanted him a centralised state with a strong Präsidialgewalt.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country since the 1950s and long before dependent on foreign aid.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional out are not available and important irrigation systems were not fixed.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables are not produced.
The private initiative is the priority.
In a country that wrecked by 30 years of war, would be a state control of the infrastructure needed.
The rumour spread that Afghanistan was immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were on the ground in order to seize it.
Without energy to the iron and copper ore on the ground, or without any means of transport for the export of the mountains is not a mining.
The Chinese have a copper mine of Mes Aynak already almost leave, leave the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) on the vast Buddhist site and their excavations remain the most important employer in the province.
One day, it will also be necessary to Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is largely dependent on imports and exports, normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: Girl and Jungengymnasien, Institute for French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), the 2012 was discontinued in dozens of villages, many charitable work and measures for the restructuring of agriculture and carried out by a small French NGO, to try to win "hearts and minds" and the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for the numerous local workers were needed, can help to suppress the uprising: Irrigation, fountains, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil and increasing the farmland.
What souvenir let after spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve the local living conditions in these often at a height of more than 2,000 metres of the valleys are very hard.
In the message written questions are dozens of small agricultural projects of communities Kapisa province.
So that the farmers of the uprising led by foreign groups, according to their own statements in their desire is, would be the continuation of low, well controlled and they directly relevant civilian aid in order to help them.

A constitution with a crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt in relation to the Constitutional Declaration, which granted him temporarily unlimited authority remains divided, more than ever, it decided to go for broke.
To the surprise of all he has on Wednesday announced that the Constituent Assembly the next day adopt its final version.
Just over a week the head of state this House had two additional months for the conclusion of his works.
Egypt is now for almost two years on a preliminary, repeatedly amended text, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only for even greater division of the country.
For his opponents remains the president in his "autocratic delirium", as he continues to be "word" and "the right underfoot".
On the part of his supporters assures you that there is a way of the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the process of transition.
Within 14 days if a referendum to be held.
A very short period, the brothers forces on their projects, the Egyptians to the text section for section.
For the president, it is also a way, his public and democratic legitimacy, during the protest has been raging throughout the country.
After affirmations in an interview with the American newsreel Time Mohamed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians favourably.
Given that the Egyptian people with this resorting to a hasty vote is an ultimatum: "Either you or I keep my draft the unlimited authority", the latter should be after the adoption of the Constitution supposedly an end.
85 largely Islamist members of the Constituent Assembly have the text adopted yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals has not complied with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in the middle of November, they were turned away because they feel that they have not been able to their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or the civil society have equally.
To reach the quorum yesterday morning, 11 people in a hurry, deputy members, added.
Some are very close to the Moslembrüdern.
It is not surprising that most of the items were adopted unanimously.
Incidentally, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of the day... in time for prayer reflected, as some members of the committee took the view that the clock of the constituent assembly was not exactly.
The text that has been adopted yesterday evening, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, of all the attention, after all, was identical to that of the 1971 constitution and says that "the principles of sharia is the main source of the law".
The salafi parties, for the establishment of Islamic law, had an important requirement is the hope that "the principles" by "to replace the rules", which is a more stringent application of possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed, proof of their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the liberals who say this only as Propagandaschlag.
For them, the Islamisation of the Constitution on other articles.
They have in mind, particularly Article 220 of the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, particularly in relation to the review of the compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to the Ägyptenspezialistin Sophie Pommier, this is worrying, as "the people who are asked to an opinion, are not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
The fears of the Liberals will also be nourished by the fact that the next Rector of the University of far less moderate than the present.
"There is no specific religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of which have been trained in the French system, "Alexis appeased Blouet, a PhD on the Egyptian Verfassungstransition writes.
But, he concedes that "in relation to Article 220 an ambiguity may be available, because the terms used are borrowed the religious vocabulary.
It relates in particular to the "Islamic jurisprudence Fiqh" [i.e.].
And in the future could be raised the question of the extent to which Zivilrichter are competent to decide. "
In addition to his religious aspect is the text adopted much yesterday because of the extensive powers, which he criticised the President of the Republic.
The Moslembrüder argue that this compared with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another bone of contention: The powers of the army.
In line with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget, but not before a national NDC.
Likewise, there is no ban on civil give in military courts, as the human rights organisations demanded.
The latter also share their fears with regard to the text with which they see as freiheitsbedrohend.
The offence of blasphemy, and insults are now banned, and serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression could have, in particular for the press.
Furthermore, no article refers more to the protection of women underscores Morayef, 2006 by Human Rights Watch.
In its opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President last night on television saying something, are demonstrations planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the Head of State teeming with are Saturday.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While Member of Parliament and civil rights activist, discuss what use the law on binding language tests for migrants are criminals, with fake certificates
Each year, 13 million migrant workers coming to Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to raise money for the maintenance of the remaining families in the country.
On 1 December, a law in force, according to which everyone working immigrant a test of knowledge of Russian language must be certified.
So far, these regulations apply only for migrants in the services sector, in the municipal housing and retail to work.
The tests, however, with time, according to Föderaler permits for all guest workers on duty in the future.
In this regard, we must not only language tests, but also tests in the Russian history and the foundations of the legislation.
Skills must be both for the preservation and the extension of the work permit will be shown.
Exemptions are only valid for citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also exempt from this legislation are people who their Ausbildungszeugnisse and diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Sense and protection of the rights issue
The entirety of the very sophisticated, under the aegis of the Pushkin-Institute for the Russian language, with the Russian University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can give the tests in all cities; already in Russia were already more than 160 centres.
The initiative to introduce the tests, the deputies of the State Duma and Federal permits.
Human rights activist, on the other hand, before the entry into force of the law on several occasions in the press the following question: What does it actually mean?
What changes does the requirement to show, language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, say, spokesman for the permits, to reduce the number of forced labour.
"Many are talking about the protection of the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the representation of the Federal permits in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights must be protected even before their departure.
Only an organised recruitment is 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Encounter problems migrants without work, education, language skills and medical evaluation.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language inevitably people with bad intentions will meet him under the pretext of aid in a dark, narrow barracks, where he stuck with dozens of his ilk months without food and documents endure and 12 to 14 hours a day working.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home will give you the One promised, and on arrival, you will get confiscated their passports, and receive not the promised reward," the head of the headquarters for migration of Tajik, Tolib Schwaripow permits.
Not, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics in Russia who want to earn their money, not only because they do not speak the language of the country, but also in their own language hardly in writing to express themselves.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, so much as the evil: Only a few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can only afford a sensible primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money, for the children, let alone to feed them decent clothes, shoes and and to buy.
As a teenager, these children then take the first opportunity for making money.
"It is difficult, without language skills," she said.
"You still feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists say the law following important aspect.
The test must only migrants with legal status.
You do not have this status, so there is no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of illegal migrant workers in Russia.
"Welcome" or "banned" unauthorized access
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy in Russia, an official status.
The reason, bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, the linguistic problems.
It costs the legalisation of money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration, you can quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents largely fabricated and we are not registered, and it then cases of extortion.
"They want to one or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea", the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists.
"Just spare no expense for false papers"
Already on the day on which the law in force, it turned out that not only the Registrierungsdokumente of migrants can be falsified.
Some fake certificates that the completion of the language tests certify, have already been of employees of the Federal beschlaggenommen permits.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners this not in vain: Every migrant who hoped to spare as the tests to be paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: This costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
About the fact that the main immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, not just so that the certificates can be purchased, are both officials and human rights activists agreed.
For the moment, the authorities of immigrant workers, which for the first time by the fall, only promise that it is time for a Sprachgrundkurs.
In addition, new arrivals without language offered jobs in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.

Ministry of illegal arms ignored
Proportion of legal arms to crimes slim
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning a tightening of the field for private Waffenbesitzer.
The authorities in response to the recent events: Injured in shootings at weddings and seven people were killed in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Prize.
The police will not-wearing in public deadly weapons ban and the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal, the chairman of the Duma-Committee on security and the fight against corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported and promised that the changes in the Duma on his own.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities by the problems "attraction of the screws are to combat".
The Internet has published an open letter, whose authors - representatives of various Waffenverbände - demand that the authorities of "senseless" distance tightened up.
The percent of crimes with registered arms is very low, said the Strafrechtler, Vasiliy Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crime with application of registered weapons in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period, a total of 1,168 thousand offences.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private Waffenbesitzer criminals will not stop on the black market.
Currently you can in Moscow, according to the authors, every possible weapon for little money.
Meanwhile, the Home Office said that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From factories to the officers
The weapons across multiple channels on the black market.
There are five such basic channels, says a former colonel Viktor Baranez, the ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website, which adopts Waffenbestellungen
The first channel is the army and the military, that is to say, the weapons during the fighting in the Caucasus have been stolen.
The weapons were "by both the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern itself," says Baranez stolen.
On the second channel illegal weapons, which are custodians of criminals are stolen.
Baranez explains that there are weapons that are both from the armouries of police and directly from members of the law enforcement agencies have been stolen.
Other illegal guns come from military arsenals seem sold.
Many Militärlagern often led to explosions.
"There is evidence that some cases of arson, in order to cover up the lack of weapons," says the former military personnel.
According to make a contribution to the black market Baranez also the arms manufacturers.
"Today, there are countless private Rüstungsfabriken, the international competition and is therefore not withstand the weapons under the hand on the black market, for example in Moscow, swallow," reported the expert.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Particularly many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a separate, sometimes artisanal production as well as a mafia, the smuggling organized", explains the former military personnel.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculated how much of each of the five channels on the supply of the black market in illegal arms around.
In 2011, a report from the Center for Problemanalysen and state administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for National Statistics, advertisement literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
Most of the illegal arms dates, according to investigators from the army and the Rechtsschutzbehörden.
Half of all weapons were there on the black market by the "guilt of leaders in their work, which have to do with weapons come," says the report.
The data, according to the researchers, 17% of weapons from conflict zones, 14% goes to thefts in the arms industry, and 5% comes from illegal excavations.
A technician of Waffenladens, who did not want to be named, assured that weapons, which are found in illegal excavations, nobody buys for a long time, since they are outdated.
According to him, it is more likely that traders in the supply depots.
Over an ensign will be a weapon, for example a gun type TT, bought.
The weapon will be issued and through the fence.
"The retailer brings the weapon in the city and sold them for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he told
"The police know everything, of course, and that is why, if they plan to detecting crime cannot fulfil periodically Kontrollkäufe dealers offer by illegal weapons," adds the technician.
"As in" Luxusladen
Buyers and sellers are most common on friends to each other.
I had seen me websites and blogs, as someone who was on me and I suggested to the station "Begowaja", where a person would wait for me to me of a certain place, where we would then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I learned behavior
Viktor Baranez Militärkommentator
"In order to obtain a weapon, I need an acquaintance, contacts,", telling the technician. "I have as a friend, but I trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but there you must go and discuss with a code of such as "War, the building that the daughter has lost a tooth."
I am currently even some knuckle dusters on a friend whom I trust.
It gives me the knuckle dusters also only because he knows that I am not verpfeife him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in various ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez dabbled in the 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the scheme have not changed.
He got a photo album, where "everything was".
"I felt like the Luxusladen", the military personnel.
The buyer gets Baranez not according to a pig in a poke, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I buy, but not just ride with the vendor in the forest, where we present a target.
"I can shoot there, and when I am convinced that the weapon was a good shot, we are negotiating with each other," describes the expert this approach.
Shopping from your couch
Search results to show websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons "for different purposes".
There will not be any papers still needed there is a personal meeting.
"You need just the right amount of money," the advertisement on the website "Kampfpistole or gun buy."
Where users can place orders at and ask questions.
Will also sell to minors?
"Of course," asks users without a license, "Ivan" (direct quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic question of "Fedorenkow."
The Federal Security Service, countless Scheinwebseiten recently, and buyers who want to purchase weapons, go to the service crowding into the net.
People come as hungry fish in the feeding and then end up in Siberia and coal packets
Viktor Baranez Militärkommentator and former serviceman
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible for the orders.
The buyer will transfer the money over an ATM machines.
"In response, he received a photo and a description of the Verstecks the weapon," said the spokesman of the charitable organization "Pravo na oryzhie Dmitri Kislow".
Viktor Baranez stressed that we finally are behind bars, and if you cannot be a question on a Web page.
The Federal Security Service, countless Scheinwebseiten recently, and buyers who want to purchase weapons, go to the service crowding into the net.
"People come as hungry fish in the feeding and then end up in a Siberian labour camp packets and coal," he says.
A Makarov for 100 US-Dollar
The purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, with prices ranging from 100 to 900 US-Dollar.
According to Dmitri Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" can be a Makarov pistol from the type of 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon used in military arsenals seem spent by overseers middle class.
According to the official statistics of the Interior Ministry, the number of offences in illegal arms across Russia in the period from January to October 2011 by 7% to 22.9 thousand, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices to shrank 7.8%.

In the US, Fast-strike Wednesday and supermarket-workers
One in four US-American teenagers sits behind the cashier at some point by Mc Donald 's
In the last few days it came across the United States to massive protests against low wages in branches of Walmart and restaurants, popular Fast-Food-chains such as Mc Donald 's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy' s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still, no one can predict whether the protests further swelling or whether they will be back soon.
The protests by unions and several leftist supports nonprofit organizations.
In addition to the increase in the modest salaries of simple Walmart- and Fast-Food-workers, the organizers of the protests, which aim to set up trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy are not unionized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, described as the Black Friday, which took place in the US sales, the millions of customers, which sometimes four Handgemengen.
On this day, some Walmart-staff, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, and his work together with unions and leftist activists branches of the chain, whose target low and middle income people.
Walmart sold all products, from diapers on hunting rifles and automotive batteries and vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart-branches is an average of between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That is why many of the buy-only slightly paid Walmart employees at the workplace.
The prices and the assortment of goods made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say the goods can Walmart only so often sell as well, because the staff are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, lack of forklift trucks or Handscanner.
Participants in the protest on "Black Friday" demanding wage increases, and they expressed their anger about the fact that the contribution of the company health insurance from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
A typical Walmart employees, the 9.5-US-dollar the hour, could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley show that, if the company the average wage at 12 dollars, it increases the hour Walmart would cost 3.2 billion dollars.
These are about 1.1% more than they donate now for pay.
The wage increases would Walmart to fully to the customers in the future, each purchase only 46 cents more.
Every year, for they were compared to today by only spending 12,39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart note with satisfaction that it only came to protests in nine states and any losses to the company.
The Black Friday in his shop lasted from 8 p.m. to midnight on Thursday, the next day, and during this period Walmart sold approximately 5000 items per second.
As a whole, the Walmart-coffers on "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the company, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the website of the leftist Huffington Post that a total of "less than five" Walmart-employees work and the protest niederlegten just "another PR-trick" of the trade unions, which organized the protest.
"Free checkout!"
The protests were this week in New York, where her goal but not Walmart-branches (which in this advanced city undesirable and that is why there are so far), but McDonald 's and other affordable restaurants.
McDonald 's says that the company should sell billion portions, and yet no sick days we granted unto you, and ye shall not pay for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage in accordance with federal and New York legislation $7.25 an hour.
In Fast-Food-restaurants will gradually raised the minimum wage, but not too much, and on average get their simple staff in New York 8.90 US-dollar the hour.
Less than it deserves no one in this expensive city.
How it is possible in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
Once upon a time, nearly a quarter of all US-American young people after the school in McDonald 's behind the counter, but the young people still living with their parents.
Hardly anybody was seen as the main source of income or planned to continue to remain there.
Now I encounter in interviews with staff of McDonald 's constantly people who complain that they manage this reward and sometimes even their children to feed.
On the other hand, there are in the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper comment, the author points out that it is irresponsible to have children, if it did not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which on Thursday at 6.30 a.m. before the McDonald 's in the hotel Street and Madison Avenue began demanding that the cashier and chefs of Fast-Food-restaurants a minimum wage of 15 US-Dollar per hour, which received more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-industry.
The US-American law prevents the management, to stand in the way of this objective and trade unionists in danger or dismissed.
On the other hand, it makes the management is not easy.
The creation of trade unions in the Fast-Food-industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Discontented
Thunderous protests on this day, there were also many other Fast-Food-restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a meeting at noon in front of the McDonald 's in Times Square, where some local Democrats, including council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald' s says it sell billion portions, and yet no sick days we granted unto you, and ye shall not pay for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also of other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Bürgermeisterkandidat Bill de Blasio, who said that "we should share the Fast-Food-staff, so that they get a fair wage and economic prosperity can achieve the every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest event of its kind in the history of US-American Fast-Food-industry.
However, only a few hundred people on the ground, which is far from everyone in the Fast-Food-industry are employed in the tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilise all masses.

"The brain is so far only moderately outsmart"
The supporters of modern technology popular subject of the enlarged reality in recent times, usually through the lens of a special glasses.
Google first presented at its annual conference in the summer a working model, in November was then known, that Microsoft had a proper patent.
In conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D-technologies in the Microsoft-laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, is clear that the glasses for the scientists of the company was only an almost.
It excites the possibility, virtual objects in the air with their bare hands to manipulate and virtual spaces.
- please describe in your group, which operates research.
- We are dealing with the interaction of man and machine, however, want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, the world largely stuck in the phase in which worked with pixels on flat screens will also be affected, sometimes.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and the radical changes foresee this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console-and-sensors: A step forward, and Xbox will no longer be sold without full glory here, since all for motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- While: The interaction on a physical level, is much more on the flat, sometimes in 3D.
The entry of information (the system more data) could be improved, the issue has still not essential.
We are trying to change that, are working on real 3D Darstellungssystemen on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We must make the computer world in our physical world they sacked and intelligible.
It is, however, important that not only the users, but also its surroundings.
We could then the real world is a lot easier through virtual objects.
And first and foremost we should these silly virtual-reality-helmets los!
- What do you think about meeting?
It is popular, but it will not be overrated?
- You is certainly not the solution which can solve all the problems, because it raises questions about privacy, because they are not always all paper information about his actions and intentions.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers, however, each in their particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of the management of objects on public squares on a project in which we with short, succinct, rather than with sweeping gestures.
The gestures, but not from the Objektkamera recorded by a bracelet that the movements of the bones and muscles registered.
It is still a relatively large, could in theory, however, reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, all in all, however, is the future, for example, mixed Steuerungstypen gestures and language.
- How it?
- We would like to ask you, for example, to these Sprudeldose?
They say it, and hints at the same time.
Normally I say it simply.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to see.
- Heißt that you want the user to a machine that can provide at any given time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that we in the next time, especially in the development of new types of work must be that allow reactions from people in more detail.
The laser scanners, for instance, can be in depth, as they offer a good resolution, which is very important.
- Which claims put on the basis of your work with the Xbox :-sensors on modern cameras?
Lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of 3D detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps not bad.
But the main thing is not the Megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
In this sense, all current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms more work.
It is not only the resolution along the X and the part, but also along the Z-axis are taken into account.
The speed and the number of frames per second is important.
The movements of the people are extremely dynamic, and to be honest, the current 30 fps in particular for gestures too little.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a Berührungssensor with an adjustable Verarbeitungsverzögerung between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with the current commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed just a device, only without Berührungssteuerung and with more frames per second.
- the number of cameras, should not be increased?
- is currently working with three: "Camera", with one of them actually a and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is indeed an ordinary RGB-camera.
It is not used to calculate the Objekttiefe.
More cameras could solve the problem...
Or the problem would be necessary, as more calculations.
Beautiful would be: A flexible ,-similar system, in which we could play with different Kameraneigungen, to see how this in the 3D identifying a position helps.
- if I remember rightly, Google, Microsoft, in contrast to his glasses, not the public.
Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology of the enlarged reality in everyday life the lens has the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant, always a smartphone in the hand, but I think this: The neatest variant would be a "changing" enhanced reality, when we have a cloud of the glasses on the smartphone could switch
The lens is a personal gadget and is its strength (private can only you can see), but also their weakness, for an enlarged reality through glasses that you may share with others to work in virtual objects.
- positions us for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air, not only Tony Stark in Iron Man, but he is also available.
There is a problem on the critics often this idea: There are no tangible reaction.
The hands feel nothing at all!
The responses to this objection to your group?
- In my lectures I speak from the reality of the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second hand as something unusual Projektionsunterlage.
She takes pressure is true!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed the "images in the air" to give something Handfestes, for example, the interference of some Ultraschallstrahlen directed at a certain point where the finger, a sense that at the moment is so weak, but as pustete someone over the knuckles.
There are also bands for the wrist on the nerve endings detect tissue injury in the fingers, this is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outwit the brain?
We think that it can feel what it would feel if it is just a little?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried it.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, namely a people who are physically in an enclosed space, to believe that he is instead, in an open, virtually infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gym), movable platforms and large balls.
So far it is only moderately outwit the brain and we still have many busy years.
It is precisely that which makes the work in the field of virtual reality for a researcher so attractive: On many issues, we are only at the beginning.

My own taste rather than culture - rosbalt.ru
The project "Rosbalt Petersburg vanguard", the urban residents, which is dedicated to the vanguard of art and culture.
On the exquisite list landed already senior representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose success beyond the boundaries of the city, and the often recognition in Europe, with no known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The entire city is familiar with Kirill Miller, the bearded dressed in red, you ’ re at the Russian Museum, sometimes in the summer garden, with scene-meetings or at openings.
Wherever the images of Kirill Miller are issued, they also attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socially-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg vanguard at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and conjures his presence on the street by its citizens a smile to the face and keeps them for good mood.
Recently, he grabbed a barrel organ and became the Petersburg Drehorgelspieler, as he is to this difficult role in relation to his Künstlerdasein, his philosophy and his image was finally ready.
- Kirill, why you are always in red and not for example in yellow and turquoise in the city?
I have chosen the color red as a fashion designer, with the optics and the image.
In this world is red, the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In the company calls on anything that deviates from some of the Graunorm, aggression and bad behavior.
But let me through my provocation with the people.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know that you will have to painter?
- At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture, the main city in my work were issued.
I realised that I must go this way.
Then, the time of the old free, but not officially recognized the painter at the time, and new and free painters such as I was incomprehensible.
I befriended me with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; from "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was only once.
It takes me to the theatre, fashion, music actually to all except the literature.
- And all the united in your kind-clinic... - It was important for me, in the heart of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather themselves together.
In 1995, I held a space in the Pushkinskaya 10, and then there were up to the renovation work a musically-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: NAME., Tequilajazzz, and, I also remember string with his project "Ucho Van Goga" there.
String and his friends sang simple songs for the Play-back, wearing tight shirts and one of them was the trendy composer Igor Wdowin today.
As the group started to play live, was "Leningrad from it."
Trachtenberg moderated many programmes before the time of "Halli Galli-."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he met with us.
Even the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the Art-clinic.
There, our staff and guests.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture or something.
In 2000 there was a poll in the press, the award "personalities of our city."
I won in the category "artist of the year" and that I was at the peak.
It is not easy in new times after old rules to work; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
At the present time it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous, without a cultural contribution.
- your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and bring the timeliness and sharpness of thought.
I will be an exhibition on the theme of "The Russian Museum as clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
Earlier, I was socially, but now it pains and fear, however.
In a clown blurs all this and loses his tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have preposterous ideas.
We save the world, for example, by making that everyone has to fully disguise.
Now everyone on the clothes and is modelled on the exterior and the interior of the people.
But perhaps we should not give a person, but should spit him in the face.
The deception is disappearing through their "dressing".
- Before recently, we saw you in the role of urban Drehorgelspielers. - A cultural city should have a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can also commercial art be beautiful?
- It has to commercial art cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the collapse of the cultures.
The people in large groups: The bohemians loved the One and the ordinary people of the other.
Now there are Mikrogemeinschaften, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I am not "one-dollar-note that everyone likes.
Now you have to consider, if you like.
Now, each Kultstar about 100 supporters.
- On the appearances of stas Michailow but several thousand!
- The abandoned him are women, the sexually-social sphere plays a role.
300 people come for cultural reasons and not 10 thousand, therefore, there is less Management, money, and anything goes.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to cheat and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth, I painted such images in a collector even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow hung.
I started with images, which are usually only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are many misunderstandings.
It means: Intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture, that is something quite different.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and who died in poverty and money in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture, which I support.
Petersburg - Kirill, what is missing?
- Good be cultural experts.
They say: Servant of the culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Czar, it was different, because the Tsar might not seen much of culture, but it is understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow, there are currently good consultant.
In St. Petersburg, we have what might be, the experts, but they will be barred, because it requires hochrangigerer experts, the former and properly assess the way.
Now, only the own taste.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they will not accept all contemporary art and some painters therefore seek other museums.
- What is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the European Capital of Culture in Moscow; there is a lot more culture and a breeding ground.
On our stones can be difficult to grow up art.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because, for example, we now have more writers as a reader, and that is not true.
In Europe, there are many people who are curious, exhibitions and concerts.
For us, these are much less.
Art must be back in fashion, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is the city of Saint Petersburg from grants funded

Birth in space
Planet in peril.
Global warming or collision with Killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Erdbewohnern on board are on the search for a Ersatzplaneten.
In order to save humanity in the future, the important question of how we in the weightlessness or on the Ersatzplaneten breed?
Many choices, there is, in my opinion, not.
In fact, there are only two genuine planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Even Mars and Venus", says the scientific staff at the Astronomical Institute include-Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars, is comparatively build enjoyable on the surface of Venus a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would be only in height or in the orbit of Venus, therefore, possible in space.
The question of reproduction in space, the researchers first treated with regard to the flora.
Already, half a century before that were carried out experiments with plants.
The fourth generation of the Orbit planted peas differed not at all of the terrestrial species.
It was followed by the breeding of insects, specifically from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs sent into space to explore how the weightlessness on the development of embryos.
It promotes a normal chicks.
But then the problem.
"The problem is that the chicks have to find; it must stop on his legs and can start to move", explains the laboratory officials of the Institute for medically-biological problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without solid ground, the chicks wild.
Ten hours later the instincts of a newborn stumpften completely.
The chicks were not reacting to light and sounds.
They then died four days later.
"We chicks hatch twice and the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," Vladimir Sychew for failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last Brutkäfig flew with animals 16 years in orbit.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments continued.
However, on the Biosatelliten Bion "only" homosexual species.
There was an experiment with rats, which already fertilized were sent into space.
In principle, there was nothing special.
"That was just with the Biosatelliten again, but it was only a single experiment, and the research must be continued," said Vladimir Sychew.
After landing the Weltraumratten children.
The issue of reproduction directly in space so you could not solve.
The task is difficult.
Animals in their natural habitat, can easily be taken out their Fortpflanzungstrieb not follow.
In contrast to animals could be the man that in principle.
Homo sapiens is able to abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical considerations such experiments are not carried out.
Yet women fly into space for 50 years.
The greatest risk, there was at Tereshkova.
The most precious that humanity has, is the female body.
Our gull flew, and no one on the planet can answer the following question: Would have survived the most?
After the flight, they bring a child into the world.
"Finally, no one answered that question," says Raumfahrtveteran's Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after their most intimate, gave birth to the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, a daughter.
The father of the child, was also concerning Andrijan militiamen.
In 1988, the second woman gave birth in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja twice in orbit was disinfected and even work outside of one, a son.
Nevertheless, there is a risk.
We have very few Cosmonaut, in which, after long flights all went well and they were healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet, the human race for new paths in biotechnology, the radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor in Vorbereitungszentrum the Cosmonaut is a compulsory Station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of flux win the Cosmonaut routine for the work in the open space.
The water is the weightlessness.
Even if adults water as a pleasant experience, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the small Ichtyander having life on the country rose from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it will be easier for water to get used to.
In principle, this is logical, as from birth to the first swimming just 2 weeks.
"This is too little time to forget," says Babyschwimmlehrerin Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child, so the weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman is not without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness makes the stomach and extremely fast Beckenmuskulatur back and, therefore, the ability to meet the child.
Well, we deal with geburtseinleitende tool.
For example, the birth could also take place in a Spezialkammer to the child.
"But what happens then?", is the not insignificant matter of Valery Poljakow.
On the other hand the child also artificial gravity.
Without the gravitational to feel the organism is the skeleton and the muscles do not.
A newborn child is not as an adult in orbit for training in a Belastungsanzug.
He is simply the missing in his life, which is of fundamental importance.
"This experiment, which we have in common, namely the birth of a child in a strange environment, will mean that we have a disabled, a completely non-conformist will bring people to the world," says the head of the Bioethikkommission of the Institute for medically-biological problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
So far, the birth of children in space mere theory.
At some point, but reality, if the people in their space ships to a distant planet, the home for their offspring born in space.

NKÚ-boss: Control of the black-system failed by politics
The Czech Republic, in connection with public contracts on good monitoring bodies and adequate laws, falls in their application.
In conversation for Aktuálně.cz says this is the vice president of the Supreme Kontrollamtes (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never completely, but it must be applied properly - and I think this is not the case with us", says Kala the current situation.
At a similar conclusion also seems to be a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative psychology, he leads the recruitment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas for the so called "black-system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS entrepreneurs do not bother with controls - the system is now banned or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is illegal, but not just the Regierungsvorsitzende come, and the surveillance office, whose duty is monitoring the application of the law is, in its work, is hindering" Kala.
At the meeting of the Temporary Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a common Czech-German project, in which the legislation on public contracts of both countries have been compared.
What did it mean in concrete terms?
It is a parallel test with which we have begun two years ago.
Simply put, it is that the European legislature, such as public contracts to handle are build on the national legislation, and finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and even though the examination has not yet been completed, we were extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, are the laws we perhaps even more rigorous and "perfect", the actual use, however, is in Germany in some parameters better.
This confirms that it is not enough to new and more precise rules. It is also with the actual application of the law.
How can you help the project? What is for you for this project?
Just such a common control could help us constantly that we cease to perfecting the laws and the reduction and balancing of thresholds, if it is apparently not particularly positive.
Efficiency means one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price is) and illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of threshold values for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this objective.
It may even be that we, the system in this way only with excessive "paperwork burden", and those who are looking for loopholes in the system have it much easier to exploit the system, as if the thresholds higher remained.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Vergabegesetzes.
How does the control system in Germany?
There is a similar authority as our NKÚ, or the system works differently?
What the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent of NKÚ similar to the General Accounting Office, which is like us and also about a college, the only slightly different. In principle, however, both authorities are similar.
Also the competences are comparable to a certain extent, with Germany, however, is a state that these courts of auditors in the individual federal states - this is the German system of our.
The BRH can only control what our federal government funds.
Public resources, which we of the districts and municipalities are managed under the control of Landesrechnungshöfe there.
What the German legislation, which is easier than our?
In general, I would hate to this without specifics. Nevertheless, Germany, in some respects, is often described as a role model, but certainly not to say that Germany in particular is better.
Might it have to do with the fact that the auditors are better?
This certainly not, but as I have said, I do not like such comparisons.
It is worth mentioning that, those countries which, for us, a model are also struggling.
Otherwise, they would have nothing of a collaboration with our authority, is it not?
What the Czech law, what was your authority for the revision of the Vergabegesetzes, you have any impact?
Given that this amendment is only a short time in power, it has not yet in our tests.
As our controls later, we must take place here with some delay.
Impact we feel so far in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have the new instrument "identify risks of inefficiency and" with this almost 14,000 public contracts - here are examined and analysed the impact of changes, of course, as the threshold values change the conditions for certain types of tenders were modified.
You can see the adoption of this law is more positive, or will the system with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction, and I hope that this assumption.
It may be, however, the problem is that the rules are strict "and" cannot be met.
Under the previous rules are the review unterzogenen people against the carrier (for example, in the case of an operational program of regional policy, accountable to the regional council) that any failure to comply with the Vergabegesetzes a breach of discipline.
But then, it is useful to make the law even stricter?
I do not believe in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abusing the system, and not penalise those who have committed a formal errors on the actual decision making.
Such a system requires only the bureaucracy under greater pressure.
Where is the way out?
We say first of all that is not successful.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS entrepreneurs with controls of the so called "black-system" would bother - what does this mean exactly?
The black-system is now banned or permitted?
A law must have its validity, and if something is illegal, but not just the Regierungsvorsitzende come, and the surveillance office, whose duty is monitoring the application of the law is, in its activities.
He can say: "We change the law and allow the thing", but he can not say that we act as if nothing had happened.
The procurement law which owes much contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is for the protection of the public competition also correct.
On the other hand, it is also a tragedy if the bidder with the best offer only due to procedural irregularities.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and this is what I believe in us.

The Straßenmeistereien before Eisglätte warn drivers, especially in higher elevations in the district of Pardubice.
It is in particular to Eisglätte routes of the second and third Straßenklasse and in the circles, Ústí nad Orlicí, turning, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I / 43 and I / 34 in Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow in particular on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
Spreads in a ausgefahrene lies on the roads of the circles Rychnov nad Kněžnou and timetables.

The lanes of the first Straßenklasse are mainly dry, but frozen through.
In the south of the circles of Pilsen and when it can, however, to Eisglätte section by section.
The lanes of the second and third Straßenklasse are moist and therefore applies here too the suggestion of icy sections.
Drivers should mainly on the less frequented streets in the area of Sumava mountains especially careful.
District of Olomouc

Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month ago, to the end of the world?
This is one of those technology-based jobs, on which we have people just like you.
With our band The Tap Tap let us more about fun and say that we are the only band in the world, which collect enough positive energy in order to avoid stopping or the end of the world.
In December, you also a unique project with three concerts at the end of the world.
Can you imagine the project closer to our readers?
It is a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want the Marketingpotenzial of the Maya calendar, whose end-use for the 21st December at 11: 10 a.m. is forecast.
The day before that, on 20 December, from 21: 00 at the same time three concerts in Prague, Brno, Ostrava.
The end of the concerts in about at the time to be on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which in a timezone at 12 hours before us, the Maya-calendar ends.
Who is this idea?
Originally from me, then we have the idea, together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
In this connection, we would not only collect enough positive energy in order to prevent the end of the world, but we would also like to consider together with the public on the state of the world, we handed over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya-calendar, we also have a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key rings on the end of the world, with their purchase over www.e-tap.cz also support the people.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers also the anthem about the end of the world, with the title "doomsday" comes from.
Even today, the hymn to YouTube very popular. It will also perform at the undoubtedly?
Of course, in the end, provided that all is fine and the end of the world is not happening...
The anthem is of all the performers in all three concerts at the same time be sung.
In addition, the anthems together in a Direktschaltung from the Czech television broadcast live.
The text of the anthem comes from Tomáš Hanák, who is also the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also plays Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to the cooperation with two?
We cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene that is that we realize many fundraisers and concerts...
We endeavour to these people in our projects.
It has been shown that most are interested in cooperation with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds of the concerts on the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible Bildungszentrums Studeo, on which we have already six years with the association Tap in Jedlička-Institute.
The students of the Jedlička-Institute are regularly of editors, who will help them with different activities.
As the pupils themselves do not have the wherewithal to the editors, we want to help them in this way.
In the completion of the Jedlička-Institute is a private building, in which we then with this project.
During each concert, several groups and performers.
On what criteria do you have these selected?
We wanted a program that all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, enter Chinaski, support Lesbiens Illustratosphere support, with Dan, The {T} {T}, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Everything else you can find on the website www.kpks.cz.
"Similar" big events are also planned for the future?
In May, we are for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert, we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
We would also like to next year in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we ever in the United States, it would also be happy to appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their Auslandspläne are not just small, so far, you are already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these travel logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it first seems.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the hold. We must also, of course, many Instrumentenkoffer and other luggage...?
Nevertheless, it has been without problems, ČSA airlines and British Airways were always very well prepared to us that I am sometimes surprised have already.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
By foreign travel, you have a comparison, as it is in the individual countries with accessibility looks, as there is with disabled people, etc.
How have you seen these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia, witnessing the east is still in its infancy.
To Prague is absolutely not disabled Moscow, where it is still unusual, if someone in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is, of course, there is not even a wheelchair user, for example, in the elevator usually half hourly.
Fortunately, there are clubs, trying on the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect, we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things, in which we are lagging behind.
This is, however, to note that an improvement in the situation depends also always from the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usual that even people with severe disabilities independently in a public space, toilets can use etc.
But it is not normal that a larger group of disabled people are actively involved in social events, and we are with the band The Tap Tap the West a little ahead!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but only when one of our own significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers are being things really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated incidents of particularly sister personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. However, if we go back a few years: What motivated you in 1998 to found a band?
Then I started as a supervisor in the Jedlička-Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in, with a little hard.
And as I, myself, am among musicians and Sax games, I have, along with a colleague, a music-AG was founded.
Oh, and by the time this is how our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, to say, somewhat out of control (laughs).
The band was known only in the last few years, or not?
It is true that the cooperation with famous singers has helped; we also have also started to campaign actively for us.
We are aware that if something is doing this to the outside world and not to see their own performance is, in a sense, does not exist.
Thanks to the EU-funds can we also good editors, high quality equipment and etc.
It was your aim, it with The Tap Tap so far?
From the outset, I sensed the potential that things are not acceptable.
Often copied in show business today, one of the other.
This is on its way, logical, because everything is new with caution and will be accepted only after some time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that {T} {T} among them.
The first impression that usually has the audience is, of course, pity; this is only of course...
But this pity is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not a lonely and abandoned, which we regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, provided they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities something, not only for themselves is progress, but for the whole of society.
It was for this success is also helpful that you are a strict boss, as we heard by many people?
If you would like to make a good, we must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.
This is, in my opinion, but absolutely normal.
Some are coming to us with romantic notions, and when they discover that they have twice a week test phases must overcome and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm of many fast.
So it works but everywhere, in every band, the serious work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap 20 members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go, which cannot be prevented.
Who has the will and the desire to join with us, is always welcome.

Poland and the space.
Poland was last week at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the Member States of the European Space Agency (ESA) as a member of that ROSKOSMOS s savage twentieth. Poland is the second Member State from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, that on 12 November 2008 ESA member-).
Poland started in 1994 a close cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA) and participated in the following years of several ESA-projects.
The path of Poland in space, however, was much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish Kosmosbegeisterte with the space, they are not always understanding.
I refer, for example, to the lecture by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 in Warsaw Observatory, in which the author thoughts from his pioneering work "entrance to the Exploration".
The ideas of the young engineer (nee 1905), the audience, however, cold, and after years of Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won for "entrance to the Exploration" by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch donated Prix rep-Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a key supporter of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis globally recognised contribution to the development of space, thereby acknowledged that one of the crater on the erdabgewandten side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 in Poland had built a railway-trolley for which a Raketenantrieb planned.
The author of the proposal and the details of this project, remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket to start or the brakes of the trolley should be used.
The information originates exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry with raketenbetriebenen floors.
The research led the Institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents show that the research to the stage of practical tests vorgedrungen war.
The research was then, however, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht suspended.
In 1937, some in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, draft photoelectric Jagdrakete on, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza Leliwa-Krzywoblocky" of the author.
Both projects dealt with the military use of Raketenantriebs.
Shortly before the war, all the projects for military use of missile technology from the Temporary scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, after two years of work, his work, however, from the war ended.
Another article on space appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first is that society in 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in the four large items of space.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a Raumfahrtgesellschaft.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was clear that the future of space exploration.
Already at its inception in 1956, the Polish Raumfahrtgesellschaft PTA for accession to the 1951 formed International Federation for space and, indeed, the PTA has been an active member of the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA-chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for space travel.
He had this position until his death in 1959.
In 1956, the PTA has participated in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, built in 1959, and began in the Błędów-desert flight tests with the Zweistufenrakete RM-2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kilos.
A further development stage should already be capable of real scientific work to do - the rocket RM-34 with an altitude of up to 14.5 km and for the observation of Höhenwinden.
In 1962, he was the further development.
Successor to the first missiles of type RM, from 1962 to 1965 developed meteor-1-Rakete.
The rocket was conceived as a Zweistufenrakete their total length, 510 cm and the weight was 32.5 kg.
From the rocket, three types (meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which manifested in the size of the Transportraums for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A-rocket had a transport with 0.4 litres capacity, meteor-1B on 0.34 liters and meteor-1c about 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude, with all three types of 37 km.
From 1965 to 1968 was the meteor-Luftfahrtinstitut 2-Rakete develops, its first flight tests in October 1970 started.
Meteor-2 had a weight of 380 kg and was able to a payload of 10 kg in a height of approximately 60 km.
Meteor-versions were then musing and meteor-3.
It is also the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, the two years later to the establishment of a national COSPAR-committee.
Poland participated in the context of the Interkosmos-program at the space with Soviet satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosław Hermaszewski after the Czechs Vladimir Remek second Interkosmonaut.

The repeal of the law on voluntary work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court, the Law on voluntary work.
This decision was in the public a lively discussion.
It is certainly interesting, the issue even from a wider perspective.
The liberal oriented economies in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the final analysis, this means that the individual economies in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free movement of private capital, with rampant speculation goes hand in hand.
Due to the large differences of the value of work (wages) Preisspannungen.
Under this term to understand is a condition in which the manufacturer is trying, by importing cheaper goods in economic competition, "" undercut the competition, turning it into a larger share of the market and to usurp his win.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to relocate their production abroad or cheap shopping, or their business. The result is a high level of unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since the capital no social responsibility and therefore not responsible for the rising unemployment caused is necessarily the spending.
This situation is compounded by the fact that the gentlemen entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, and thus the overall economic and social damage.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics at this point are superfluous.
The reckless practice of private capital in the individual economies creates a situation in which the governments are forced, in competition with each other, the social standards to reduce its own population, thereby artificially into the country to attract foreign capital.
In other words, the governments will deliver its own people, without regard to the social consequences of private capital.
This is especially in amendments of existing laws.
The objective of these measures is to force its own population, in particular the dictates of private capital in terms of wages.
This is achieved by economic coercion in long term unemployment, by restricting the rights of workers.
The results are growing poverty and increasing disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany there has for some years public Lebensmittelabgabestellen for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of those affected are already in the millions.
In the wake of the increase the competitiveness of the German economy, cases in which workers paid such a low level that the state of their incomes increase until the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also in the case of workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity of practically all EU-Southern states will no doubt in the same state, in which the people under the pressure of a catastrophic crash their social levels are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century), or for a pittance to languish on the fringes of society, and it is to be hoped that at some point private investment capital flowing into the country.
Of course there is the question of where this capital?
If it from another EU country-, only the poverty from one country to another, or from the capital remains the same, as in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco and Egypt or in Africa at all the employees work for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media say ad nauseam that the state does not with capital to its own economy is involved, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
The private capital blinkered insistence on his view that the state does not lenkend should intervene in the economy.
But then we have to ask whether the capital the policy and that the entire state in their own selfish interests influenced or even.
Here is the unequivocal answer: Yes.
Proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and all the ubiquitous lobby.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual advantage, legislation, in the virtually anything criminally, but nothing is a punishable offence.
In Germany, the situation is such that a lack of finances Staatsministerium private, closely with industry Rechtsunternehmen interdependent with the development of individual.
This legislation is adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence will no longer, as the people of the Western constitutions, but by strong financial groups who prefer their own interests.
Obviously that liberal democracies is currently in a situation which Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic during Caesar and Pompey ': "The state has long been understood in decay, and the authorities have been occupied with violence.
Against bribe through illegal fraudulent use of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption fascia incontinent, and the people went with already bought votes in the election "..." people with character applied not for offices, so that the state as a result of this decline eight months had no consul "..." Man began to speak about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation is a dictatorship and that a strong man "... Appian should be elected to this, but the strong man was then finally Caesar, the democracy permanently by the dictatorship.
As it turns out, is based society today as in ancient times on the reckless preference of their own advantage, without on societal interests.
The private sector is, by its very nature, is not in a position to the benefit of the whole of society and to recognize.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not in the least concern for deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism, we must therefore in the indiscriminate liberalisation of the economies in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From the current state of view, the demise of the regime in favour of liberal democracies as some pause, during which the next round already.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today ’ s elites in future the loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, the humanitarian and social disasters, we have already witnessed today, as well as the crimes against humanity, such as those from the older and contemporary history, in utter ignorance.
The repeal of the law on voluntary work here is not a solution, at least no permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of the social standards to push down the population.
This trend is therefore systembedingt.
The only solution are targeted political-social reforms, which is the capital of the state of the economy, the influence of citizens on the government and the monopoly of private capital in favor of the state in the society.

Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
"... that nothing from violence, or ever could emerge" sings in the song that Sting, whose main verse in the chorus is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons were no war, there would be no", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of: Rothschild, in 1849
After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a host of reactions.
Some are behind Israel and argue with its right of self ‑ defense, while the Palestinians as terrorists; the other, in turn, support the Palestinians, arguing with the racism of the Israeli State, with the genocide perpetrated against the Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel as a terrorist.
I should like at this point not write about who these recurring waves of killing guilty person and who victims is, ultimately, the current residents of Israel, including the Selbstverwaltungsgebiete born in the current political situation and the beginning of the violence themselves do not.
My concern is that readers look behind the scenes, the look, for whom the 95 years voltage (counting from the United States-declaration in November 1917) in the small parcels of land in the Middle East, above all, to serve.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from, and go out from my own understanding of who or what group of people make the events of the modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
Every time we can have a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question whether it really always these personalities, autonomously given its steps, or if someone behind their throne of their actions, to a vorbestimmtes goal.
We must admit that we live in a time in which the wealth of the world less concentrated in the hands of individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power within the lifespan of a generation.
Under these astronomical stings a rich families, which one might call as head of octopus (I do not know whether someone is still on them, I support this but not from) - the Rothschilds.
Much will not written on them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was from the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century, bought the combination of their name with hochkriminellen deeds, in whose background is the consolidation of their power, the proliferation of their assets or both.
The Rothschilds are almost all central banks in the world, and the countries in which they are involved in the central banks lead wars or equip them to this (before the attack on Afghanistan, it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq, there were 5 countries after the fall Ghaddafis remained just four, with Russia ’ s central bank, in the meantime, the Russian government has implied).
Whoever has tried to this family, had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln declined, the status of the Central Bank, Bank of America to renew during the civil war, started their own (read: State) notes and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to publish their own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; the honourable Member Louis Mc Fadden in 1936, after he was poisoned the Fed for triggering the Great Depression wanted to sue.
The global Machtgelüste led the Rothschilds in 1859 - 1871 to formulating a plan to unleashing of three world wars by Albert spades, a Freemasons in the 33rd, and therefore the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war to the great Monarchist Staatenwesen Europe, through the second war in Britain ’ s colonial rule should be broken, and the third war is the world ’ s population of about 0.5, 1 billion people (such a number would reduce their facilities and its luxury and would also not so many resources) to create a culture of ecumenism is nothing more than the apron) and, finally, to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top, is the launch of a crisis and the subsequent offer a solution (order from Chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the Fed to prevent crises like the triggered not repeat in 1907).
Having them by the murder of the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, the First World War, they destroyed the Russian empire through the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (instead of the destruction of the war was no longer required), then, the dissolution of the Central European superpower Austria-Hungary.
In the Second World War, easier to spark the bankers, the policy a latent conflict by Germany with gigantic Kriegsreparationen occupied; thus they created the condition of impoverished masses so that they only have the Germans off a sufficiently strong leader, of the culprits and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, the function of a fifth column should take, and also the Kriegsbrand.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of the establishment of a state sought, as in the historic area of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The United States already mentioned-declaration created the prerequisites for the immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to first clashes with the resident Arab population.
Terrorist attacks, there were on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler from the chain losriss in which it initially had kept the international bankers, or whether it all went according to plan, is hard to see, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in concentration camps, the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948 and, as well as by the Kriegsreparationen against Germany in the ground for the Second World War was prepared, the declaration of the state of Israel, the creation of the Brennpunktes for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will be able to unleash this war, the Jewish people as in World War II to the victims in front of the stage, this time Kampflinie together with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of dispute and the chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how strongly people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who the victim in the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelites, where only erred in an endless cycle of violence, and at the beginning of the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
It takes between the people of Israel, and differentiate their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel as well as we, the people, exclusively their own candidates to choose from.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawkish Netanyahu, is a typical example of a faschismusanfälligen, international bankers loyal subordinate politician who is doing everything possible to ensure that a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), quickly becoming a global conflict could extend, and where it because of the control of Iran on the only 2 miles wide Strait of Hormuz, about 20% of global oil supplies run, to a destruction of the world economy.
In which light as the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is a all overarching crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
In their view, the new world order, a world of men and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population of a small group of Finanzaristokraten.
A world in which every babies at birth is a chip implanted this essence of total control.
"And it is that the little ones and the Great, the rich and the poor, the Free and the servants all give a Malzeichen in their right hand, or in their foreheads that no one can buy or sell it for stigmatic, which is the name of the animal, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom, intellect, who consider the number of the animal.
Because it is of a human figure, and his number is sechshundertsechsundsechzig. "

The film Argo: If 's worst call, Hollywood
In November 1979 Islamist students occupied a mob who demonstrated the US-American Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the following the revolution in the US, which for decades had fled the patronage of his regime had maintained.
For the American Government, there were no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to jettison the Shah, as this is the confidence of their allies in other countries have been severely damaged.
At the same time, she was not in the situation in Iran, where the revolution in the establishment of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco when violent attempt to retrieve made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released for 444 days after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages, home to a wave of solidarity and antiiranischer moods.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to defeat Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film Argo of director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, the US a partial victory.
Just before the occupation of the message, six Botschaftsmitarbeitern the flight.
This ended after numerous complications in the home of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, the refugees from Iran; then helped them an extravagant story for the concealment of their true identity - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a Filmstabes locations, the supposedly in the country for a science-fiction-film.
Combination of genres
The experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed plan also made the cooperation of Hollywood.
The disguise was credible, published articles in professional journals about this film, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were long kept secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a particular combination of several Filmgenres.
On the one hand, he is a more realistic and, at the same time, leading a so called "Caper Movie", i.e., the story of a successful Husarenstücks such as, for example, the film Ocean 's Eleven.
This alternate in the movie the Stimmungsebenen - on the one hand the Dokumentarszenen from Tehran (in the title sequence are iconic contemporary photographs shown to be watched, and also in the same situations, there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, the ironic and devising so easily.
And then there ’ s the-scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the conference table, on the Amtsfluren, on the phone...
Ben Affleck with this film is a remarkable reboot of his career.
From a spokesmen ridiculed actor is a respected director, and also as an actor, he is no longer the target ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller No breeze (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without mercy (2010).
At the same time, it is the first movie Afflecks, not in the local Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the village belonged to the characteristics of the previous films, the director of the standard Hollywood.
Affleck proves this sense, however, also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada "played."
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and demonstrate the reconstruction of events which have indeed taken place - the Eingangssequenz the storming of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, however, and conveys a sense of confusion and the unpredictability, that happens, if somewhere even the story.
A similar effect Affleck with his team in fictitious scenes (the wrong Filmstab at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to deal with that, too, that the story is not many in the cinematic sense exciting scenes.
He is working with the little but quite successful, although he sometimes nachhilft reality - something which would not always so elegantly acting (the scenes in which the looming crisis in the airport in Tehran of a telephone conversation in America is avoided, or the chase on the runway, looked a bit contrived).
The weakness of Argo is his overly broad scattering, which is due to the need for too much in action in too many places to show.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are in their roles as Hollywood-staff is very charming, its characters but would have more space, and they are in the film is far from alone.
Afflecks film loses traction by something. It is a movie you with some interest and the design and to a thriller from the 70th years can approve of its retro-style.
However, he enthusiastically raises difficult.
As a reminder of a until today in some way living piece of history and as evidence of how exaggerated but the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are, however, he is sufficient.

Guidelines for the inflate of balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, an annual survey on the oddest of bank charges this year, has decided that the competition "Absurdeste regulation or idea from the EU-workshop".
"This idea brought us the latest plan put forward by the EU, a 40% quota of introducing in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, the organisation of this survey, Právo told the newspaper.
The absurdities is, for example, the judgment of the Court of Justice on the unification of Versicherungstarife for men and women.
Until then, women in an advantage enjoyed life insurance for insurance companies, because they are objectively less risk.
"Another incredible incursions from the EU-workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013 Nacher with, "said.
The controversial EU-regulations include the mandatory admixture of bioethanol for fuel in its wake naturschädigend is, the more the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, just because it is a relatively small amount of this Gefahrenstoffes, or the directive on the size of Hühnerkäfigen this year, because of the eggs were significantly more expensive.
Scores of criticism in the past, the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or even a ban on the sale of conventional lamps.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU decides-apparatus often under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels in the rule of one or more Member States will be represented at the moment (so tried the Czech Republic, for example, also with veto-threat to the demands of Czech banks).
Lobby-interests were also discovered that the highest Handelsklasse bananas in the EU must be at least 14 cm long Krümmungsanomalie "and not" are not allowed.
The European Commission defended themselves with the argument that they are only the fragmented national standards harmonisiere, the trade.
The standards relating to fruit and vegetables from the EU were against the opposition of some countries have already weakened by pointing out that the previous directives to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this poll is perhaps the EU-regulation of last year, according to balloons sales must be provided with the hint that children under eight years the balloon not without the supervision of an adult bloat.
The EU, citing an American study in accordance with balloons at the leading cause of death by suffocation of children.
A similar restriction is already for children up to 14 years in the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are also curious incursions at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that European officials itself - everyone in the EU has an official function, because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece does not use the name Macedonia and FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists let fair in addition to the above mentioned absurdities also the EU-regulation on the scale of Lebensmittelvorräten in the territory of a Member State.
The EU, so that the maximum volume of Lebensmittelvorräten firmly focused on the day of our EU-accession on the territory of the Czech Republic was located.
The Czech Republic then crossed the fixed volume for Pilzkonserven result for us.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money that they have no sea, or of the idea of funding for applications for grants.
These ideas were not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are affected by that we have no sea.
We will refund request in the EU in the autumn of 2004, "said the former Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As the argument that the harvest was very high and the government as a result of the so called Interventionseinkäufe camp.
As the Czech Republic, another way to sea ports, the EU should have the Palas hundreds of millions of euros of us pay.
The European Commission has so far in the Czech Republic, finally, that they have a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries, which have no access to the sea.
Grants for applications for funding offered the municipalities of the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-deu) should, in practical terms, this means for the establishment of Fördergeldanträgen act in Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations are in the Member States are easy targets of criticism, the efforts of the EU regulation and thus also for effectiveness and development of the whole European Union, according to some experts, however, deserves more credit.
A more serious problem is rather that experts believe that the EU-funds for projects that are absolutely nothing with the deepening of European integration, but they have in common with the budget negotiations have been forced by individual Member States.
Emotions calls here also the fact that the Czech Republic, similar to other Member States in Brussels for the right to use of specific descriptions of traditional products and to fight this fight is not always wins.
The Czech Republic, six years after a fight with Germany and Austria, the term "Olomoucké tvarůžky" defend the Inländerrum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition with us back to the 19th century, however, our manufacturers in "Tuzemák."
The name rum may only be used for products from Zuckerrohrdestillat, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products in the EU in the company of the world famous cheese, feta and gorgonzola started the Lübeck or Parmaschinkens now also the Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or even the (hops.
With an EU-brand as the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořicer roles to shout about.

"The people want the Republic save, but I am just an amateur Okamura," said.
Mr Senator, how do you get to the idea, to seek the presidency?
I am not seeking to Senator or to be president.
If everything in our country would work without problems, I would be nowhere.
But I can no longer see the republic for 20 years, as thieves plundered roam free, while the people of the taxes and increasing the retirement age.
I had no ambitions, politicians.
When I see something, but what I do not like it, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And because I have more than 40 am, and independent and cultural heritage, and I have no other choice than to change things for senator or the president to stand.
In the Senate, you have managed and then straight on the road to the castle.
Return the back not your voters?
I have said all the time that the battle for the castle to the outcome of the senatorial elections.
Later, I have this clarified and I said that I was a candidate for the office of the president, if I am elected a senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is a tool with which I can realise my vision.
But I was as much influence and a strong mandate.
The problem is not just that we as a people in the pub and in front of the television, but starting, which wants to make a difference.
The media, which want to steal the honour, and the freedom of speech and the freedom to lie.
About me was, for example, claimed that I would journalists bribe or that I consultant by Jiří Paroubek was.
We are talking about your visions.
The fight for the castle, you have with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retrospective Vermögenserklärungen over 20 million crowns.
You have to change laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can bring legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I have campaigned for the travel guide a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is the quarrelsome policy - when someone from the right or from the left with a good proposal is rejected, it is deliberately, and that keeps the population only.
As an independent Parteiloser I have a far greater potential, support for all the parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage is that I am without Schubladendenken Parteidogmen of each party and the, which is the best for our country.
Watch as a person in the policy more right or left?
From Czech view seems to me that I am rather see the people on the left.
For me, this right-thinking-links but totally irrelevant.
For me, important that we can make progress.
It is not a question of whether someone to the left or to the right; I want the people.
Always, I support publicly any good approach, even if this from the sides or of the ODS, and equally I will turn against bad ideas.
It bothers you, if someone you as populists.
But this does not make you confirm what you have just said.
If you are a business plan in a company, then you have also a Idealziel and a vision.
And this would you approach.
You can not describe it as populism, but all proposals, of which I have spoken, work in the world, or they were of important experts.
Without support in Parliament, but you still have only keywords.
And this brings you in the long term in politics.
Or do you think that you, if you just long enough to talk to the people, for example, will manage the material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Politicians, journalists and the public and to try to persuade them to get on our side to these targets.
As president, it would be not a problem for me, the chairman of the parliamentary parties to live on television, the material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors to legislate.
And the addressee may then have to say why they refuse.
A strong personality, which points to grievances, can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the President, which is a credit to the public pressure.
I would like to make it quite clear that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius or an intellectual.
I try to allies for my views and vision.
With the policy, I have only just started, for my programme and the support of the majority.
I always try to assess things themselves; and if it does not work, then I am in six years in the private sector.
It sounds a little as if Okamura the Czech Republic should save.
I am not a savior.
I know that I alone, and that is why I have nothing do with several celebrities wondered whether they do not want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura, however, refused to work.
In addition, I have supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, the fraud in trade with light fuel oil.
I began my candidacy with the condition that the people are deeply unhappy, but now I am not more secure.
Sixty percent of voters are left to the elections, and those who have gone to the elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are so that only two Independent.
The people have chosen such a Senatszusammensetzung that changes will be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and Bezirkshauptmänner.
Do you think about the creation of a separate party?
I have not thought about it, because I have no time in the past to check each potential Parteimitglieds, and does not have the money.
I still have not even money for the Präsidentenkampagne; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
They have no money?
You talk about Vermögenserklärungen, what would your?
My personal wealth I value to about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I had a plot with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection, which is worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a superb Škodu, about a million is worth. And then I have a few million on the account.
The Aston Martin was a dream - James Bond has always liked me, as in the car he was driving was galant to women and, at the same time, against evil.
They drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the Republic, but your own money, you do not want to invest in it.
This is not particularly convincing.
I have no 15 million for the campaign.
Shall I make about debt?
I have already 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors, shows that my program is probably not too much interest.
And I am not obliged to the campaign from its own resources.
The cost of the campaign are, in fact, covered by my salary as a senator.
But the Senatorengehalt alone I could not live; so I could not, for example, my son, the English school finance the 30,000 per month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I would stand for nothing.
You will therefore continue to work as entrepreneurs to have your livelihood?
You said that you go back these activities?
But that does not depend on the amount of salary.
As promised, I have in my activities.
Thus, for example, my deputy managing director of travel agencies in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan, of the republic.
But I have to live but also of something.
To which you were accustomed to such as entrepreneurs?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and this is still the case.
As President, I would, however, all my endeavors.
The complete conversation can be found in the period of Právo.

The MVRDV architects show that the real adventure not only in the head - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find it funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," said Lisette Verhaig, a roadside Passantin.
And Stefan Spermon, IT-technician at a nearby corporate sector, says: "But, well, it is already, the house."
However, I wonder why we still need a library.
All have Internet, iPad and E-Books.
No one is still voluntarily in one of these old-style-libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little besichtigungsbedürftige Schlafstadt before the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitants-community has the lowest education rates throughout the Netherlands.
In order to counter this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and the seven fictitious bridges on the frontloading are portrayed as a pretty bepinselte Stahlbetonminiaturen.
The success of the Marshall.
And so, the dominant that there is only one way, the statistics: A library to that!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam architects MVRDV, Master of the heroic Balkendiagramme and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the same composure and appeared on the competition-hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a big smile on his face.
And while the jury is still looked perplexed and top with the armpits wincing, the cheeky Maas his exquisite souvenir of a pyramid and finished his actionist based speech with the words: "Love municipality!"
This is it, then, my proposal for the Bücherberg from Spijkenisse, for the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million built expensive mountain.
He is part of a Revitalisierungsprojekts to the underground car park, supermarkets, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless Kleinstadtretorte that to date no longer had to offer as a postmodern pedestrian area and a stunned ugly Town Hall, whose white facades behind a Molkereifabrik would be inclined to suspect, a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, however, has now Spijkenisse on the first public Kulturbau in the history of its existence.
The long road to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under glass.
There is a lift, in the middle of the mountain massif, but the real space and rage (Lesefreuden when climbing the topography.
The completely glazed interior is bright and clear, the burned Klinkerboden unequivocally and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
We are already looking for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And all books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, of the most uncomfortable and impersonal is", says Winy Maas.
We have the classic Raumkonfiguration upside down and the reading area from the inside to the outside this House.
The interior of the Bücherbergs is shrewdly: In the middle are offices, Internet-library, Schachclub, environment centre and Haustechnikzentrale.
A particular pleasure are the black bookshelves, the times wall panels, sometimes parapet, sometimes Stiegengeländer.
Look, feel and smell are strange.
Even a architects and building engineers whether unknown Baustoffs shake of the head.
"We wanted to work with recycling-materials," said Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we are in a friesländischen Agricola one day on a waste product from agriculture.
For many years we used in the Netherlands in greenhouses and fields as Wurzelunterlage millimeterdünnes Kunststoffvlies.
It is cheap and efficient.
The thin textile holds a, two seasons, then it is ripe for the bottels.
For the library was the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - to four centimetres thick plates.
Under Hitzeeinwirkung and pressure, the socalled Landbouwplastic (KLP) to a dark, homogeneous, stress resistant material that was a little after new cars and a little after tennis shoe.
After 105 steps you are arrived at the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 metres long wanderings in Literaturcafé will not only with a fantastic view over the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and eingetopften Ficusbäumen rewarded.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the proper humidity in Literaturgebirge.
Donations for the new soul
"You would not believe but this House, in spite of the many glass is a flagship project in terms of the environment," says Trouborst.
Is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg under a Glassturz, the sun is shining even on sunny days just inside.
The broad lumber to serve as shading glass facade, and a large proportion of sunlight.
The climate is very pleasant.
The rest fully automated blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT-industry, already ventured into the new library.
Also, Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM-teacher, Cynthia Bogarde Boekenberg even Spijkenisses "long overdue soul".
The reason: The opening a few weeks ago, each residents invited to a book from his personal collection.
That is for the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 piece - be filled.
The concept is.
The shelves are filled up obenhin.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty Library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation has now all inhabitants of a certain kind of relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only to grace.
That is the pinnacle of the MVRDV those who, in the jargon identity.
Literary history Spijkenisse has written.
So young and uneducated they may be.
That is a starting point for identity.

Szabo: "German must play a greater role"
Germany has in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin balanced on a narrow diplomatic degrees.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had initially indicated that it against the request for an observer of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But abstained from Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis in Gaza have done, not.
Germany must now because of its special relationship with Israel, however, be careful.
But, at the same time, I believe that it is not the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence, without having to be too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to set up a no fly zone.
This was finally by NATO.
It is hard, Germany in important international issues to adopt a clear position?
Yes, that is true.
The reason is that surrounded his foreign policy away from a policy that has been managed by the United States, so to speak, to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, the Europeans have no coherent and consistent policy.
The Germans are so between the fronts.
One expects of them that they play a more independent role, because they are not accustomed to.
I believe that they are still in their role, but they are on the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or the United Kingdom.
What does a "normal" foreign policy because specifically from a German point of view?
It shows a willingness to national interests and positions that are independent of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany ’ s economic interests are to a certain extent, unlike that of the other great powers and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influence on the position of the conflict in the Middle East and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
It should therefore be careful, the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, not to offend the.
In any case, the plays a role.
But I would not want too much weight to, this is not a totally biased relationship.
In any case, but it plays an important role in German considerations.
Germany has its relations with the United States, damaged by the important decisions, such as abstained in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that, in Europe, and even in the US, there is a great deal of sympathy for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this is such a dramatic break was, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany is so that even a certain respect.
But because it signalled that it be taken seriously as an international player and his interests should be considered.
In Europe there are various opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, have been clear for a veto.
There are differences between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama secretly probably pretty much sympathy for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, can the government publicly not, of course, this position.
I believe that the actual differences are not so great as they always have.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so audience of Netanyahu ’ s policies.
It is Germany hard, its close relations with Israel and the United States on one, and the position of the main partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that that is exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
This would, of course, be a bit easier for the Germans, if there is a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can not part of a wider line and must instead be things from their own position.
They just do this with the euro.
I believe that in future, Germany, a leading role in Europe to a European position.
That is, of course, not just for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I believe that the German, it is clear that they have a more independent role to play.
Faces Germany itself in the role as a major global player - wants Germany to take a leading role at all?
Or is the lead Germany still difficult?
Germany is still not accustomed to the is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult to land a major role to play.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, because every time that Germany will be a greater role, various anti-German feelings.
This makes it the Germans not easy.
This is, in fact, the old problem: You want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, Germany in a far worse position than the US.
There must be susceptible to a variety of neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now, the influence of the United States in the European policy, the EU has filled the vacuum at the moment but not, who is otherwise?
The Germans are simply need to play a greater role.
Even if they do not like them, it is unpleasant and they still have a lot of unpopular, c 'est la vie!

"Brand protection in China:" If Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
Conceals a in China officially registered designation, which have nothing to do with the Ursprungsunternehmen.
Still, she enjoys protection so long as the actual namesake not complain.
And even then is not clear whether they will get justice.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners, to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing on property right infringements in the Far East.
Every week a new case ends up on my desk.
The other rich a few additional letters, so that they register their brands.
It is from Gucci simply Lu-instead of Prada, Gucci, Prada-Kny.
German companies are also in this way, legally copied some of the manufacturers.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the Trade Mark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company in the trademarks Zegna DF Puma, a somewhat synthetic label, which is also used in the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese world champion in copying and the injured intellectual property, is known.
In the big cities, there are multistory department stores, which sell almost exclusively counterfeiting.
Pattlochs cases but are different: On behalf of his clients, he goes against Chinese companies from the Trademark Office officially, a name given the right to use the already elsewhere is protected.
The Chinese call the "bang", a Beifahrermarke Mingpai.
The word is modelled on "Bang Dakuan."
That women were being rich men fishing.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame
"It will be bad for business, we must combat Pattloch, calls it".
"The brand will be diluted, the uniqueness will disappear, the damage is enormous."
The financial losses and litigation costs of the industries concerned are going in the millions, especially in expensive Vorzeigeprodukten.
According to the Marktforschungsgesellschaft CLSA is China with a volume of EUR 15 billion in the year of the third largest market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the registered are difficult to reach and go to the money.
Up to nine years is the proceedings drag on, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reporting of cases in which the court overruled claims, because after the long duration of the defective name had become the "reality".
If the plaintiff had the misfortune to pay Plagiator even money because he violated its brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes, there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also affect graphical elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal dispute with the Baumaschinenhersteller Sany, the company that recently took over the German Betonpumpenbauer Putzmeister.
The Chinese must therefore still use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes-star.
The Volvo-buyer Geely took advantage of a blue-white logo, the BMW reminded; the dispute was resolved, Geely had to change it.
The Modehersteller Lacoste lost against counterfeiters in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, which the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are aware of any blame.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing is that there is 2010 due to staffing and finishing of bottlenecks.
Last year, however, is one of the "emergency" in the workflow returned to normal.
So is the stock appeals procedure usually at 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases we have completed 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Yet still waiting in the office 81.500 objections to fulfillment.
Address it costs a lot
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO more than 1.4 million requests to brand protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the tenth consecutive year, the list of Neuanmeldungen all over the world, shares the authority with.
This applies also to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million.
2011 were 1.8 billion yuan in fees have been taken.
This means that any simplified registration on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Address it costs a lot more, as the case of the German company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the Group is fighting against a Chinese Plagiator.
While the Germans were able to ensure that its illegal production was mined imitation of German automotive industry.
But secured the counterfeiters to continue the Chinese rights to the brand name Freudenberg.
We have failed in Germany, as the family could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO dismissed the appeal of the Munich as well.
In the next two bodies Freudenberg got it right, but the fighting Prozessgegner still further.
It must be extremely
Now, the matter before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is confident that the thing to a successful conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were not quantify the Firmenarchiv have even one hundred years old files need to review the evidence.
Five years ago, the other side, Freudenberg in vain "with a" high rates to resolve.
"This shows how much this is worth," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East zurückzuschwappen even threaten to Europe.
That is, if they secure imitators vulnerable brands.
So did a Chinese manufacturer in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
In this area, the company has long since abandoned, however, he could turn the registration.
"We have to be careful," says Wentzler on the other.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch German companies to advise in dealings with China to be very careful.
It is not enough to turn to international trademark rights to leave the foreigners should somehow "everything that is worth protecting, even in China, as in" Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it will be much more expensive than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg in the last act of his Markendramas is, it should be the other side pay royalties for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be squeezed out of the market segment in question.

AIDS Day: Stamping, sing, help
The choir rehearsing in Heidelberg Imbongi - and in Swaziland rejoice Aidswaisen about it.
The story of a connection, the far more than 8733 kilometres.
First the stamping: The men, and Damenpumps Herrenslipper search on the parquet floor the beat, find him quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then the voices of the singer slowly - Alt, bass, tenor and soprano, harass and persecute, trick.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year anniversary conductor, it almost from its Stoffschuhen if it with his smooth wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg Imbongi the choir rehearsing a new song.
About fifty singers have come, between 23 and 69 years old, from the Humangenetikerin until Hausmann.
"Om 'Obani" is not an easy piece, every Chorstimme has a different text and those still in a very strange language: Zulu, the eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and parts of Swaziland.
Help themselves
Worldwide there are approximately 34 million HIV-, the estimates for UNAIDS, the programme of the United Nations to control of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 Aidswaisen live.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
In the village of 180 Aidswaisen Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa godfathers in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child fees, school uniforms and a hot meal every day in the Gogo-Center.
Imbongi means to Zulu storytellers or Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language fluently speak is no one in this space, but sing.
For nearly a decade, the chorus songs in this strange soft language and brings them back to where they originally come from: In the south of Africa.
As the crow flies from Heidelberg 8 733 kilometres away, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitjeni, that of the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some still in simple less limestone and net a large proportion of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents anymore because these the HI-virus.
In Esitjeni shows in miniature, which is quite Swaziland: Highest HIV-Infektionsrate lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Restrictions on the male foreskin that the risk of contagion is proven to reduce by half of the population, are not accepted.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland-bear the immunodeficiency virus in the middle, with thirty dying is not uncommon.
In a joint Africa-trip in the spring of 2005 discovered the chorus the village, but especially saw the Imbongis many children on the streets, which not only lack of parental care, but simply to everything: Food, clothing, education.
Without a school in a poor country is certainly no chance.
Initially, it was still the private commitment of individuals, for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", the since-almost professional to the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STI include syphilis, chlamydia and Tripper (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI are HIV, herpes, Humane Pappilomaviren both or hepatitis.
Crab and itch are among the parasite STI.
Who are the Hauptbetroffenengruppen?
Syphilis and Tripper, especially in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch-Institute-estimates that at least four of five all-in Germany reported syphilis cases through sexual contact between men.
With the heterosexual adults-Trichomonaden Chlamydia infections, Candidose (mushroom), Tripper and Humane Pappilomaviren common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is among heterosexual adults here - but comparatively low: About 20 percent of the HIV-new cases in this group.
Chlamydia infections are among the young-much more common than other groups.
According to European surveys three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
Here also come Humane Pappilomaviren among young people frequently.
How has the number of infections?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reporting obligation.
The number of syphilis-infections, according to the Robert Koch-des-Institute of disorders in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011 more than doubled.
The number of new cases of HIV-goes back since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth of less than a year earlier.
If the symptoms are to go?
The infectious diseases can genital ulcers, complaints, the discharge, hypogastric pain as well as vesicles or warts.
Often, however, they cause no pain or other symptoms and are therefore go unnoticed.
How can we protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but not 100% protection.
Because some of pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases, including through Schmierinfektionen and close physical contact.
Experts recommend that in particular when processing frequently changing Sexpartnern regular examinations.
Early diagnosed most STI can be cured and cosmetics.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the passion that the choir in Germany, some ersingt comes together.
"Overall, we have already around 200 000 euros after sent Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself Zodwa Dlamini, managed a confident and durchsetzungsstarke woman, the money from Germany.
It is also important that the orphans well, in one of the grandmothers around.
The Gogos how the old women in Zulu, are the linchpins of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in, give them a roof over their head and ensure that the children in their uniforms every day to school on time.
Anyone who has not come to the ski protection to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two cooks, every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" launched a Nähschule, two Hühnerhäuser built and, together with the American Health Organization PSI organized that many in the village have an HIV-test.
This is not a matter of course, so obviously the disease throughout the country is, says they are dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Really strange in a country in which the king officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch, King South Africa ’ s III, is known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to the officially sanctioned form of life, the HI-virus in recent decades has spread so quickly.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms if there were indeed on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but the rarely used.
Culture is a different - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote the cultural exchange, travels the Imbongi-choir every two or three years through the South Africa and sings songs full of wistfulness, fighting spirit, confidence and black assertiveness that many on the southern tip of the black continent even in times of apartheid.
A bus full of White, the songs in a black sing - so much recognition not only mood and joy, but has also been some fierce border guards a few tears abgetrotzt.
The journey will always after Esitjeni, where the singer their godchildren.
Even if the small village on maps little place, in the valley of the river-Ezulweni it is more than known.
"After Esitjeni goes, as is the light" say the people there.
And if the 8733 kilometres to Heidelberg, crow flies back to the pounding singers in the rehearsal room in the old city, you can see it as well.

Messenger: NASA discovers ice on the Mercury
The probe Messenger has proof that it is on the planet Mercury ice.
The ice sheet is possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The US-25 NASA has the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although he is closest to the sun, there are also frozen water, such as from three on Thursday in the magazine "Science" published studies have shown.
The probe Messenger have proof that there are constantly in the shadow of the region of the planet is an ice sheet.
This is to be at least 30 cm and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids, which may also on the Mercury are taken.
No one put the discovery of ice but with the existence of life on the planet in context, said the chief scientist of the Messenger-probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can measure up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help, such as water and other building blocks of life in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Erdenbürgern are probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix, in the depths of the universe.

Published by the European Southern Observatory image shows the several thousand light years away in the constellation Sagittarius-Trifid nebulae.
The name comes from the Latin word Trifid trifidus (divided into three sections, as dark Staubstreifen dreigespalten), the heart of the stars-birthplace dreiteilen.
As of 2005, astronomers have the harbingers of a cosmic carom photographed: 400 million light years from Earth, the cores are two verschmelzender galaxies to each other and are inevitably collide.

The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a part from the Irisnebel in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1,400 light years distant fog consists of Staubkörnchen, the ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This picture was taken from optical and Röntgen-recordings of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273, the Hubble space telescope for Nasa.
Scientists call the greater spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this Sternennebel is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.

Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope will 1608 by Hans Lipperhey invented before Galileo Galilei - be it a year later to the star.
Since then, the mirror of optical telescopes ever larger - and the insights that they provide, deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale-Telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego-the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five metres.
In Arizona, USA, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It is the same views into space on two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - alone is the mirror at 10.4 metres in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - in order to save money.
Nevertheless, he achieved a diameter of about 11 metres.
The favourable design: The telescope is in his elevation angle hanging - and thus in his agility.
Also the hobby-@-@ Eberly telescope in Texas is in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: The high Lichtsammelkraft.
This is - despite relatively low 3.5m - to the world ’ s largest Spiegelteleskope.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers to hear the space alien signals.
Members of the has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI)" anyone can help people by computing power.
Look at the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here, the Very Large Telescope - that his name.
With its four mirrors the telescope can also ausleuchten middle order.
Also on the Chilean ESO-observatory will be the European Extremely Large Telescope scheduled.
Primary should be a whopping 42 meters include - and from just under 1000 Spiegelelementen together.
With pictures, but until 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck-telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea as the largest in the world.
They offer two mirror with an average of 10 meters.
The Keck-telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea-optical-next to them with the Subaru-Telescope and the IRTTF in the sky.
Also at the summit of Mauna Kea is a new, huge telescope - with a mirror-average of 30 metres.
Here it is on an illustration.
The main impressions from space, the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it already provides images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler for extrasolar planets, particularly those which are to be inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011, the Nasa announced that 1235 Planetenkandidaten since Missionsbeginn.
In the picture are the last launch of the space telescope Kepler documented.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be on board a Ariane5 until 2018-rocket into space.
The primary of the Weltrauminfrarotteleskops has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is in light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scholars believe that at the South Pole of the Mercury ice exists.
However, there are no reliable data, as the Messenger far closer to the North Pole revolves around the planet.
For decades have Radarmessungen suggest that it is on the Mercury ice.
By the 2004-launched Messenger probe - the first, which revolves around the Mercury - have the scientists now certainty.

Daily butter drink - and 168 years old
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for durability.
Search for clues in the country where 97-year is still relatively young.
Many people in the south of Azerbaijan achieve a biblical high age.
There is even a museum for durability.
Search for clues in the country where 97-year is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch-mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus Brunei on the winding road, past densely wooded hills, rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one might think, you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here, the Caucasian ethnic Talyschen, not much is known, except that it perfectly Persian and Aserisch speaks and very durable.
Terminus is Lerik.
The small town with protzt to greedy wuchtig architecture from Soviet times, so do not fit in the picturesque mountain scenery.
Tourists come from Europe, hardly here too onerous, the directions from Azeri capital of Baku.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours because the road only single-lane.
The fabulous wealth, it owes its oil in the Caspian Sea, is here in the province has not yet arrived.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik this stuff on the tourist attraction.
"Baku was founded in May with the Eurovision-song-festival famous, and next year, we have here a festival of the oldest person in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita of about eight dozen Talyschen documented in the area more than 100. Fatulayeva shows a black-white-photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years begat another child
But controversial Star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, 168 years old.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And, in view of the oldest documented people of 122 years old, was Müslümovs age but extremely dubious.
"1805 he was born here in the region, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and have been 23 children, aged 136 years he fathered a daughter.
So has Şirali Müslümov at his age by a couple of decades will be charged?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, Altersforscher at the Max-Planck-Institute in Rostock, of the very elderly in Central Asia.
"Striking many hochaltrige people there are also in some areas of China-Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "also live in Sardinia extremely many very old men".
However, due to the lack of documentation is no scientific proof of age, especially to register.
Every day becherweise melted butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik striking an uncritical often age.
There are currently 20 persons that are more than 100 years old.
So why are living here in the south so many Hochbetagte?
The Azeri guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains the with the specific genes of Talyschen.
Museum Director Fatulayeva, in contrast, believes that the diet.
But that the kalorienreiche diet of Talyschen as healthy, the meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and many of them daily drink a glass of melted butter, is also beneficial from a nutritional point of view is not plausible.
Or is it the original way of life, the young people? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years it is for these latitudes is still relatively young.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have, 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a Butterfass they tirelessly herrollt back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one from Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are long grandparents.
Two small children jump around.
In the kitchen, there is the guests tea in the typical bauchförmigen Armadu-glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfect in and hides it under her headscarf, long, dunkelblonde braids who proudly unveiled her son before us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so they never went out and retained their color.
"Shampoo, I have never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She has always only the eaten, what of their own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I have not once in the supermarket food purchased.
Then she told her husband, who was in the army.
Worst of all, it was in the period following the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "beloved father Heydar" Aliyew took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds odd from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, driven by the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003, he was in power, his son Ilham later took over the helm.
After all, there is no hardship in Azerbaijan ’ s Old.
230 Al-Lat (about the same amount in euros), receives a monthly pension Mirzayeva for local conditions, the amount of which we can live well.
And perhaps has long Mirzayevas ergrauter son right: "The old enjoy in our culture respect."
They live in the midst of the extended family, loved and cared for, are happy.
If that is not a reason for as long as possible to stay alive

The word "human rights" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution is returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo, the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as the basis is controversial.
Egyptian President saved not with pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And that it is successful, is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was directed to all the people and, above all, probably to the Christian Copts, the Liberals, enlightened and secular Muslims.
For all of them, have been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile from graces the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said nearly entschuldigend Mohamed Morsi, the competences of the constitutional court temporarily curtailed and his powers, "in order to save the revolution."
But what of the 61-year old engineer, a PhD from the University of Southern California, really out to save, as the Egyptians, the world is not entirely clear.
Should the judicial process?
Indeed, the 234 items from the Islamist-dominated Constituent Assembly 100 köpfigen because in a nightly, 15-hour walkouts Parforceritt were rushed through, some worrying.
As in previous constitutions also means it in the draft, the jurisdiction based upon the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists the woolly formulation and the attendant legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a newly hinzugeführter article: In all the issues relating to the sharia should consult Al-Ashar-University, the country ’ s main Islamic institution with great power in the whole of Sunni Islam.
It must not, but it may mean that the clergy, which oversees the legislation is de facto the disenfranchisement of the judiciary.
Much in Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation
Also problematic: The civilian jurisdiction should continue to be preserved.
These dishes served during Mubarak ’ s rule to the repression of political opponents.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11,000 civilians in Militärhaft.
Governments should also, as stated in the draft, "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "protect their morals and promote its values."
This is legally formulated so vague that state institutions with the help of this article even the contents of cinema and literature to control.
In plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
Not incidentally, writes articles explicitly equality between men and women.
For another, prohibits the Prophet Mohammed and his envoy to insult or to slander.
But what an insult is and how it is to be punished, remains unclear.
The wording is also dubious, "insulting people" should be banned.
Is there has been a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of Leader?
Open to interpretation, as so much in the draft, the Morsi to signature and after his words "very soon" the Egyptians to the referendum will be presented.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition is taking shape for weeks against the excessive power of Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in an unusual concord on Friday evening at the-Tahrir Square in Cairo, and vowed to bring down the Charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, Drittplatzierter of presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and ex-head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei said, "the draft Constitution belong on the scrapheap of history."
He accused Via Kurznachrichtendienst Twitter followers Morsi ’ s, a "coup against democracy" to lead.
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and unseat him," said the opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politicians Chaled Ali.
And several justices said that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would be invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well organised Muslim Brotherhood blew the counter-demonstration, for its part, as a precaution but not on the Tahrir-place, but after a Massengebet on the other - before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and supporters of the Salafisten attended and called: "The people of calls for the application of God ’ s law."
They demanded that Morsi Säubere: "The country!" And my: "The Koran is our constitution."
A battle for control of the symbolic-Tahrir Square, where it all began, could have led to French.
This was clearly not risk Morsi supporters.
The Brothers said that both the opponents of the draft as well as the advocates had spoken loud and clear.
Now is the time, the people at the ballot box, to decide the direction in which the country should go.
A majority in favour of the draft Islamists is considered safe.
"The word rights, not even before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process that could have gone to the February and all the social forces should include.
The 48-year old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood under Mubarak, as they are in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their philosophy, but because of him, human rights are indivisible.
For this, he was beaten, imprisoned.
"And now, the word rights, not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "world" on Sunday.
Morsi Machtausweitung on all three powers in the state of the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules of play and Egypt in a new dictatorship.
"Instead of civil society, the President to strengthen them de facto suspended Saeda," complains.
But a democracy without civil society organisations could not work.
Saeda feels abandoned, also of the international community, which the ideological Richtungskampf on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement.
This might take revenge.

Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the übelriechendste fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy the highest living standards - and not only in Europe but all over the world.
The secret of success of the country could something with the local appetite for pretty nasty smelling fish have to do?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You place it in the middle of a pile of dirty, moist sportswear.
And leave it there a week.
That must be the smell of Rakfisk nasenbetäubenden, one of the great delicacies of Norway.
I find myself in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent aroma in the air, which just won ’ t go away.
Rakfisk is salt bestreute trout, which, depending on how you would like your fish stink - up to a year in water ferments.
If in the dark about the country and the weather gets colder Norwegians to flock here in Fagernes, that this, well, really very impressive speciality.
"You eat it raw and carries it with a glass of aquavit down", says Harvard Halvarsen, who works in the local fire station, but as a "General" also-Rakfisk festival.
Around us, people eat small Fischwürfel and take large amounts of alcohol.
"Mansche people like the aquavit more than the Rakfisk Amazing," says.
The spirit can crowd out the smell.
I go with some appetizers.
If it avoids the Rakfisk to bring in Nasennähe, he is not bad, like sushi, which is quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era when there was the first in the autumn and fish as watered Salzwasserfässern.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after a long fermentation and, no doubt, steamed senses - with the help of alcohol consumed.
Even a generation ago saw thousands of Norwegians in search of work, forced to leave their country and, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rivals, which not so long ago was much richer than Norway, flock to immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, albeit strictly are backed part of the Norwegian history.
He is one of the more expensive courts, which you can buy here.
But here is actually all expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often in the press, and most people this does not seem to care.
Here hates it, Anders Breivik still name - those racist extreme right, which last year 77 men, women and children.
Instead, it only refers to the "incident" on 22 July.
Norwegians find it difficult to accept that someone in their peaceful country to such brutal murders is capable of.
The main responsibility for today ’ s wealth of Norway is since the early 1970 ’ s growth is one of the largest oil and Gasindustrien in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, the round trays with seasoned Rakfisk distributed and with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are a, as they say, sensible people.
Her English is like that of most people here spotless.
We are not very angeberisch, we may not boasting.
Norway is dealt with very carefully with its oil wealth, a large part of the Branchenerträge is for the benefit of future generations in a special fund.
As in the years before the Great Depression cast all the money is that they do not, Norway had his wallet firmly closed.
"As long as we in the winter skiing and hiking can go in the summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And, of course," Rakfisk eat, it deals with easy laughter.
I stand in the snow, I am for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a moose-burger is definitely something different. The juicy meat I enjoy.
But in the evening the Stinkefisch is back on the menu.
The hotel, where I logiere, is one of several locations, the Rakfisk-organising a dinner, where guests for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish Geruchssinne can vote.
There is a Live-TV-circuit with fly to make television presenters, which is surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"You have the score up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
Here are our points, "Amazing".
To applause and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, may be overwhelmed by the Chinese.
But perhaps it is but the strict haze of the whole fish.

Mexico ’ s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a difficult start
While Mexico ’ s future President Enrique Pena Nieto on his taking office, Will Grant of the BBC analysed the challenges ahead of it and the mixed emotions of his people.
Currently, the traffic in Mexico-City especially bad.
Even on better days, this is a congested city, but on Monday, a ring of steel, the several important traffic routes into the capital absperrt and on the streets for chaos.
The goal was not, however, commuters on their way to work to disrupt, but demonstrators from Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico ’ s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Präsidentenbinde and the leadership of the nation.
He faces a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon ’ s, Mexico can economically well test, but the country is in the grip of a Drogenkriegs, who in the last six years, already 60,000 lives.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing the violence," Pena Nieto said earlier this week in the Oval Office to the US-American President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this objective.
Before joining with the US-president went on an equal footing, Pena Nieto as Governor of his Heimatstaats Mexico.
In this densely populated, part of the country, which surrounds the capital, are the opinions about the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town of Valle del Bravo is remembered, for example, rely on him.
Inhabitants of the resort of write him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
In order to reach the city, you can go to one of the motorways, Pena Nieto and build a great improvement on the fragile, bumpy roads, which gave it here.
Plaques with his name also depend on the outside of a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him real and lasting change", as his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who as a congressman for the party, the PRI Pena Nietos works.
In particular, as regards the security and the economy is concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that the party after 12 years outside capture of the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
The allegations of the opposition, the new president lacks substance, he rejects.
He was a very direct man, very committed and have big plans for the country.
He was a great statesman, especially if he but also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, many people do not share this view of their former governor.
In formalized, also known as Ciudad Neza, could the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo not be greater.
The place is hidden under Autobahnüberführungen and is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico-City itself.
And the problems are crucial in the municipality of urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military switched to the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and to combat violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a stains Barrens near a large landfill were in the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women left behind.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto were in the state of Mexico, about 1,000 women murdered - a statistic that even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which for their violence and the murders of innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos are of the opinion that he is the problem of the murders of women during his tenure at least not properly.
But, in the worst case have his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a Betonbau, typical of the old quarter, Irinea Buendia with tears when she me photos of their deceased daughter Mariana Luna shows.
The official version of events, Mariana 2010 committed suicide.
But their family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her door, it seemed as if their bodies washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the Leichenstarre had already used.
While their mother recounts their history, looks out from the wall, a picture of Mariana on us. It is next to a cross, a single word: Justice.
But it is precisely this, so the family, have denied them until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a Schwätzerin, Unruhestifterin, Nörglerin.
They want to simply accept their verdict and the mouth.
"But that is not possible, if it so many flaws and failings," she says.
If President Pena Nieto on Saturday the Präsidentenbinde, he is also a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families were in the last six years of violent crime suffered, and the new president has promised during his term, especially with this problem.
"I hope that as president he is as it was as governor," says the PRI congressmen Olvera-in Valle del Bravo.
But, just afraid of the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza most.

The prosecution claims: Bradley Manning did not complained of mistreatment
Bradley Mannings contradicts the prosecution allegations that he had been mistreated in prison
The hearing deals with the Mannings Militärgefängnis in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the indictment in too harsh prison conditions
The condition of the US-army is accused of thousands of classified documents to have stolen
Prosecutors on Friday, has tried to establish that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - indicted for the biggest disclosure of confidential information of the US-American history - missed several opportunities to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in Militärhaft to complain.
At a third: Mannings during a hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, said Maj. Ashden Fein that documents to weekly visits, the Mannings prison officers during a period of detention in Quantico, Virginia, no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the third, the following a request from the defence to reject the charge, Manning was held by the harsh detention - had already been punished enough Manning testified that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The Geheimdienstanalyst of US-army, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of serving in Iraq, while thousands of classified documents.
The material was published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never Manning as the source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein with Manning the forms, the officials after their meeting with Manning during his imprisonment in the Quantico-Militärgefängnis had filled from July 2010 to April 2011 she had increased prison conditions.
The officials, Manning questions and wrote his answers.
As Fein him on Friday to the forms, that he gave Manning to the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole as "very professional" had judged.
The forms, so Fein contained no complaints about abuse, although the official Manning directly to his treatment had consulted.
Manning replied that he had his concerns expressed orally and the officials had discussed this with him and to deal with these. They are not, however, have been recorded.
"They wrote (after meeting the reservations)" No problems ", and not necessarily that meant that I absolutely nothing," Manning said.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, Manning also asked why he is not complaining about his treatment, in January 2011 with a committee, which met him a few months previously referred to a form Suizidgedanken.
Manning answered during this meeting, his intention had been to his Beobachtungsstatus "prevention of injury" to begin by downgrading.
The military said that it had him from this restrictive status - a level below the Selbstmordgefährdung - to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince people that I went well, and on the prevention of injury Beobachtungsstatus (...) in order to get rid of a higher quality of life, in my view, to achieve," Manning said.
Manning said on Thursday to his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he nearly two months before he was detained in July 2010 in the prison of the next Quantico in Virginia.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and was due to the heat even unconscious.
Not to know what happened to him or in the outside world, would be burdensome.
"My world shrank at Camp Arafjon, on these cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in the cage.
When he was moved to Quantico Manning did most of his days in a small cell - spent at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
We only have a mattress, a blanket, flip-Flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he had tried to remain in motion, because the day whether it is forbidden to sleep, or even just lie down.
He always have to sleep with light from the outside in his cell.
If he turned up at night and guards his face, I have not seen him so that he can be used again zurückdreht.
In January 2011, Mannings lawyer Mannings formally objected to the treatment.
In April 2011, Manning in the Militärgefängnis of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked to an accusation that he collected in his statement on Thursday, so he had a night naked in his cell in Quantico sleep and a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had during this counting never had the opportunity to meet with his blanket.
In the survey on Friday, Manning, he had a command of his guard down from the ceiling, he would have been able to cover drop. He should, however, that no one had asked him.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had in the previous night was forced to sleep naked. He had previously tried to show a officials that he poses no risk to themselves.
Manning told the officials said that he would have the waistband of his underwear or his flip-Flops can use to themselves, but this is not done.
That night, Manning said, are his underwear, flip-Flops and glasses removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge and his Hafterlebnisse at least be drastically reduce Haftmaß, he should be at his trial before the military tribunal. This is scheduled for early next year.
The defence has stated that Manning is minor offences committed guilty, while other charges, which will be seen as too extreme to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. From the prosecutor will be a justification of the detention conditions expected.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions for all among the highest security measures in Quantico stored prisoners.
Among the charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, the transfer of national Verteidigungsinformationen and the theft of public property or documents.
He is found guilty in all of the charges he is facing a life sentence.

My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are due to the lack of opportunities, forced to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they call them in hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico-City, I had just crossed the hall and was at the passport control, when perplexity in me.
Signs pointed to two queues: One for "Wochos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, insecure, to which I should go.
I am in Zentralkalifornien grew up and became my whole life "Mexicans called".
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston "Irish" or my friends in New York "Italians call".
Later, I opted for "Mexican-Amerikanisch."
But it was here Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfather, there was no need for acronyms or hyphens.
I was just Americans.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough for me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a Muttersprachlers, and my American accent, I am also not going.
So I took my American passport and put me in the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about the moment this week, when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House in order to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda of all those issues which we expect if the heads of these two countries: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very keen on the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason that Mexicans today, with a high probability remain in Mexico, instead of emigrating to the United States.
He would like to deal with the United States and Canada and a North American trade bloc in the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed that the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, even if he was no details.
Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never wasting a single thought that the United States invaded in 1848 in Mexico and the leadership of the country under vorgehaltenem rifle, forced them to more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans in centuries and not in minutes, are reminders of this event.
Therefore, once a US-government officials also only Pit criticism of Mexico, we hear, in the Mexican press and among the elite of the country - complaints about how the Americans afflict the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And the children go to Montezumas.
And yet, the biggest challenge of Mexico in truth in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People, for the land of opportunity, and others, for which it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican origin in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix and San Antonio live, is that at one point in our family tree, a person may be a parent or Großelternteil - no chance in Mexico and offered immigrated in the north.
And in most cases, this person was a profile - folks, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may be living the American dream, good schools and good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that the American dream is that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes perhaps vague, but what our loyalty is concerned, this is not the case.
This is clearly the United States.
We are also aware that there are not many members of the Mexican ruling class.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memento of a humiliating defeat and look down on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
Their view is our very existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families in Mexico have failed, though they were not.
And then we would not now see trapped behind the Seidenvorhang - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally in the United States had slipped, reminds me that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are, and Mexican Americans take this resent them.
While US-American citizen, sees it as part of the two countries.
But many Mexican Americans that I know have the feeling that neither one nor the other country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but in none of them.
In Mexico, we will be seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we will be seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that this relationship is more complicated: Some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie would resume their links to the diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans as a provisional "ambassador" for Mexico, which use their interests in the United States.
We are supposed to our American colleagues tell you how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Now.
This will not happen.
Too many wounded feelings.
And, in view of the unfair income distribution, rampant corruption and the drug-related violence, many of us are not so sure if it is really a great country.
I fear that you alone, Amigos.
This is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States to deal with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans a grudge kings, as their family members only, not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are "Mexican" than I thought.

Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could be unexpected cornerstone for peace
Is it ever lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem such a hope in the bud.
In the midst of the usual apportioning blame, countless buildings to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza, near the Israeli city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while the Israelis and Palestinians trapped in their historical conflict, is changing the Middle East around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are part of this mayhem.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate may find their end.
A war that is not yet lost
At first blush, optimism, given the current situation is not appropriate.
Even if the on 21 November have agreed ceasefire continues, this fighting the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim that the Israelis have pushed back, although his group even large losses.
Although several Hamas-leader killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip in one of the desolatesten and densely packed bevölkertesten corners of the planet, it is Israel until now has not managed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas in the West Bank, that of the rival, moderate Palästinensergruppe Fatah is controlled.
And the Hamas-leader could come to the conclusion that they have time on their side.
As Islamists in the Arab world has grown in influence Hamas have powerful and wealthy friends on their side.
Turkey, a wiedererstarkende, regional power that once was seen as Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally, has taken to the Hamas party - just as Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubelnde Hamas-followers believe that Israel is an Islamist Crescent - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has the power over Syria, where rebels an increasingly islamistischeren characteristics before the Stürzung Bashar Assad could be up to Jordan, where Hamas-allies the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt under President Muhammad Morsi, the single Germany's most densely populated districts and most important Arab country, on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot of Egypt until his fall 2011 30 years, only had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood with Hamas and its leaders more verschwägert Volksansichten.
In future diplomatic negotiations could be Hamas as a player, even from Israel and the United States can not excluded.
Israeli hardliners, however, can be an opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no more.
The Israeli missile defence system, "Iron Dome", has been able to test and many of the Hamas-missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel is a quiet sleep.
Diplomatic believe the United States unshaken by its position, many European countries have Hamas blamed for the latest escalation.
Israel is there in recent years, particularly under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, the peace process has been largely ignored.
Although rockets from the Gaza strip-since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelis, the country is still relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the control in the West Bank, and thus in the body of any Palestinian state hineinverlaufen. These protect the Jewish settlements, which is in breach of international law, but always have been declared to be developed further.
Netanyahu is well-. His Likud Party, ahead of the elections on January 22, under Avigdor Lieberman with an even kämpferischeren group.
Why this cunning Palestinians nanny and leave them to their own state?
If they actually have control over the West Bank, would it not just as their supporters also fire rockets in Gaza?
No, it is better that they are behind the wall at bay and punish, should they dare to raise the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners. However, the Arab Spring could thwart them.
Even if the Islamists who now in Egypt and other countries in power, little left for Israel, they will first on the difficulties in their own country.
The taken Israel ’ s is larger than that of his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local superpower is hardly the new Arab governments in the overhaul of its economy.
The pragmatic President Morsi with Barack Obama to oust a ceasefire may be a promising sign - and perhaps the beginning of a new era.
Even the Israelis should think long term.
While the rest of the Arab world, timid steps in the direction of democratisation that Palestinians will continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg, which no doubt one day explode in the Israeli occupied territories, just as this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
Already the repression is undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions to reduce Hamas in the Gaza strip-over the years are increasingly its diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from outside
The right answer is one of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and is represented by this newspaper: Two states, in which Israel areas for security purposes.
The - for the near future small - hope is that the ceasefire outsiders greater influence on the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must now share with Turkey and Qatar, the supply of arms in the Gaza strip-stop and is better placed than ever before to Hamas from the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by Gebietstausch and a shared Jerusalem.
Outsiders Arab nations should also Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
That would be more for the creation of a Palestinian state as done with the forthcoming application for UN-observer status.
Obama, too, must do its part to persuade Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems as if he were as much a part of the Choir.
But this is a regrettable, shortsighted perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Australian laws in force for single cigarette
Health warnings and infected body parts on neutral green packs, which are the same for all promoted
The world ’ s first laws for single cigarette and Tabakverpackungen are in Australia, which will come into force brand logo and colours, replaced by neutral olive lid, moreover, with dramatic images printed sick body parts, and by cigarette smoke infected infants and children.
Of the various health warnings and frames apart from next Saturday is the only difference between the packs in the brand names, printed in identical, smaller font.
Australia is the world ’ s most stringent rules for Tabakverpackungen.
The Australian Federal Government wants to young people smoking, by the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
This is the government of studies that have shown that people who have not started with 26, to smoke, with 99% probability that will not start.
"One can already see young age in children that they understand the message, the tobacco companies with their brand of trying" to apply, so Bundesgesundheitsministerin Tanya Plibersek. They cited studies that have shown that children, for example, the crown logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia Raucherquoten is one of the lowest in the world, and the changes only slightly at the profits of the multinationals, other countries will have similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
So, with the laws of the fighting, which would benefit to cheaper and more readily accessible cigarettes.
"The law will lead to serious, unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters are far greater amounts of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the legislation boosting their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico import Pty Ltd, a small family businesses, notes that the demand for Zigarettenetuis and Silikondeckeln to cover the unbearable packaging, has grown enormously since the trusts, British American Tobacco, Britain 's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago at the top Australian court with their dispute the laws failed.
Zico have up to 6,000 units sold to wholesalers and await new stocks.
For us this is a good deal.
According to the experts, the hooks in the popularity of social media in the community, in which the plan.
A number of Australian laws, tobacco companies from the TV-banned from advertising, they act as Sportsponsoren and most traders forced in shops are no longer cigarettes. Now is the tobacco advertising on the Internet.
The Australian government has advertising banned by local businesses and pages, but it has no influence on international sides.
"Whoever tobacco markets and has only a small area, in order to promote its products to the Internet is not around," says Becky Freeman, a researcher in health care at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman an increase in reports about brands noted that "normal people".
It has to be asked: Is this merely a private person who likes this big-Marlboro cigarettes place that it even includes a video - or has a marketing-agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry rather than on marketing focusing on the new laws.
It has even gone so far as Ukraine, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, in order to pay for the new rules - those countries to complain to the World Trade Organisation about unfair Handelseinschränkungen, although none of the countries greater trade in Australia.
A WTO-decision is expected in 2013.
According to Plibersek, the government talks with other countries who are considering similar Verpackungsgesetze.
Canada was the first country in 2001, the photographic warnings.
These have now been in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are proudly.
The images do not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"You simply take a turn and the box away," says Victor El Hage, when buying a packet of cigarettes on the printed a photo with a Mundtumor.
To be honest, there is only one reason why I would cease, and this is my little girl.

In a constantly elektrisierten world it is beautiful, even to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport, as our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
I had enough time to me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
Half a day at the airport on a flight to wait is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and, of course, steuerfreies Shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and lead Kindesentwicklungsexperten boredom as something positive.
So far as they are concerned, it is for us, and our children - okay, sometimes to be bored.
This is the brain, forced into interesting thoughts to lose the creativity.
And because most of us today is almost constantly on the one or other screen rigid, are no longer the benefits of boredom.
The boredom, so we should welcome with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back again.
Like many people, I am always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon, with increasing leisure has developed.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), the not so.
"Indeed, the boredom has a very long history", he says.
Pompejis adorns the walls, a Latin graffiti on boredom, which dates back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we define boredom, actually.
John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the problem is that boredom in many ways is defined and discussed.
After a long reading of literature and the presentation of the idea of a Fokusgruppe of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom than the experience, "a satisfactory activity, but not to want to be able to define".
Boredom is different from apathy that that the person is not considered, but would like to be.
At the apathy, on the other hand, there is no desire to do something.
The Schlüsselerfahrung of boredom, he says, is to "disruption of the Aufmerksamkeitsprozesses, coupled with a bad temper and the sense that the time passes slowly."
Boredom is almost as such as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, even though these two conditions related to bored people could see the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that we have is boring, even if we just have difficulties to us.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - used to: "The idle mind: The definition of boredom from the point of view of attention" that "in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" appeared, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues at an earlier experiment, in which participants a band, a person who listened to read a Magazinartikel.
Some groups have heard a loud TV from the neighbouring area, which has nothing to do with the content. Other heard it to lower volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group these noises do not hear them.
The people who heard the barely audible television, said, more boring than the other two groups - feel they have had problems to concentrate, for they could find no reason and wrote its difficulties of boredom.
If you try to focus on a difficult and arduous task to focus the attention of the disorder can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If, on the other hand, a monotonous work - "as the search for faulty products on a Fabrikförderband can distract, music and help to feel not bored."
In fact, he says, we know now that Herumzappeln and Kritzeln, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, even by people can combat physically attentive remain.
"Studies have shown that children who must herumhampeln learn more and more information than those who are forced to sitting still," Professor Fenske.
We will all eventually boring - my delayed flight, a dröhnender speakers, a particularly tedious film.
But some people bore more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers have developed in the 1980s to Langeweileanfälligkeit a "scale".
On the scale, you will find statements such as "Many things that I must do repeat themselves and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything."
With the help of such scales, researchers found that boys more boring than girls, as Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular, regarding the need for more and a wider range of external stimuli.
But teenagers are generally a pretty abgespannter bunch.
In 1991 led Reed Larson, professor of human and Gemeinwesensentwicklung at the University of Illinois, an experiment in which he almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager contacted.
He found that 32% of adolescents in the school and the comes from doing the homework were bored, while 23% said that to be bored if they were not in school.
But only 3% of parents said, is to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentages in terms of boredom increased or decreased.
It is certain, however, that "the youth is perceived as very boring," mainly because children and teenagers have no major impact on their Alltagsablauf.
Back to my Ursprungsfrage: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in the extreme case leads them to that people extreme physical risks and gambling, or drugs to relieve studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, of the issue for more than two decades.
"With the boredom wants the brain a say that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain knows what you are not always the best should do.
If a boring and it is this energy used to playing guitar and to cook, will be happy.
But television can for happiness in the short term, but in the long term they dissipate.
Whoever his bored child, then, an iPad, it can while away from the boredom, and it has not learned to entertain themselves or to control, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self is transferred from one situation to the other."
The child learns not just to entertain, but also in other areas receive more self.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not to take a critical view of them.
Instead, our aim should be to us away from the ongoing activities and Technologieberieselung structure.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as we should be more boring, but boredom is the nagging, relentless desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that the people of truth just look for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly überstimuliert, it is difficult to deal with, if the noise even has fallen silent."

In Colorado, there is no clear guidance for the new Marihuanagesetz
The 19-year old community college-student and footballer Anthony Orozco is in southeast Colorado on trial for a crime in this state, which soon will be legally: The possession of a few Marihuanabrocken and a pipe with which he smoked.
Orozco said he and some friends were in it with a car in Lamar, close to the border with Kansas, when they were stopped.
After the police officers had found marijuana in the car, Orozco for possession of drugs and summoned Drogenutensilien - excusable, each with a fine of 100 US-dollar are provided, and received a court hearing.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco.
But he is also a?
In the uncertain weeks after the decision of the state, small quantities to legalise marijuana for personal use, is the answer in hundreds of smaller takes less than the law on location.
Hundreds of offences, which are to be marijuana, here and in the state of Washington, who dropped similar measures that have already been approved.
The police authorities are pursuing adults over 21 years ago no longer for possession in a small extent. This is legally allowed, as soon as the new laws in the weeks to come into force.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced, existing Marihuanadelikte and quote still people in court.
At the same time, several cities, to vote in favour of the suburbs Denvers up to the Western Mountains about new, state licensed Marihuanageschäfte at the opening in their communities.
"This situation is developing so rapidly that I do not even know what will happen next," says Daniel J. (, police chief in Aurora, the east of Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington scratch themselves perplexed at the head.
They are waiting for a guide to establish a licensing systems for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of December 1, 2013.
In Washington, it is of the opinion that Colorado in any case is ahead of the majority of States, which concerns the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was only for medical purposes and then to the Eigenkonsum legalised.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore right to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the supervisory authority for spirits in the state of Washington.
But Smith is there to that no place or system can do more than in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent, which we can follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, on 6 December in force and the conclusion of a grey area, in which the state licensing system still does not exist, but the property is legalized.
And unpleasant Praxisfragen must be resolved in this time, about how the government target of a "fair access to" which marijuana with the ban on Cannabisgeschäften within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities should be agreed.
"There will be no more difficult, a site for a licensed Cannabisgeschäft than in urban areas, particularly in the area of Seattle", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the "Center for Legal cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief (his staff in Aurora a E-Mail, in which he said that the prosecutor would smaller Marihuanadelikte in people over 21 years ago no longer, and that the police are now "no" to get for this offence.
Chief (added that the police continue to urban targets for regulation of growers of medical marijuana will continue to enforce and drug traffickers.
In WELD County in northern Colorado Bezirksstaatsanwalt Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he admitted that his agency would continue to pursue cases of Marihuanabesitz, mainly to consumers for withdrawing.
Currently, 119 people for the possession of about 50 grams or less marijuana on trial, although many also for other offences were charged.
"Our agency has the duty to prosecute offences, which are to Tatzeitpunkt crimes was," Buck said in a statement.
The reactions, even in places like the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana-initiative, ambivalent.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest town of the district, shows adults for the possession of small amounts of no longer.
Pete Bezirksstaatsanwalt Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to abandon all outstanding Besitzverfahren.
"I do not believe that I don ’ t waste my time to enforce the law, until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado, supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy, the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions in the whole state under local officials encouraged a profound dichotomy in relation to the big green experiment.
At Bezirksstaatsanwälten if it were a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver to Marihuanadelikte represents the defendants in court and on the ground as a spokesman for the national organisation on the reform of Marihuanagesetzen.
"They have such a large part of their lives spent to prosecute people for the legalization still cannot accept", he believes.
The first states that small amounts of marijuana, such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national test-cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials to an era of legal sales, they also prepare waiting nervously on orders of the federal government, which the sale and the cultivation of marijuana at the federal level remains a criminal offence.
Advocates of the Legalisierungsbewegung hope that the justice ministry will give in.
Despite several spectacular arrests of consumer and medical marijuana sellers of the Federal Government has launched the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drugs policy-adviser of the Obama-government believes that investigators are probably no doors in order to seize small quantities of drugs, but are likely to resist under the new legislation legal, regulated marijuana-shops to tolerate.
Several cities in Colorado are not even that the federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local municipalities approved moratoriums on new marijuana-shops, although this only open in about a year.
Montrose decided last week, a city in the West, a six-month ban, the likely next week.
"We do not want to end up in a position in which we license and then someone at the federal level have a huge problem", as Bob Nicholson, a member of the council.
Our community has voted against this change in the law.
We then, for what the municipality decided and not afterwards, for which the state.
Still, many questions unanswered.

Petronella Wyatt from Oxford: I was bullied because I am Tory
Students of today not only for their views are attacked
It has always been my greatest dreams, a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had those University, which I once for the largest Wissenstempel in the world, for a modern Greek symposium that the great pillars of civilisation - free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks after my arrival in Worscester College in the late 1980s, where I had intended to study, history, I had my suitcase packed again and so the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard, I would be misplaced, because I would have had a problem with that peers in neighboring rooms sex.
The author of A N Wilson explained these, I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran because I suffered from systematic harassment and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
We had asked for one reason only harassed - a reason, in this alleged cradle of enlightenment so parochial and cruel seemed: My now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt was a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I have been a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, current reportedly suffers from a new generation of students of the moderate right under similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory-students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions, that a group of them last week called for the same Gleichberechtigungsschutz, the gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College, it will be because of their political views often "actively isolated, personally and for declared undesirable."
They are calling for a place in the Gleichberechtigungskomitee their College, in order to ensure that their opinions freely can be expressed.
Their situation has been exacerbated by a recent documentary about broadcasting political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", the Tories as eccentrics and neoNazis.
It has been shown, among other things, an alumnus Joe Cooke, a former president of the conservative student union of the University of Oxford in a Rolls-Royce and with silver suit and silberbesetztem prelude walking stick.
At other universities say conservative students, they are called "scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year old Luke Black, vice president of the conservative ’ at the University of Nottingham in a Sunday newspaper, said: "There is a growing Linkstendenz at universities.
The people believe that we are like the Bullingdon Club, without us on Fridays at all. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 and Geschichtsstudent in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, is of the opinion that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the conservative student association of Oxford says she at JCR-members a growing opposition to students of the moderate right.
"This is a danger to the intellectual debate and for the wellbeing of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford I was such a minority.
As incredibly shy 18-year I was in September 1986 arrived.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its climax.
Last year, the university had voted in favour, Margaret Thatcher, a former student, because of cuts in higher education no title.
The atmosphere would frighten even Stalinists.
In the first days of the incoming-week, in the new students and tutors, I received a foretaste of future events.
I made the experience that the tutors the mockery of Tory-students not only did it, but even with joy.
Political issues, such as the office, privatisation and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime-South Africa found their way into the rooms of the native Tutoriums.
In the first of these events should I French texts from the 18th century into English. For what will come, I should not have been taken.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a small man with a face like from Kuchenteig, and quite me.
"Refuse Thatcher-followers, French to learn, or are they just stupid?" He asked me.
The other students kicherten.
Wallten tears in my eyes.
"I propose that in your free time you take a few Französischstunden - so if you are not too much with your social activities are busy," growled at intervals me Pitt.
I returned with hängendem head in my room.
On this evening in college, I was sitting alone at the dinner, as I typed someone lightly on the shoulder.
It was a Englischstudent from the second year named James, who is a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone who is suspected of Tory, will be harassed.
For me, it is bad enough, but you know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most incoming Tory-give-, supporters of the Labour Party.
In a local pub I tried later on.
I insisted that I do not agree with everything with Mrs. Thatcher was of the same opinion.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A university entrants in philosophy, politics and economy, ironically, the current Eton College as a conservative, said to me: "You are the daughter of a Faschistenschweins."
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
"How did Tories sex?" Asked me one.
The beat, or each other?
I felt so how homosexuals from the more liberal legislation of the United States had to have felt.
Would I ever succeed at Oxford University to lead a normal life?
I would cost only after nightfall?
If I am the Labour-party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me lay, gradually, before my inner eye to a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor, who is openly as a Tory, was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history, which has its headquarters in my college.
He was not only for it to be hated, a conservative, but also because he Thatcher in terms of foreign policy speeches and had written for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincial and narrow and rejected him for being an-deterministic Geschichtsperspektive.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
I started between Oxford and the house of my parents to commute and found refuge in outward-looking friends and family members in the city.
My father told me that I hated it, and why I did it.
He seemed disbelief.
During his time in the 40s were all political views.
"But it is the best place in the world", he said sheepishly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming spire.
Even my communist friends always perfect manners laid on the day.
Tarnished his moist eyes.
Give it a chance.
I am sure that you just teased.
I would, if you break the hearts of gingst.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory-supporters, had bowed to pressure and reclaim his convictions.
During a Tutoriums the following week, where another Geschichtstutor seriously had claimed that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly zerging in shame, I gave my parents to that of "brainwashing" to "old sucker and called them".
Facilitating lasted only briefly.
It was my father, the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford-career.
At that time, he wrote a week two columns in the Murdoch-press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave my Häscher.
As they went, I took a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weinerlichen Schlappschwanz.
But no 18-year should ever in an educational institution under such intimidation and evil.
And even tragic is that it was a University of Oxford, who not only 14 Tory-Prime Minister, but until now behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino attracts elegance of the celebrity before"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC with Naty Abascal, Mrs Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian Modemachers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, an exhibition about the accommodation is worthy of Valentino Garavani.
This, the designer at the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture" acknowledged, a grandiose retrospective, for the more than 130 garments of haute couture, which were compiled by his "Maison" in the past 50 years.
"I love this Palace", he says, with its distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose sole protagonist "il signore" Garavani is, but not without its distinguierte clientele would have to be written.
Valentino had always had a fascination with the stifling and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of this exhibition, which until March 3 will be on display, there are a number of private letters and photographs with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, starting from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan, on the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from the modest by Voghera in the city in northern Italy to the idol of the international entertainment world.
In love with the nobility, must not be a disadvantage.
"At least they enter their tipping is not on your beautiful carpet, as some beautiful celebrities do from the pop music", says Baroness Mrs Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, spacious and elegant host.
"All of us, if we were to his house in Gstaad were invited," explains the addition of "asked" Thyssen, chummy with forgotten beauties such as Marella founded Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the celebrity.
And yet, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also, the Argentine model Valeria Mazza forgets the charisma of the Modemachers not.
Many years ago we went for a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome to him home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, on food and music, and you sensed his influence.
"All the guests felt important and loved," recalls the "top-model" that her career in the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion because its design works of art," she says.
Fashion show of origin
The lives of Garavani is not a story of Versessenheit, more of mutual love affairs.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was in a glorious and 60 metres long catwalk, the one of roles: The user takes the place of the model and the catwalk, a magnificent "audience" to admire the masterpieces of Valentino, such as, for example, the dress, the Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes, the Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather, the Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from Modepuppen radiate names like the Sibilla en portadora, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Abascal and by Naty, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable."
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, waistcoat type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter collection-1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to all the other because of his great love for the women and because it highlights our beauty,", adds the Ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors, which he uses, very; they have plenty of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Meinungsführende in the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d 'Arenberg can not forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of the age, and to have the opportunity to wear one of his dresses,...
At the end of the 1990s, there was finally.
I bought my first Valentino-dress for a celebration in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a aloft bodice with a neckline that his name.
"It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigo d 'Arenberg.
"Valentino does not depend on the fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian Aristokratin between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess D 'Arenberg preserves its cocktail of Modemachers "with the utmost care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with them."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 Ragazze "(as the" by his seamstresses called) were necessary to make this Ivory silk gown with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four and a half metres long tail.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority in the trade press, the dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society."
For years with the "savoir-tempered" of the elite, with Valentino now is their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l 'Hôpital des Invalides ’ des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, cumulative Garavani so many honors, as each of the husbands of its customers.
"I am always be refinement, his calm, his neat and perfect exterior noticed" Arenberg, D '.
The last time I saw him a month ago at a gala-dinners at the Museum of Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was spotless; the time leaves no trace of him."
And it says a princess...

The hardest job in the world: The human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the winner of the Indonesian volcano their lives and their health at risk if they 70 kilos of brimstone on the steep, rocky paths.
There are people, for their work, and the hell is other work quite literally in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miner who earn their lives by using sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day he must go down to the bottom of the crater, where the advance of the sulphurous gas from the earth in contact with the air.
After he has extracted large Schwefelsteine, which can weigh up to 70 pounds, he transported them into two Bambuskörben on his shoulders on the slope of the paths of stone.
There are only 250 meters from the top of the volcano, which is up to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes for the rise in Schildkrötentempo, while the balance and the steps have to be careful, so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step you can kill a French tourist, as it happened, the years ago on the steep slopes of the Kawah Ijen plummeted.
The miner of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur, which reduce them.
On top of the hill, they pave the path between the tourists who like Zirkusaffen photograph them and run with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometres to the scales that are a Minengesellschaft a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters has set up
The company is PT sweet Ngrimbi since 1960, the deposits in the volcano and (never better) said its workers, whom they 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulphur is charged.
It sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral in everyday life is widespread and for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to the bleaching of sugar is used.
"As we normally wear 70 kg, we get to any way about psychiatry rupees (3.8 euros)," explains us Anto, usually three routes on the day.
For each track it requires three hours that he is completely managed, at the end of the day, he then 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros).
What looks like a lousy pay for such an almost inhuman effort, but it is three times as much as he deserves to be in the fields.
"The Tagelohn here, where the miners in the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day will be paid and the average monthly income two million rupees (167), is very high," explains the carrier, as bricklayers on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75 000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, returned, and for a reason, in Indonesia as important as the sulphur is: "I have a girl from Bali, where they are married Hindus, and I have brought them to Java, to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, and his eyes are often a coughing fit because of the toxic gases irritated.
The 27 year old Anto has been three years of his life in the Kawah Ijen at risk, whose sulphur at the first mark him, even though he has left his face with a mask and Spezialbrille.
Anto has asthma, breathes a coughing fit with difficulty, and his eyes are often due to the poisonous gases from the volcano irritated.
This is the price he paid for the achievement of his dream.
"I will have two years of work, because I have a shop or Spanish or French would like to learn," he promises in a more than reasonable English.
This likeable and smart, but from life gestrafte young man could be a tourist guide, waiters or at the reception desk of a hotel, but instead he performed the work of a Tragesels.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other agencies and every morning at 2 p.m. at night, because the sulfur also means, where his distinctive yellow color turn in the darkness.
The shadow of challenging, it rises in the light of a small, on his helmet, which he bought from his own money into the crater.
About 400 carriers can download on Kraterboden the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite their large profits, the Minengesellschaft the Schwefelabbau mechanized, not in order to cut costs and returns the providers that are working on their own account and paid by weight, no equipment.
You also get a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, the guardians of this nature parks along with the entrance fee in the amount of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists, the demand for photographing of the volcano and human Tragesel.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people protesting" Madrusin, a cobby, 42 years old carrier, the three decades since leaving the school on Kawah Ijen works.

Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Blame the Singapurer to ensure that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the cost of real estate and bringing up children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: We fulfil our released and we create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless, or precisely because of this, they were at the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper-songs, the local slogans such as "pushing will be a" good "(loaf) in the oven to the low birth rate in Singapore to make fun.
The advertising agency BBH, who shot the video, respects the hope that the advert in a funny way, to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wants to use the power of the music, the people wanted to implement its "national duty."
This is something only for Internet, we therefore had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When propagated, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we get to grips with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as the marketing of perfume with or under the organisation of speed-dating-evenings (fast flirting).
It is possible that many of these ideas were led creative, but not necessarily to success.
Therefore we thought: Why do we not something as creatively as possible, in order to address this problem, for example, how to compose a rap?
1.2 children
If this issue is not easy, the Government of Singapore.
Every year they 1,300 US-dollar for political action in order to encourage more people to have children.
A package of government for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extended maternity leave and distributed tax advantages.
But everything has had little success.
Singapore is a richer, more city state in the southeast of Asia, also for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls is known.
According to his national Bevölkerungsbehörde, the birth rate is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time these rate was about 2 - which is also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why get the Singapurer no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director for marriage and family policy of national Bevölkerungsbehörde, says that this in a "better training" and "greater opportunities."
"This has the people except to marry and to form a family far more options in terms of goals and priorities," she says.
These changes in the social realities have higher number of single parents and the delay of the marriage and births, the result of which contributed to the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy that led to a dramatic increase in the influx, in order to counter the reduction of the population to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where the little laminated xenophobia against many new immigrants flourishes, especially against the Chinese, who are criticised for that they keep wages down and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is seen as one of the reasons that the ruling party in Singapore last year boxes since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt to the problem with higher contributions and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the known impact on the economic growth of a nation that tax revenues, the health costs and the immigration policy, Singapore has also unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small flats are being built.
She also has an impact on the housing market.
The authority for urban development has begun, the number of small apartments to control, which are known as "Schuhschachteln" and built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great success in terms of sales.
However, there is the concern that the lifestyle of the living alone, and that they can promote the construction companies tendency, large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its "Schuhschachteln" much faster than larger units sell.
They are so popular, and the units are for days or even weeks faster than the larger units sold out.
This means that it is for our cash flow are much better.
He, however, is that the new standards the developers clearer guidelines, which previously put obstacles when they were too many small units within a project to build.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules of the road to a rise in national birthrate might cause, is in talks with the Singapurern who work in the financial district, that they will not have a major impact.
"The people are highly stressed, the apartments and the education are expensive, so it takes to say" by many a young managers.
The kids can others.
"For me, it is important for my own money and time to have another," says about twenty years old man.
Men and women of their career, the stress and the cost of the property and the education as the reasons that they have no children.
That is why the Singapurer have the last word when it comes to have children, as can the government still so much to do.

The offline Private offline is online privately
Privacy
According to the dictionary is the characteristic privately or "the area of private life, where you are entitled to protection against any kind of interference,".
What is privately for anyone under 16 years?
How will this definition to its everyday life and the social networks?
He understands the dangers to which he exposes the Internet situations, when he announced that he does not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years, often in the network.
In four of the cases linked it with the word "something very own" and "on a personal level on the password and user" if they apply it to the social networks.
"My deepest secrets in a post I would not provide" says the 10 years old Jorge in an attempt to the importance of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger to explain where he accounts for two years.
"These are very sensitive secrets, my mother must know it, but not the whole world," he acknowledged.
On FB I invite beautiful pictures or photos of games.
I think my time with friends.
"I would not a photo sharing, which is not of me, or from someone of the stupid," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong, obscene photographs of naked, of crimes, or insulting or violent comments to write.
Jorge assured, 35 friends to know that he and nine Folger in FB has in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
Including the mother, the password to one of the accounts.
Me, I reported on Twitter to express myself and interesting tweets to write.
"I do not know if someone, I invite you to only high," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can quickly with relatives in the distance, or with friends talk" is he.
He asked replies that he never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone empfähle a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year anniversary José is different.
The teenager, user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he gives to the people, not to know that he has added his friends list.
"It scares me, not because we have something in common, for example, music", he gives.
After the boy has given him no one hints or him after his address or phone number.
"They harassed me or if someone asks me, do I remove him from my account is simply," he said.
José got in contact with Ask, after he had read in Twitter a recommendation.
The boys are not unknown experience, which is now called Cyberbullying.
The friend of a friend was in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never know who it was," he assured.
According to José has not closed the account of the victim.
"He has only privately."
Then he explained a series of steps to create a user account sure to configure.
Unlike Jorge would this boy photos of friends upload in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do if he is unsympathetic to me or him one wants to dust.
"But I know that this Cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, says that the children and young people, must be understood that the purpose of the social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was conceived as a medium for the search for information; with the release of these pages, but the rules have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academics Marc Prensky, owner of a Master-title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "digital natives and Immigrants" these words of explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them that we still get themselves," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we demand that they have a defined criteria, distributed, published or can be said, and this in an age where the maturity of this is not enough."
"They should also be fussy when it is most important to them, to be liked, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert is the most effective way to teach the children and young people, which privacy is, to ask them questions that it.
"To tell you, they should do not, does not work", he says.
Porras then mentions a number of options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, if you like, if you published a photo of you, as you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the other about you?
Do you have the other people asked for permission before, if you have photos of celebrations labelled?
And one more question: What you need to know, do in any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet deals with respect, morality and other principles, and the same should apply for the social networks," he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational consultant, says that it is essential that the parents of the directives of the social networks carefully.
If they all sections understand they have solid foundations, with their children about the importance of Eröffnens one user on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you must share or publish" he explains.
According to Guardia, the children of the lesson "Thou shalt not speak with strangers."

"South America during the integration of the citizens have to learn," says Rafael Correa
The president, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a target, with "South America actually can learn something from Europe."
Correa, of the Sixth Summit of the President of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) attended nations, which took place in Lima, said the state television in Peru that Europeans "in the Second World War and in other clashes were killing" and "virtually a homeland today."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the Member States of the Unasur.
"Must be achieved the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as has been the case in the Andean Community; there are still, however, reactionary sectors that want a return to the past," he warned.
The president of Ecuador also advocated the redesign of the Organisation of American States (OEA) under the premise that the influence of the United States to reduce those states and to take into account that the agreement of San Jose on human rights.
Those who commit themselves to teach something never and, in return, we are signing the South Americans are everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the interamerikanische Commission for Human Rights, headquartered in Washington, and is funded by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum, the Ecuador, the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has conceded.
Correa said that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles, but his "deep democratic values and views on human rights has fulfilled".
He added that it had been "reasoned assumptions that Assange extradited to a third country and its procedure will not be observed."
He also criticised the Swedish justice, which required him to its territory, an interrogation because of alleged Sexualdelikts, while "to the Swedish case law that allowed through a video conferencing over the message of Ecuador in London would be executed."
Correa said that the danger that the health and the mental state of Assange would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I have not spoken to him, the ambassador has informed me that he is, however, a slight problem with the lungs, but no serious", said the head of state of Ecuador.
There was, however, a risk that he take physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and no physical exercises outdoors.
"This would adversely affect the health of all people," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum, the Assange for the month of June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, the granting of a Freibriefs, by which he was travelling in Ecuador, and that that is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities Europe 's. He emphasised that it had been with London talks to resolve the captive founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, this word in this case we are not, however, there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities in Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, a series of procedure leads to various European authorities," he said.
And "if Britain morning this licence is, however, in my opinion."
And if Sweden Mr Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or on Skype up and interrogated, as it allows the Swedish justice and in other cases, is the problem.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to portray himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said to confirm that what he does not tolerate, "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie that freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not the evil and perverse politician, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador is not more of such journalists "and not by the bankers or hegemonic and dominated spießbürgerlichen countries", and took away at a reelection that he "will deepen the revolution to lead the way in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision, the veto against Paraguay in the (at least until the next elections, arguing that the organism "remain firm and no opportunism and must not be allowed to grant a legal coup" because "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The president of Ecuador is also keeping the wishes of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, Nicaragua were highly irregular in the advantage they gave the seerechtlichen borders between the two countries to negotiate for "absolutely justified."
This judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a Southern and a Central American country.
Conflicts are unavoidable, but they are in pursuit of a common path.
They must be comprehensively, so that they can overcome and look to the future.
He is just as familiar to a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the Court of Justice and said that "it is Latin America is right to call for international bodies, both countries to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he is a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, for his third term in a row, he gave at the possibility that he "with a lot of optimism and, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he was losing the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Makes has never interested me personally, but under so unfair circumstances such as in Ecuador these socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by the political power.
"My political movement had the belief that I was, the probable victory guaranteed, I must therefore this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my final period as President, then I would prefer from public life.
This applies also, if we lose.
"This is definitely," he said.
Correa also took on the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just with the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he planned, for a routine treatment have travelled there, and that is that he would again after the election campaign could travel to Cuba.
"It means, in any case, a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez", he said.
The Ecuadorian leader took today in Lima on 6 Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), with the call to a higher regional integration was stopped by for a sustainable progress, equality and security.

Cause of death due to AIDS is now a late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the SRC: HIV-positive.
"It was as if a bombshell," he says, referring to the moment when he received the diagnosis, the doctor with no discernible success "tried to mitigate."
He hid it in front of his family.
He decided to just about his illness and started to take care of themselves; and to inform this with such commitment that he has just celebrated its 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV-unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several struggles in 1994.
Fabrizio-living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which for 22 years at the beginning of the 1990s, when it was hard to imagine many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, it avoided even the director a clinic of the IMSS, to adopt "because it led to a dead end."
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible that this syndrome also with quality of life to survive.
But there are still many people in the clinic, who know nothing of their illness and in which the virus damage has already exhausted and their immune system, and the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the release of AIDS in the world, that is, after the first reported cases, "means the great success today that the survival of a patient who in the treatment and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said the head of the HIV-unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, although he said that this information in April of this year, backed by a respected scientific publication.
The expert for infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that the scientists since the 2008 schlussfolgerten that AIDS is not a death sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life of the extent of the impairment of the immune system of the people at the start of treatment, and that those who had not greater opportunities that are dependent on drugs: Up to 30 years for a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years with one count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, mean that the above, who at the age of 25 years, the diagnosis of HIV-positive, in this sense, "can be easily 75 years old, as long as he is under control," said this expert.
This progress in order to be able to properly, I must point out that the life expectancy of Mexicans live, on average, 76 years.
Even if the mortality rate in recent years has significantly reduced (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS by 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of the yes)), it is nevertheless true that since the release of the AIDS 60 percent of the national database captured patients have died.
Alone in Jalisco died in 2011 255 people, and to the month of May this year are already 187 deaths; however, assured that it since 2005 universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- Why is still people die?
- In my opinion, the problem of access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years ago we had no supply problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people in an advanced state come, because they do not know their Infektionszustand, i.e. in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a percussive statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us, if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence global mortality earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all those people, where this is necessary, must be offered massive screening tests."
This proposal, the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (government committee to AIDS-prevention in Jalisco) and also the patient as Fabrizio, of its test carried out at a private laboratory, for the simple reason that it had made a friend of him, despite his young age already in the AIDS-phase, and even the Kaposi-Sarkom (a krebsartigen tumor), which was one of the usual complications.
Everything is different, if you know you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die, and would like to hear anything.
"If I have to die, then three times to burst", says one in my case.
The change was to out improvement, I ernähre me well, practise sport and take the drugs.
His parents now know only that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, as anyone else.
"I work, go a lot, have an active, but responsible Sexleben, I respect to my health and the other person," Fabrizio, the agreed to his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to share with his testimony, in order to encourage those who today as part of the global AIDS-day scared.
They should make the test if they are to be. The sooner they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if you already know the diagnosis, should they learn how to live like all the people responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programmes and the ordinary citizens are large holes, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which was the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
On the specific places ", the distribution of condoms were actually increased, and once made them individually, now they give us packages with a hundred piece, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
The risk persons for new infections include the young people.
"What you need the?" Is a widespread Spottfrage Orientierungspersonal by social workers, in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, the young people do not want to expose the correspondent.
He suggested that this inefficient distribution to move on; the condoms are not just behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of institutions, who often visited by young people.
It should not be promoted the promiscuity.
They shall not be paid for the beer and Motel, as the governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether condoms are distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not enough; the best way to use those who already have a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key properties of Jalisco
There are 13.435 accumulated cases (12.158 1.317 AIDS and HIV).
The state is seen 4th place nationally in new and any accumulated AIDS-cases and in 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of contagious takes place through sexual intercourse, 6% above the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, because it is for every registered case 4 or 5, there are people who do not know.

After the Court of Appeal judgment of the United States has confirmed that the restructuring of the liabilities of the group Vitro, which does not recognise a Handelskonkurs in Mexico has been achieved, will be a more sinister precedent for each national companies with branches in the neighbouring country, has created the billing.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the company, the Mexican laws allow, in the land of the Stars and Stripes contrary to international agreements have no validity.
In practice, on 15 June, recognition of the sentence handed down by the judges at the court in Bancarrotas Harlin Hale for the Northern District of Texas, the Mexican companies of the seizure of their property on the other side of the River Bravo helpless.
However, the decision opens the door to glass manufacturers in Mexico because of three inconsistencies in the Supreme Court of the United States.
While the judges of the thing points out that the creditors in the bankruptcy of the United States, says must be subject to the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, firstly, that the main processes in the treated Handelskonkurs in Mexico.
The first point would mean that the international cooperation in procedures in the event of the insolvency of companies which are of trans-national profile is not known.
Indeed, the Modellgesetz of the United Nations for the unification of the international commercial law, with the American Law Institute, was used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment that without the voices of the societies for recognition of liabilities in the liquidation of the branches of Vitro, with its parent company did not receive the required majority for the restructuring of the debt would have been achieved.
But this is the possibility of the Mexican laws.
Indeed, if not the first case in which this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group from the Instituto Federal de took Mercantiles (Federal Institute for Handelskonkurse) were confirmed.
It is true that after the votes of the creditors of Vitro subsidiaries, the creditors, which the courts in the United States against Vitro complained, i.e. the vulture-fund such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, no majority had achieved.
Would be 45 percent of the vote, against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, there are Vitro blame for its difficult situation from 2008 in the framework of the great economic crisis in the United States, which blows to the country.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotters, Héctor "the Hetin" Reyes, was the Korbsport for more than 60 years, and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a great intellectual collection of the history of each of the country as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was killed by a stroke in 2008 was confined to a wheelchair, was Rexes 6 years part of this sport, whether it be as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, agent and head in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of Basketballverbands.
"My life I have many hats in basketball, even more at the same time, President of the BSN, CEO and President of the Association of the national team in the 1990s was", remembered Reyes on a visit from Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he met Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years, lives.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes exaggerates with this statement is not.
The walls of his house, almost all with photos and memories of his long career decorated and they testify.
In the heart of Bayamón
The emotionalsten memories are those of his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 1950s as a player to 1982, where he remembered his 15-anniversary as fireworks Mitgeschäftsführer or managing director of the clubs.
"Those were my best years I have enjoyed most because I part of eight championships the Vaqueros since 1967 as Managing Director, whether it be Mitgeschäftsführer or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I passed with a championship in 1981, the year of the debuts of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was "a very good manager, says Reyes.
I remember that I am Gene Bartow, who worked as a trainer and at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very strong and 2 m wide players.
Do you want to him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico has ever had.
Recommended the Bartow Freiwurfspezialisten Raymond Gausse, and made one of our best shooter was.
I remember, as he said that if Mincy a championship for Bayamon, Gausse for another.
The championship with the Vaqueros Gausse grants, but he was from a distance, because he is already out in 1988 at the top of the Association.
At that time, he pulled his executions by Mincy and in the national team.
I remember when we vorolympischen tournament for the first time in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, in which we occupied the fourth place, bronze should have been, if not this Canadian judge would have been the last move us again, for the second time, said Reyes.
This group of the World Cup in 1990, was the best national team which thou hast ever seen?
It is one of the best, as well as those that during the Olympic Games in 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite, but the team of Free Games in 1991 in Cuba, where we gold and the team of the United States won a battle, as when they against us in the world championship bronze.
When the team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Don Quixote" Morales, the 1990 because of a knee injury not able to be present.
A team that perhaps in terms of personalities is not the best, but we won a gold medal and a great pleasure for us was that of the vorolympischen tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner to replace the suspended players because of the events in the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, against all forecast won the gold medal.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
This was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of the international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico, at this level, so how Piculín dominated.
And this, without his career in different leagues, where he has played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult issue.
We have had a number of good coach as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys I like the work of Leo Arill well.
What do you think is the best that you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of national team from 1988 to 1995, which the BSN at the beginning of the 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What can you do?
There are things that I have been introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
The guys in Ponce, for example, only in their territory and play only in the national breaks on crews from other corners of the island.
Today, the children of unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I can see the outcome of the compulsory education and courses for coaches and referees, table-officials.
I am proud of that.
What do you do today?
I listen to music, watch videos of music my time in YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time I go to a studios.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.

But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly loathsome J.R., Hagman became a superstar.
The dramatic series of television network CBS over the Ewing-clan and other figures in their surroundings, from April 1978 until May 1991.
The slogan "Who scored on J.R.?", the expectation for an episode of emotions, where the figure was almost killed by Hagmann, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars have been wagered in Wetthäusern.

The start of the course of the "end of the world" studied
Each week, the students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
Each semester, if the Religionsprofessor decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had about an irresistible hooks: The end of the lengthy "unlikely" of the Maya calendar-on 21 December, of which many people believed that the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what it in the following two months should expect: The devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some have described as a "Deudarmaggedon", as well as a growing conflict with the participation of Israel, the place from which the Christian theorists believe that the Apocalypse starts.
"I have not noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste semester ever Charmé this week," said the students at the University of Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
If someone, as happened in the world, as if we were thirty days from, it would be a really good period.
And he recalls that the bad good for those with apocalyptic mentality is.
And he is not the only professor who this semester, which is the last in history, courses on the "end of the world".
In Temple, the beisitzende Professor Barry Vacker the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Each week, the students apocalyptic themes such as the nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas spread, with time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered, which to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war may break out.
This month, analyzed the students movies with apocalyptic content and how they are compared to compare the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students as possible, probably, credible and is impossible," said Vacker.
On the third of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague, Amara beisitzende Solari, a professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team around a course with the simple title "The end of the world".
"We take in 2012, so that we do not always have the option to hold the course again, in the event that the world does not sink Restall," said.
Despite the "imminent doom" students must study projects and on statutory audits.
In Penn State will be the final examination carried out on the eve of the Apocalypse, which is why the students have no other options to continue working as a "until the night, where the world is coming to an end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no seats" said Restall about his course for students with a high average, which is filled with 35 students.
Respectively for weeks before we received e-mails from students who asked whether there were free.
For its part, the students say that of course is one of the most interesting.
"It is fascinating to see what people do to console themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year old student at Rutgers-Camden for religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic Sekten- or Religionsmentalität is actually only a matter of solace or its absence.
The 25-year old student Will Wekesa of Psychology and nursing explains all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard anything from a classroom, where it will be informed," he admitted.
I enjoy it.
But none of the surveyed students - and even less a professor, said that in the last date of December 21 to believe.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Maya, and in particular way discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never said ahead of the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he realizes that, in the western society an apocalyptic fear is that back several centuries, when the people to changes in their environment with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"Wherever the people do not think so," he says.
This is mainly in the English-speaking world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a Religionsprofessor the University of La Salle, which this year in the Philippines, responds quickly to the question of whether it is a course on the "end of the world know".
"The Philippines are not participating at the end of the world," he wrote as a hint on an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days of last dish, and said that if on December 21, nothing happens, "the people immediately think of a new date" or about philosophierten that the December 21, the start of a seven year period is that the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date.
Several said they have "to celebrate the end of the world" want to go.
"Maybe I call a few friends, so that we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year old student for communications.
