A republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against the election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers it as a myth, claiming that election fraud is most rare in the United States that the number of people killed by lightning.
Moreover, the lawyers republicans have been only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will influence negatively the level of participation.
In this sense, these measures will undermine part of the democratic system in the us.
Unlike Canada, the united States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of governments americans promulguèrent from 2009 new laws making it more difficult the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has grown after the elections in November 2010, which saw add 675 new representatives republicans in 26 States.
As a result, 180 projects of laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced during the year of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo identification card and proof of u.s. citizenship.
Moreover, these laws also reduce the periods of vote by anticipation, invalidate the right to register as a voter on polling day and retire to the citizens having a criminal record their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no State in the us is required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
Indiana was the first State to ask such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The republican authorities were quick to extend this practice to other States.
In the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 States to force the voters to submit an identity card with a photo.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, the american citizens do not have identity card universal as the map of the sickness insurance.
In fact, 11% of the american people, or 21 million people in age to vote, do not possess identity cards with photograph issued by a government agency in their State.
By the way, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a piece of identity.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the id card is required.
The new restrictions disproportionately affects young people, minorities, and persons with low income.
In fact, 25% of the African-American, 15% of people earning less than $ 35,000; 18% of the citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of the voters from 18 to 29 years old do not have the identity card required photo.
Much more.
The students, of the voters considered voting more for the democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photograph issued by their institution.
However, these same States allow the members of the clubs of fishing or hunting that vote more on the republican side to use it to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State requires proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
From 2011, a dozen States have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are u.s. citizens.
These measures are clearly intended to limit the hispanic vote.
However, it seems that two hispanic voters on three encourage the democratic party.
By the way, the republican legislators have sponsored by 2011 laws abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to enrol.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election, the country of registration of the voters have helped to save approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a fall of 17%, the rate of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the republican legislators have adopted laws in five other States aimed at reducing the period of advance polls.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who have voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter accounted for only 13% of the voters of the State.
It was the same with the Hispanic.
These accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of citizens who voted early.
In return, the white, which made up 76% of voters do not accounted for 46% of voters voting by anticipation.
Of course, lawmakers democrats and their supporters objected vigorously to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the governing democrats.
The attorney general of the United States intervened to suspend the laws of the most controversial.
They were able to limit some of the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 States have passed laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photo.
However, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critics democrats denounce the partisan laws that have been voted on, and they see it as an obvious objective of influencing the results in 2012 in the key States.
A report of the Brennan Center of 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of 270 votes in the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections of 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will influence negatively the level of participation.
In this sense, these measures will undermine part of the democratic system in the us.

Screening of prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the test of APS would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative or false positive, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to do to hesitate still more men are already reluctant to undergo screening tests.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have recommendations farms.
Another study, this one european, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who have had a screening and those who have not.
This study has also shown, with a follow-up after 12 years, that it was between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if it is not detected.
I therefore recommend that the test from 50 years, or 40 years old if it was a direct parent who has already had a cancer of the prostate.
The men of african-american are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once it has been detected cancer.
There are for aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
It really takes to make it clear to the patient, the degree of risk of cancer by offering him the possible options, by not addressing necessarily cancers of the prostate, which do not affect the long-term life, and opting rather, in these cases, for an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men at whom it detects a cancer will not be processed, because their cancer is not aggressive and are not a threat to their lives.
We will suggest them to make the active monitoring, and if the disease progresses, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly, it is determined with accuracy of criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
I recommend, therefore, when even pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine if you should move or not.
In collaboration with the international Society of urology, Movember has created a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevent the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of the research, the adoption of good habits of life, is the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that if all the world was eating well and was moving enough, we could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If no one smoked, this rate is expected to rise to at least 50%", stresses Andre Beaulieu, a spokesman for the canadian cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also totally unexplained.
For the canadian cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smoking rooms.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of cases of cancer of the lung.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This night much to the health of the people.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," the spokesman Andrew Beaulieu.
Given encouraging: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer fall by half.
The weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and cervix.
"The research shows that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against cancer of the colon", adds-on.
The power
The organization also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat.
Too much of it, she pushed the risk of colorectal cancer.
The meats too, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of the meat by smoking, drying or curing can lead to the formation of cancer-causing substances.
"These can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", explique-t-on.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, are not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
Then one of them found a reduced risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer is not clear, either.
By the way, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of speaking of her worries and family history with your doctor.
"Spend a screening test, it does not give the cancer."

The Higgs boson husked
The announcement of the discovery is probable that the Higgs boson has created quite a stir, last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson is participating in the mechanism responsible for the mass of any thing in the Universe, no less.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and the behavior of matter - but that has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is still not completely sure whether it is the property of the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a genuine new particle, and it looks a lot like the Higgs particle predicted by the standard Model.
In addition, new data to be unveiled this week at a large convention of physics, Kyoto, seem to confirm this, but there remains a lack of data to be perfectly certain.
Suppose all the same whether it is well Higgs, since the chances of getting it wrong seem thin, and see what it is.
There is, in this world, a law must inevitably wanting that two things cannot gather at the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're going to hurt you.
But even if the particle physics is a world that is strange, it turns out that she, too, is a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which states that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state", consisting of roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, the physicists classify the particles in two categories.
In one corner we found good citizens named fermions, who obey quietly in the Pauli principle.
And in the other agitated bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have respect for nothing, but in any case, not to this principle, which means that they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons, is divided into two groups, according to the website (absolutely extraordinary, for that matter) The Particle Adventure, Laboratories Berkeley: mesons, that we will not discuss here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would be in some way related.
These bosons, it must be stressed here, not all of the critters as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a ruling of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in effect, a particle with an electric charge is accelerating or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "inconvenience" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "bearers of force".
Field more stable
It's the same with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson appears.
Gold, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, a little bit as if it were a frozen pond which only a very large rock could rider the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator as one of the CERN's Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
This is because not all the particles, and all of the materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, the font, but other non - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep himself on a fridge.
And in the same way, these are not all of the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (like the photon, hey) do not.
Now, what is "can bring" all of this research, demand Ms. Plamondon?
For science, this is used to check the validity of the standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to discern any difference between the observations and predictions of MS.
They are, moreover, several hope that you find, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, does not offer any explanation for gravity (oops!) or the dark matter, which form approximately 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!).
But it has not found such differences at CERN up to now.
Impact
The implications of these research in the daily lives of mr. and mrs. Everything-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be one.
Stand: at the very beginning of the 60's, the pioneers of laser, in Bell Labs, not suspected of any revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw of scientific applications, but nothing of the rest.
In fact, we have already said, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who has worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and which itself has developed the world's first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962, at the start of the laser was rather seen as a "gadget lab".
Imagine...
And then, the applications can also be obtained from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor in 1969, in the course of his work in optics.
This sensor, although this was not its original intention, now serves to"look" at all the digital cameras of the world, and earned him the Nobel prize in physics 2009.
This does of course not to say that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know...

Palliative care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir
With his Commission to die in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end-of-life.
The debate should resume shortly so that a draft law is prepared.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
The Duty has tried to look at it more closely.
There are some weeks, Mr L. still lived alone in his apartment in the Monteregie region.
Prostate cancer that was eating him had left a respite of two years.
" They had given me five years to live, I've done seven years, " he says, mid-fig mid-grape, lying in his bed at home palliative care Victor-Gadbois, in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
" But it is always a shock, you can't be prepared for that, " he said.
The disease is at work: a huge weakness which makes going to the toilet by himself, and even eating alone.
While sitting in front of a mouth-watering breakfast, he agrees to let it help to eat, resigned.
Brave, it happens even to smile, talk to strangers who busied themselves around him, bring him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage of the death of the ordinary.
" My biggest wish is that I will heal diarrhea, it is humiliating",-he says.
A few hours later, the team has found a cure for this evil.
" In the course of our life, we learn that a man, it piss standing ", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the maison Victor-Gadbois.
Regress at the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the ability of the person " to accept the regression, he notes.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments unfold in the very heart of this regression.
The patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois all suffer from cancer.
They have a prognosis of life maximum of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around us, does not provide more care so-called " healing ".
For Ms. A., 89 years ago, the worst fear is to die " conscious and throttled ".
But the disease has made me discover my children.
" I have good children, " she adds.
" I no longer wish in life, " she said, before accepting that it poses a mask to help her breathe.
She waits all the same, in the next few days, a last visit to his son come from Italy.
Victor-Gadbois, it is a lavish, with a group of volunteers taking care of the body and helps it to the power supply.
These are the palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there are a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
It is very little when it is known that the end we all die one day.
Here, life goes on in the best conditions possible, " explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Regardless of the level of physical comfort, emotional or spiritual.
In dying, you will care of mouth brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetics will not be obliged to monitor their blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we have served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it was his son who will end the beer at the foot of the deceased.
" We help the loved ones as much as the patients, " says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
Home Victor-Gadbois, the days are the same.
On the side of an old man with a 93-year-old who enjoys his last meeting of the family in the yard, well propped up on his pillows while a toast in his honor, a young man of 36 years, died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
" For the past six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer under the age of 45 years ", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois come to their home, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is to say, treatments designed to soothe the pain when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Society of home-based palliative care in the Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in the health care quebecers who is afraid of several specialized doctors in palliative care, the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto, signed by the leading experts in palliative care, of which Dr Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, runs to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the quebec health care system is not performant enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before it agrees to perform euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient to spend 14 days in the emergency department, in great pain, and that they take all necessary steps to relieve it.
I am afraid that patients do not ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, many oncologists hell-bent on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
The hopes of survival of Helen Richard were already minimal when she dropped a grueling chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I stopped the treatment, she told me she was sorry that I had to stop beating me, she told.
Nevertheless, she had told me that I was finished !
't care all-powerful
Dr. Martel is believed that 90% of the patients who ask to die like to thank the caregiver does not have acceded to their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But it must be said that the palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care to the Company of home-based palliative care in the Greater Montreal, patients will be refractory to treatment against the pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, the doctors have so often resort to palliative sedation, who returns to fall asleep at the patient until the time of his death, or sporadically, or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the possibility to have this palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same phrase: " I want to die. "
But this does not necessarily mean " I want you to me euthanasiiez ", it means " I want to be relieved ".
The achievement of this report has been made possible thanks to a grant of journalism of the canadian Institutes of health research in Canada.

Scandals real large scale in Quebec
Officials of the road, contractors in the CONSTRUCTION industry, collectors of funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell day after day what they know of a great "system", combining building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and members.
The " industry " which has very costly to taxpayers quebec, especially in the years 1990 and 2000.
"It is curious how the system is crumbling since we took the great ways", quips Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and former police chief of Montreal.
It is by him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, by means of a background investigation on the corruption related to contracts for road works in Quebec, in which the liberal prime minister at the time, Jean Charest, had agreed that backwards.
The "report Duchesneau" was a direct link between industry, financing secret of political parties and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only department of transportation would have saved a billion dollars over the contracts," some that restrain their instincts to touch a share !
The Commission Charbonneau "has already dropped two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it gets to "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals."
A permanent unit, anti-corruption, created in 2011
The permanent Unit, anti-corruption, created in 2011, splint also with his army of auditors, investigators and analysts of the government.
More police officers of "the squad Hammer" which, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of the sewers" from Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swells of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted searches in series and made accusations of fraud and corruption against elected municipal officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a city suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has recently resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, the third largest town in Quebec.
It is believed to have pocketed of bribes to repeat in exchange for public contracts.
Are formally accused by the way of the engineers on the road to Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a sensation in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself has paid for years 3% of the value of contracts awarded to Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who paid them into the money to Union Montreal, the party of the mayor Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has sowed to the winds in the years 2000, giving more than 88 000 canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to the provincial party, especially to the liberals in power then.
He admitted also have organized a collection of illegal funds to the ex-vice-prime minister, liberal, Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts sewer which he inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working smoothly.
Gilles Surprising, ex-engineer of public works, was detailed to the commission: in ten years, it has received a construction business gifts, invitations, travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, ice hockey games and bribes totaling $ 736 000 dollars, in exchange for contracts sewer which he inflated costs.
Other officials of the road confessed to be done to grease the leg swelling of 30% to 40% of the bills by false extras.
Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closed the eyes on a budget parallel feeding its coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. jones has resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Roll was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm bell.
Mayor of the district of riviere-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, she rebels as soon as 2010 against the sale of land municipal bought $ 5 million and resold... 1.6 million developers in the real estate boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
The survey, which will eventually be put in place, she said that she "draws on a lan in order to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin wrongdoers".
The process, she said, is "painful but positive".
It is in the process of cleaning the wound but it should be an investigation unit own in Montreal and a day before, so as not to see the return questionable practices.
As it is the household.
It regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau note from his side that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but are concerned, above all, the role of the"elected representatives aware of the stratagem", when they do trempaient not in the scam !
Considering, 70% share of dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he quips: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of the reality."
The government of quebec offers a limit of $ 100 donations to political parties but this will not change the deal, according to him: "as long As we will not limit strictly the election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a comprehensive review of the system for the allocation of public contracts and the financing of political parties: "We can't go lower; go to the bottom of things, with courage, will to rebuild the house on a more solid footing, with more controls and laws."
If this story is tarnishing the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in their own backyard...

"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona !"
This season, you have taken on a new scale and with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress ?
It can be explained by a decision of individual conscience but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I rose to their side.
The technical staff, I was also brought much.
In daily life, these elements lead me to raise my level of play.
And, in the game, it is easier.
Everything goes very quickly in football.
But I do not inflame.
My debut in the centre of training of the INF Clairefontaine to my trip to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in stages.
You pull therefore benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruits of this summer are used to playing at the highest level.
They also know that each workout is crucial.
What makes a player like me want to face it and to provide the maximum.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my position.
It is supported by deputies as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the right man for the job ?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, it has no equal in Ligue 1 and is part of the best coaches in europe.
It was a great experience and has won a lot of titles with clubs upscale.
It has worked with great players.
I think he will win other securities in Paris.
In January, I had a discussion comforting with him.
I went out then a series of injuries.
The confidence that he grant me also explains my performance.
What's your opinion on the first part of the season of the PSG ?
In Ligue 1, Lyon we took the place of the leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our major objectives is the champions League: we have qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition ?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good european teams.
First we want to finish top of our group, in front of Porto, to be able to receive at the 8th final return.
The PSG can it become a big european club in the short term ?
He already has the budget...
To become a great european club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG has the means to make this happen.
In Ligue 1, will not win the title, like last season, would be a big failure ?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really at the heart of bagging the title of champion.
Last season, it is not passed away.
In may, there has been a disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We made a very big season.
It ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, one is supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved a season even more fantastic.
This year, I think that it is good.
Even if the big teams such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think that we have the weapons to win.
Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG ?
It is natural that we expect a lot of us in the light of what has been invested and the players that we have.
We fully accept.
After that, when you win 4-0 at home against Troyes and that there is still things to blame us, it is sure that it is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what the people expect more.
We will never be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
It is not the FC Barcelona!!!
We are trying to put in place a project of the game.
A team is built with time.
It has been proven in the champions League that we could meet present.
Look at Manchester City that does not happen, for the past two seasons, to qualify for the 8th finals, they have also made huge expenses !
In the light of the amounts invested, you imagined with a 15-point lead at the break !
It was neglect our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been "boosted" by the new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of may we be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
The PSG seems to be totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better than one might say that there is a "Defeat"addiction".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and it puts a lot of goals.
He came for that, and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
It has demonstrated wherever he went he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we have respect for the man and the player.
It also complies with the men he has around him.
What he has done is really exceptional.
This pushes the other to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How have you experienced the Euro 2012 with the team of France ?
As a disappointment.
I had the heart to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from scrounge game time.
I've seen things down there and I got out of it stronger.
Today, I can achieve good games selection.
This is what I was hoping for since my baptism with the Blue.
It has learned the lessons of what happened in Ukraine and we must now have an exemplary behavior.
What's your opinion on the first months of Didier Deschamps, head of the Blue ?
It has the results to him.
It is well-placed in the group qualifier for the World.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires wins.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to do the comparison.
White had reached its goal we qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil.
The good draw (1-1) ripped off, on 16 October, in Spain, is there a match founder ?
This game gave us confidence.
Each fought for all the world.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never lived match like it in my career.

With Bitcoin, pay and sell without the banks
Just the opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, transactions identified and cost of treatment between the stakeholders.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made of monopolies bank, led to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a protocol for secure exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from peer-to-peer.
About 200 000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15 000 computers on the network.
A small thousands of Web sites accept free as gifts or as a means of payment.
The course of the bitcoin, after having reached a peak of us $ 30 (23 euros) in June 2011, has fallen to 2 dollars, five months later, before coming back today around ten dollars (the courses are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to the global trade in real currency or financial products.
Nevertheless, the european central Bank (ECB) is interested in a report on the virtual currencies released in October.
It describes bitcoin as "virtual currency with the most success", "in a competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to coins conventional".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency as the "credits", used for progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, each time, a central authority control and the trafficking trade.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are both custodians of the book of accounts, the auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network ?
Each transaction between two users is in reality between two e-mail addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of encryption dual-key.
The network can as well verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the book of accounts public, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes by the resolution of a challenge mathematical launched to computers, and the winner, a kind of a central banker interim, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
It is a phase hash of the file, that is to say, a transformation of a large file into a digital footprint shorter and unique.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number in front of "chop" the whole.
The purpose being to find the number that gives an impression particular (lots of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes check easily that it is good.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of all other transactions; any amendment would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay two times with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible until the one hundred millionth, which leaves the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also found in each increase of the computing power.
The life of the network already has had ups and downs.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen.
"The flaw used does not relate to the protocol itself," said Peter Noizat, which has just launched Paymium, a company of payment in real currency using the network Bitcoin.
The ECB reports also possibilities for money laundering through this service anonymously.
But the cash is also the default.
Actors such as weight Wikipedia refuse the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the blogging platform WordPress, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir, and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the book of accounts and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "balances giants" have been launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged", is looking forward to Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins gold.
Pierre Noizat, also the author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (real money) or to a payment by mobile without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate the transaction, that come back and cheaper.
The carrier manages more of its identity and therefore can be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement at the traders, who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is sufficient for them to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," explains Pierre Noizat, which ensures have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of the calling into question of hierarchical systems for systems that are more horizontal.
"It will take time for Bitcoin is needed, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, is also planning to re-evaluate the risks various, today regarded as high, in case of success of this currency.

We left Afghanistan.
And after ?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Nato and the U.s. should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the afghan army to regain possession of their territory, and that the Afghan people to choose their future, without any wait to us.
This is especially the afghan farmers that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed and wounded, the maimed.
The taliban consist of foreign extremists, former heads refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse to accept the presence of foreign army, as of the time of the Soviet union.
They want to defend their traditions, the old and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, pakistanis, arabs, uzbeks, tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will be more when the west will be more discrete.
The departure of French troops from the base of Nijrab, that I have observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to credits French, is in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored personnel carriers have joined Kabul without being attacked, flown by helicopters.
There will be no flood of the taliban on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their advanced irresistible from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was so empty, the country in blood and fire the struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country had then been seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former mujahideen, the afghan government and the current taliban converge in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notable of the anti-soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have morphed into hucksters, grabbing of land-governmental sell land to the refugees from Iran and Pakistan, with"huge contracts americans outsourcing.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought themselves.
The people, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government which is not made up of thieves.
A lot of young people want to leave, as will those who were able to take advantage of the generosity in the us: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They had been associated with the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have enjoyed the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul account now 5 million people, one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full of girls like boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to those young people who will never want to go back to the dark ages of the old parties, nor the corruption of some of the leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; the tv, and its Turkish soap operas, which have a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
The authorities who will the order be considered as legitimate ?
The former commanders of the anti-soviet struggle is concerned already rebuild provincial militias, which would remain outside the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, to the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain degree of decentralization, in the image of the western nations, but the United States has opted to turn it into a centralized State, presidential power box, abolishing the post of Prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want to controls foreigners, and in particular on the occasion of the elections due in April 2014.
But his country is, since the 50s and even before, is dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has not been filed in the road, no dam is in the state, no system important irrigation is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, a governmental control over the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise has been rumored that the Afghanistan possessed vast mineral wealth.
This has only added to the sense that the Western n"were there to capture it.
Without energy to process the ore of iron or copper on site, nor means of transport for export through the mountains, there are no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of My Aynak, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the world Bank) and search the huge buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
One day we will also Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend largely on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The departure of the troops fighting the French was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of aid traditional: high school girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the areas of military, legal, medical, and agricultural support to the Delegation of archaeology.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win the hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of aligning aid and actions offensive, service d""actions in civil-military" of the ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, has conducted, and is lead by a small French NGO, many works of collective interest and the shares of agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of villages in the mountains.
These works, power-intensive-hand-d"labour in the local area, have been able to help to contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of arable land.
That will leave us as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending ?
A budget is much more modest contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of local, very hard in these valleys, often located at 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests of small achievements agricultural emanating from the local communities of the province of Kapisa.
For that they are freed from the insurgency conducted by foreign groups, and the farmers have told me wish, it would be necessary to maintain in their favour a small civilian aid, well controlled, and which affects them directly.

A Constitution in the forceps in Egypt
This is a new poker president Mohammed Govt.
While in Egypt remain more divided than ever around the statement in the constitution, which grants him provisionally full powers, he decided to play his will.
Taking all the world of tennis, it was announced on Wednesday, that the constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
There is just one week, the head of the State was granted an additional two months in this house to finish his work.
It is now nearly two years that Egypt is based on a draft text, several times amended, which weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal entanglements.
This new initiative has increased the divide in the country.
For its opponents, the President perseveres in its "delirium autocratic", continuing to "betray his word" and "trample the law".
On the side of his supporters, it ensures that it is a way to get it over with quickly with the crisis in institutional and policy, accelerating the process of transition.
A referendum should be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which requires the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, with the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular legitimacy and democratic so that the dispute has been raging in the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour, as he claimed in an interview to the american weekly Time.
As this appeal to a vote precipitated holds the ultimatum to the egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, I keep the full powers", and they must supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the constituent Assembly, the great majority islamist, have voted in favour of the text yesterday.
Most of the democrats were still missing.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, and considered not to have been able to put forward their views.
The representatives of the human rights of religious minorities and civil society, had done the same.
So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, alternate members, have been added hastily, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the muslim brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it is the most often unanimously that articles have been voted.
Commentators have also amused by the fact that one of the only differences of the day will be expressed around... the hour of prayer, some members of the committee, considering that the pendulum of the constituent assembly was set wrong.
The text, which was still in the process of"to be voted yesterday evening, has 234 air.
Objects of attention, article 2 finally remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of islamic law are the primary source of law."
The islamist parties, for which the"establishment of islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace the "principles" by "the rules", which would have allowed a stricter application.
For the islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a token of their good will and respect of the other components of the egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", meet the liberals, who do not see it as a stroke of communication.
Because according to them, the islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They aim, in particular, article 220, which confers to the university of Al-Azhar in an advisory role, in particular for what is to verify the compliance of the laws with the sharia.
According to the specialist of Egypt Sophie Apple tree, it is worrying because "the people called to pronounce are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are further fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no implication concrete religious.
With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of the civil State.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not of the ulama but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempering Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the constitutional transition egyptian.
But he acknowledges "that there may be an ambiguity around the article 220, because the terms used borrow in religious terms.
It refers to the "fiqh" [islamic jurisprudence, editor's note].
And the question may in the future arise as to the extent of the civil judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is very criticized because of the powers which it grants to the president of the Republic.
The muslim Brothers argue that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the old regime.
Another point at issue: the powers given to the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense Council.
Not more than not to be forbidden the trial of civilians in military courts, as called for by the associations for the defence of human rights.
These are also concerns about the text, which they consider to stop it.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained, and the insult is now prohibited, and this could have a serious impact on freedom of expression, of the press in particular.
In addition, there is no article does not echo to the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is that the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the egyptian president was speaking last night on tv, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of State will parade them on Saturday.

In Israel, holy places, the Centre of the world and a sea of brine are waiting for the Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of the biblical truths, modern comfort and a wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has selected five great reasons for you to visit Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Not to be missed: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever enters these "baptismal fonts" will be touched by the divine Grace.
As to the Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: " where the water was changed into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he nursed the storm or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is at this point that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is well to Jerusalem.
The believers is roam the Street of the Suffering or the way of the Cross (in latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the praetorium), where it is held on the lawsuit, then drove through the streets of the old town up to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, and then to one of the Stone of the Anointing, and laid in the tomb.
It is here that you will find the centre of the christian world, the symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where he grew the tree used to make the cross on which he was crucified Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wailing Wall, which is the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 bc. J-C.
According to the tradition, people of different faiths leave small words accompanied by prayers, which are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress of Masada, former refuge against the enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 bc. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain, at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes on this summit full of history.
To the North of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m above sea level, is located in the ski resort of Mount Hermont which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski runs are a total of 45 km long.
The old beliefs want to that of the pagan gods have lived once at the top of the mountain.
Visit of the unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Impossible to visit them all during one stay.
Here are the five most interesting of which are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It is home to the very ancient scrolls of Qumran, or the Dead sea scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological.
See also: the Museum of art in Tel-Aviv.
There are mainly sets the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths compounds of castings of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in israel, enter the unique Museum Ralli private, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
The entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the museum of the Holocaust, or Yad Vashem holocaust museum, located in Tel-Aviv, which is back on the pages of the most historic and dramatic history.
The most tragic is the memorial of the children, constructed in memory of the 1.5 million children were exterminated in the concentration camps and the gas chambers.
You enter it and enter it in total darkness.
Stars twinkle.
You hear then the names of jewish children and the names of the countries in which they are dead.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three larger resorts of Israel is located on the shores of the Mediterranean sea, the Red sea and the Dead sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red sea even in the winter, because the temperature of the water does not go down below 21 degrees while that of the air can reach 23 degrees.
The Dead sea is even more hot and you can swim all year round.
By the way, this is the sea of the most unique in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, that is, 417 m below sea level.
Water color'azur contains the brine and retains very easily bathers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The landscapes that surround it are a surreal beauty.
It has to perform a treatment to water-based salt, silt, mud and for the treatment of various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, but also to just relax.
Discover the secrets of the Ancient
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris, which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The town is mentioned in the legends Greek and egyptian Antiquity.
According to the legend, it was here that Noah built the ark and that Perseus has saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
The tourists are especially fond of walking in the narrow streets which are named after the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street next to "your" sign, the destiny will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can see a bride and groom come to photo sessions of all Israel, and even other countries.
In israel, the city of king Herod, you can stroll in the roman theater, "conquer " the crusader fortress.
Under the roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judaea, and the residence of the prosecutors romans, in particular of Pontius Pilate.
The theatre is a carefully restored used today for concerts, evening and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollar to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
For urban transport, mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only line of the subway of the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the parties to the high and low of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the jewish tradition wants to celebrate the sabbath on Saturday.
Friday evening at sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport stop their activity.
And the work week begins on the Sunday morning.

There are no stray dogs in the streets of israeli cities.
However, there is a lot of cats fed well walking around the haughty look.
We can see the night sleeping on the roofs of cars parked.
These cats love the scene passers-by and do not refuse that we enjoy.
Renting a car varies depending on mark of $ 37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) 188 $ (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $ 15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.

"That language has, in Moscow will": migrants are saving money to learn the language
While the deputies and human rights activists are arguing about what is going to give the law on the language test required, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint-Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families at home.
Since the 1st of December, a law came into force and stipulates that each migrant worker will have to pass an exam in Russian.
For the moment, this rule is only for those who have the intention of working in the services sector, housing, personal services and retail.
However, with time, promises the federal migration Service, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also the History of Russia and the bases of law.
It will be necessary to validate her language skills in Russian to obtain and to renew his work permit.
Are free only to the nationals of the countries where Russian has the status of official language.
The persons who have obtained certificates or diplomas of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not affected by this law.
Profit, negative attitude and protection of the rights
The network of exam centres will be under the aegis of the Institute of Russian language of Pushkin, the University of peoples ' friendship, Moscow State University, the State University of Saint-Petersburg and other higher education institutions of Russia.
The immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations has been supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the federal migration Service.
But, before the act enters into force, the defenders of human rights have already many times asked the question in the press: what is going to give?
What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for the Russians and the immigrants?
First of all, meet the representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering "slave labour".
Many speak in defence of the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the federal Service of the Russian migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of human rights must begin before their departure.
Only a system of organised selection will solve 90% of the problems of the foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language, and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross the dishonest people who, under the pretext of the help, it will provide a "trip" in a little house overcrowded where he and dozens of his fellow men will haunt for months without food and paper and must struggle between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints on the part of our migrants.
"Among them, they are promised a thing, and when they arrive, they're wrong, we take their passport, and they do not receive the salary expected", confirms the Head of the Directorate of migration services for the work of the migration service of Tajikistan Tolib Charipov.
Not me not quarrel, mr. policeman!
However, many nationals of the republics of Central Asia who wish to come to earn money in Russia confide that they do not know not only the language of the country where they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
This of course, is not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow, would this not be a primary education fair.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough food to feed their children, not to mention the dress properly and to equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It is difficult when one does not know the language, they trust.
"You feel decreased and reduced".
The defenders of Human Rights notice, however, an important aspect of the act relating to the language.
The exams will be intended only to migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or official work thereafter.
Nevertheless, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason for this? The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you may get a false registration quickly for only 1 500 rubles.
The police russians know that we have false documents, that we do not have registration, where the cases of extortion.
"They ask us, 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," he told reporters Oumed Khouchkadamov, citizen of Tajikistan.
" Hurry up, don't skimp and buy yourself a beautiful work of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it was discovered that the registration papers of the migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Many false certificates of language exams have already been confiscated by the employees of the federal migration service.
The papers forged out of a color printer ordinary.
Of course, their new owners do not have them for nothing: each migrant, who hoped thereby to facilitate the task of the examinations had to spend seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker to three thousand roubles.
The representatives of the power and the defenders of Human Rights, agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper".
The authorities can give to migrant workers who have not been able to validate the exam at the first shot the time to take a language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicate with the people.

The Interior Ministry is not in charge of the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to toughen the law against carrying weapons to civilians.
Such is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether it's the shots made at weddings or of the slaughter organized by the lawyer of moscow Dmitry Vinogradov, which killed seven people.
The police wants to prohibit the carrying of weapons rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun permit from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma in the near future.
All the world is not satisfied to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centers of fire, require them to give up "this hardening insane."
The percentage of crimes committed with a weapon saved is minimal, said the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and specialist in crime for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, on a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes have been committed with a firearm registered in the police service while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are certain that the strengthening of the laws concerning the weapons for civil will not prevent criminals from obtaining supplies on the black market .
According to them, we can find today in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior stated that it control the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: the plant officer
The black market in weapons supplies via several channels.
The main channels are at number five, says Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking orders weapons
The first is "the trace of the military", that is to say the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons have been stolen by the Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians", explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the forces of order.
Baranets explains that it is also well weapons stolen in the stocks of the police than those borne directly to the representatives of the forces of law and order.
The guns illegal go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often suffered from the explosions.
"Versions attested to indicate that some of the fires have been triggered on purpose to cover the deficit," says the former military.
For Baranets, arms manufacturers are for something.
"We see weapons factories private that do not compete with the competition on the international market and sell the weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," says an expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is smuggling.
An important part of pistols and submachine guns from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes craft, a mafia formed, and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where are the weapons?
The experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was set up in 2011 by the Center for problem analysis and study for the public administration.
Specialists have analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and of Rosstat, criminal records and public information portals related to weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, just the army and security forces.
Half of these weapons on the black market has recovered " by fault of the employees whose work is related to arms", explique-t-on in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons originate from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are derived from the "clandestine excavations".
A salesman and consultant armoury who requested anonymity provides that for a long time no one buys the weapons found by the specialists of the excavation illegal; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will look for the new goods in the military warehouses.
The person buys through a taught a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
It delivers passing the goods through a fence.
" He carries in town, and sold it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers ", raconte-t-il.
"It is true that the police are aware of all of the business, as well, when crimes are on the point to be understood, it makes a purchase of control from the merchants of illegal weapons," adds the seller.
" As in a luxury boutique "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I have been to sites, blogs, until a type manifests itself and offers me to come to the station Begovaya where someone was to take me in a "corner" to haggle.
The price of the gun, we gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, it is necessary that I know of someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust her.
There are sellers in the markets, but there must also come by saying, for example "on the part Of such a person, who has asked me to convey his daughter has lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of fists americans to help a person to whom I trust.
I the book to me only because he knows that I don't give.
The small new look of the weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets was tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when it was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "anything you want".
"I thought I was in a luxury boutique", remembers the military.
There is no secret to the buyer, explains Baranets, we can all try it.
As a potential client, I don't just buy it, it goes with the seller in the forest and we install a target.
"They let me shoot and when I am convinced that the weapon works well, we start to negotiate, " describes the expert.
A shop from the sofa
The search engines display the sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons, "for different uses".
For this, we don't need no paper and no one to meet.
" It is enough to have a sum certain in money", wrote in advertising on the site "Buy a gun or a machine gun fight".
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to minors?
"Without a license, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buys TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in its application very direct.
The federal security Service has released a huge network of fake sites and pick up the shovel and the people who wish to buy weapons to fight.
People are flocking on the food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military
I have heard of this type of diagrams: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of application of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer shall make the payment on the machines.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where it is hidden weapon," says the secretary of the association " Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, we may end up without a weapon, and behind bars.
The federal security Service has released a huge network of fake sites and pick up the shovel and the people who wish to buy weapons to fight.
"People are flocking on the food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves to exploit coal in Siberia", - he says.
A Makarov for $ 100
The purchase of a firearm illegal, say experts, can cost between 100 and $ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", one can buy a gun Makarov for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It is out of the warehouses long-term by the management of these warehouses of average size.
According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes has decreased in Russia of 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles while confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and of bombs dropped by 7.8%.

United states: the employees of fast-food outlets and supermarkets are in strike
Nearly a quarter of american teenagers go through a job of a cashier at Mcdonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests is mounted against the low wages offered by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast-food chains such as Mcdonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will expand or decrease rapidly.
These actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of associations of the left.
Parallel to the increase of the modest salaries earned by the employees base at Walmart and in the fast-food chains, the organisers of the demonstrations want to get to the creation of trade unions.
This area is for the moment not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the "black Friday"at a time when a rain flood of balances earning million inhabitants has befallen America and triggering sometimes esclandres.
On this day, certain employees of the company Walmart, which employs the world's 2.2 million people, have left their positions to hold pickets with the trade unions and activists of the left in the shops of the company whose products are intended for consumers of the lower classes and medium-sized.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns, passing by the car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are, on average, 8% to 27% less expensive than in the large supermarkets.
This is why a lot of employees are poorly paid at Walmart do their shopping only at their place of work.
The price and the choice of products made of Walmart, one of the groups most powerful in the United States.
According to the critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap in particular because of the low wages of its employees.
These also complain of difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or scanners-handheld.
The participants of the manifestations of the "black Friday" were asking for a salary increase, they complained of the fact that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company was increased from 30 to $ 100 per month.
For the employee base at Walmart that affects a 9.5 per hour, it is a sum that he can not afford.
Scientists from the university of california Berkley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $ 12 an hour, it would cost the group $ 3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more than what it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all of the increase of wages on the shoulders of consumers, each running in the shop would 46 cents more.
They will spend in a year only 12,39 dollars more than it is now.
The supporters of Walmart notice with satisfaction that the protests have taken place in only nine States and carried no prejudice to the group.
The "black Friday" has continued in the shops from 8 in the evening at midnight the following day, and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 items in the second.
Its unions have carried out a total of 100 million transactions for the "black Friday".
The spokesman of the company Dan Fogleman assured in an interview to the site of the left Huffington Post that in any "less than five employees of a wal-mart had left their posts and that the protest was a "com operation' among others" on the part of the trade union organizer.
"Next customer!"
The protests are continuing this week in New York, and were not the most Walmart stores (in this town progressive, they are not very much appreciated, this is why they are not yet established) but the Mcdonald's and other inexpensive restaurants.
Mcdonald's announcement to sell billions of portions and after they even give you no sick leave and don't pay you for the work you have done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the city Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage set by the federal legislation and that of New York is $ 7.25 an hour.
The fast-food increases with time, but low, on average, its employees basic affecting New York $ 8.90 per hour of the time.
Nobody touches less than them in this city.
For me it is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of american teenagers working at Mcdonald's after the high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing employees of Mcdonald's who complain of having to live with this salary, and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal, we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you don't know what you're going to feed them.
The demonstrators, who have launched the movement Thursday at 6 : 30 a.m. near the Mcdonald's 40th street and Madison Avenue required that the cashiers and the cooks of the fast-food are paid a minimum of 15 $ per hour, a multiplication of more than two times the current minimum salary.
They also requested to be established, with the trade unions in the sector of fast food.
U.s. law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish the protesters of a trade union by bullying or layoffs.
The authority, however, their simplifies rarely life.
For a trade union, to take possession of the fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They do not agree
Other events tumultuous stood near several other fast-food chains.
The key moment of the protest was the rally in the middle of the day near the Mcdonald's Times Square with the involvement of a number of policies local democrats, including that of Jumaane Williams, a member of the municipal Council, which said: "Mcdonald's announcement to sell billions of portions and after they even give you no sick leave and don't pay you for the work you have done honestly!".
The protesters have been supported by other democrats of new york in a view, in particular by the candidate to the post of mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "all of us must support the employees of the fast food that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that deserves every New Yorkers.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the most important to have occurred in the sector of fast food in all its history.
But only a few hundreds of people were involved, not to mention that not all were employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to say if this will spark mass movement will be small.

"For the time being, we can only moderately to fool the brain"
Lately, the fans of new technologies are used to perceive the augmented reality through special glasses.
At the outset, it is Google that has unveiled this summer its current model at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it is apparent from the interview with the director of the group of technologies of 3D interactive laboratory Microsoft Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, by creating virtual spaces open.
- Could you tell us in a few words what is your research group?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and we are trying at the same time to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the time being to the pixels on screen and sometimes to the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years in front of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console, and the sensors Kinect constitute a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in the order by the gesture.
- We also reserve the future?
- Although the Kinect has been made in the physical interaction, a lot of things are happening on screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, not really.
We are trying to change that and we are working on imaging systems truly 3D running on different technologies, including the technologies of projection.
It is necessary to make out the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more touch.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a form more convenient.
And to begin with, let us get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of the voice command ?
It is appreciated, but is not overstated?
We can not say that it is a panacea: the issue of confidentiality arises because we don't always want to inform others of his actions or of its intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought to gestures, not gestures wide, but rather to gestures discrete, limited.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn on the hand, which recorded the movements of the muscles and bones.
Currently, he is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the joint command, for example: a gesture + voice.
- That is to say?
- For example, how I would ask you to pass this can?
You would with the word and with gestures.
- Usually, I only speak.
- Oh, it's going to be difficult to recognize.
- So, you want to force the users to adapt it according to what the machine may or may not do at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is of mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify the reactions of the man.
This may include, for example, laser sensors, they produce a good enough resolution in depth and it is very important.
- If one is interested in your work on sensors Xbox Kinect, what is it that you do not like in the modern cameras ?
They lack the resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on the recognition 3D.
Obviously it would be good to get about 8 megapixel camera with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixel themselves, but the quality of the matrix, and the depth.
In relation to this last point, all current technologies are good enough, this adds work to the designers of algorithms.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
The speed is also important to many, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s not enough really not, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory Redmond has given to the touch sensors delay regular treatment between 1 and 100 us, the sensors, the current being closer to the second value (60-100).
The whole world does not understand to what extent it will influence the interaction of man and of the machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but do not require to touch, to have more frames per second.
- But don't we have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of reflected signal.
And the third camera is in fact a sensor usual visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or worsen, increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how this could help to define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not submitted his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that a point of view of the daily use of the technology of augmented reality, the glasses are one of the platforms with the more prospects ?
- Of course, to walk around all the time with a smartphone with uplifted hands is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transitional" that you would from a cloud platform to spend glasses to the smartphone.
The glasses are a device very personal and that is what makes their strength (personal items are the ones that you are the only one to see) and in the same time their weakness: the augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of objects holographic virtual in the air is no longer accessible Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is an issue on which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What are the answers to your group prepares there compared to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of second-hand to serve as a support in the image.
It saves perfectly pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to assign the palpabilité to these "pictures in the air" : for example, the interference of several rays, ultrasound directed to a specific point where the finger and which gives you the feeling, for the time being still low, a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There is also the bracelets worn on the wrists, which affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a line of work with prospects.
- And you tried to trick the brain?
Make him believe that he feels that he should normally feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not yet tried.
There is still a task under there, on which it will still take a long time to give of evil: how to believe in someone who is physically located in a very small space that he is walking in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of the treadmill (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also of the balls giant.
For the time being, we can only moderately to fool the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.

The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The avant-garde pétersbourgeoise" dedicated to the city-dwellers who are in advance, to the avant-garde of culture and art.
This list ultra-selective has already hosted prominent actors of the artistic stage of Saint-Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and that has found recognition in Europe, having been known in Russia as a whole.
The new hero of the "Rosbalt" is the painter outgoing Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this man, rather, bearded man, dressed all in red that we can cross near the Russian Museum, the summer Garden or in the holidays and openings connected.
The tables Kirill Miller together always a crowd, regardless of their place of exposure.
It is one of the storytellers pétersbourgeois inherently social, and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of avant-garde pétersbourgeoise of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance is smiling at the people and puts them in a good mood.
Recently, he has taken in his hands a barrel organ, and it became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg since he had matured enough for this role it difficult to by its existence, its philosophy, and its image as a gypsy.
- Kirill, why is it that you route the city, all in red and not yellow or blue turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red one as a fashion designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, the red is a compromise between the artist, the creator of the image and the society.
Even if in the company, everything that is not gray raises the aggression and agitation, in the negative.
But my provocations are intended to initiate the discussion.
The whole story of my actions challenging is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you understand that you had to be a painter?
- The exhibition at the Palace of culture Nevskiy where were my works.
I understood that this was my path.
Then, the wave of the old painters non-official was passed and the new, free, like me, were misunderstood.
I started to make friends with the artists of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there is no more vague.
I am interested in theatre, the fashion, the music, all genres except for the words.
- And all that is found in your Clinic artistic... - It was important for me to find myself in the culture centre of Saint-Petersburg where must bring together the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which was before the work is a musical club and artistic, bohemian club, the home of the bohemian pétersbourgeoise.
Many are born: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour happen with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang songs, easy play-back in tight-fitting suits, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer fashionable today.
When the band started to perform live, he has become the "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg hosted a lot of emissions before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg, and it is then that its great career began, but her training and basic education, it is in us that he received.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboedov": what are the implications of the Clinic artistic.
Our employees are left as they used to.
I am a hero of the past century, the time when the culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "people of our city".
I was named "artist of the year", and it was then that my reign came to an end.
This is not convenient to work in a new era, with the old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty, and the culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- A lot of my paintings are hits, they have a story and a sharpness very strong.
I'm going to have an exhibition scheduled "The Russian museum through the clowns".
The clowns belong to a category that is timeless.
Before I was someone of social, today it hurts and it's scary to be so.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I love the grotesque, I have ideas grotesque.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the disguise total and compulsory.
Today, it is the habit that matter, we are interested in the mechanism outside, but not inside of the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but it is rather to spit in the face.
And the lie will be erased by the disguise.
- Recently we have seen in the role of the organ grinder. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who else but me can play it.
- But it may be that the commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the art of trade must be careful, delicate, sweet.
The disintegration of the culture is in the process of happening.
Before, people were shared in herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the simpleton another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, it is necessary to think that you're going to please.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But many thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- These are people we have thrown who come to see, it is the sexual side, and social works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will be coming, 10 miles will not come, and in the end it is less of management, money, everything dies.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to cheat, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I painted the tables as a collector has hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that are usually those that are painted in end-of-life.
Today, we often confuse the ideas.
It is said: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
The consumer has no culture, it has nothing to do.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused to accept the money just for the painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, that is what is missing in Saint-Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of the culture.
But not everyone can work in the culture.
Under the reign of good czars, it was not like that, the tsars were not well understood by the culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are now good consultants.
We have people here in Saint-Petersburg who might be experts, but they are excluded, because it is necessary to experts, the most high, which will evaluate correctly these experts and their fraieront a way.
Currently, it is the "reign of taste", which blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, that is what it is Saint-Petersburg ?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there are in Moscow much more culture, there is a ground for that.
And on our stones, art of struggling to push.
We need a cultural ground, and we have more writers than readers, and that is bad.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people who are going to see exhibitions, concerts.
For us, this layer is very thin.
We need to make the art in fashion as it was the case at the beginning of the last century.

To give birth in the space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid murderer.
Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings on board set out in search of a spare planet.
In order to save humanity, a big question arises: how to keep our species in weightlessness, or on a spare planet ?
I believe that there is not much choice.
There are in fact two real planets that we can conquer, this would be only by assumption.
" It is of Venus and Mars ", believes Vladimir Muted, a researcher from the astronomical Institute of the State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on March the conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500 .
No one can live only at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We started to take an interest in questions of reproduction in space, focusing on the flora.
There is still a half-century, we have performed experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas are grown on orbit does differing in any way varieties earth.
Then, we put on orbit insects, small flies, fruit flies breeding.
In 1979, quail eggs have been sent into space to see how is developing an embryo in weightlessness.
One gets the output of a chick is quite normal.
It is then that the problems begin.
" The problem is related to the fact that the chick needs to find a support, it must get on its feet and start moving, " explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of problems of medico-biological characteristics of the Russian Academy of sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
In finding no support, day-old chicks is waved disorderly manner.
And at the end of 10 hours, the new-born saw their instincts fully atrophy.
The chicks did not react neither the light nor sound.
Unfortunately, they would die just at the end of four days.
" We have écarquillé the eyes two times, and then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there, " says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experience with the chicks in the space.
The last "ark miniature" organic with animals has been sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite " Bion " there will be that of the species of the same sex.
There has been an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses in the space.
In principle, there was nothing found nothing supernatural.
" It was still biosatellites and then it is only experience. It is necessary to carry out this kind of research, " remarked Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the rats space have given birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it is still not managing to make reproductions directly into space.
This is not a trivial matter.
Losing their usual environment, the animals are no longer able to carry out their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, man is able, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he is able to create an emotional background suitable.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But the women are in the area for the past 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the female body is what humanity's most precious possession.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could not say if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she would have been able to give birth to a child after the flight.
" Nobody answered this question, " says Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retired from the area of rocket and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice on orbit and have even worked in the mid-extra-vehicular activity, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, very little of cosmonauts, who have nothing had and who give birth to offspring in full health after long flights.
" And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during the flights in orbit ", concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Polyakov.
Yet, humanity must seek new solutions in the biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Laboratory of hydrology of the Centre of preparation of cosmonauts: mandatory step in the preparation for the flight.
Here, in the neutral buoyancy, the cosmonauts train for extravehicular activities.
The water mimics the conditions of weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable, however, a foreign setting, for infants, it is their true element.
The little men amphibious seem to confirm this: life on the Earth comes from the ocean.
To the extent that the baby is changing about 9 months in the lymph fluid from his mother's womb, it is easier to get used then to the water.
In principle it is logical, because since its birth to her first bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
" This is very little to forget, " says the instructor of swimming for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if the child who has been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs of gravity, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, atrophy very quickly, the ability to thrust the baby is lost.
Okay, ignore it by relying on the simulators of childbirth.
Of course, we can prepare a birthing in a special room, the woman will bring it out.
" And then?" asks Valeriy Polyakov, inviting them to reflect on this complex issue.
From another side, the child also needs an artificial gravitation.
If he does not feel the earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can't dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for the trainings.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
" And this experience that we might consider in this case imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a child with a disability, completely inept ", provides for the Director of the committee for bioethics of the Institute of problems of medico-biological characteristics of the Russian Academy of sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of the children in the area is still something of a theory.
However, with time this will become a reality, when the Earth will be in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.

The head of the SAI (supreme audit Institution (public finance) said: " the control of pseudo-self-employment (in Czech " system Švarc ") failed because of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and legislation of quality, but it is lagging behind for its application.
This is what was said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the supreme audit Institution of public finances in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, this is what is lacking in us, " said Kala in his commentary of the current situation.
A control conducted jointly by inspectors czechs and germans also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the " system Švarc " by Petr Nečas.
Mr prime minister has recently said that the ODS was not going to annoy the entrepreneurs with controls; so is this allowed or prohibited ?
" The law must be applied in a way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent him from acting in an authority responsible going to inspect to require compliance with the law", notes Kala.
At the meeting of the control commission of the Chamber of deputies, you mentioned a project of Czech-German within the framework of which have been compared laws in the area of public procurement of these two countries.
What was it a question specifically ?
It is a parallel control, which we launched it and that was about two years old.
In simple terms, the eu legislation provides for how to manage the procurement and of the national laws in particular, as well as a practice in itself make him more.
We have gathered all of this, and although the procedure is not completed yet, very interesting differences we have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "the most severe and of better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice, as such, is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not enough to develop continuously rules are more detailed but that it is necessary to devote to the implementation even of the right.
What this project can it help you in concrete terms, and that does it for you ?
A common control of this type should just contribute to this that we stop we strive to specify the laws, to decline and improve the thresholds, if this does not make a really positive.
The principle of good management means to get the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude all enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the thresholds of the markets, we will not necessarily this goal.
It could be that this system is at such a point overwhelmed by paperwork, that those who seek loopholes will find many more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation in practice of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the system control in Germany ?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a mode of organization different ?
For institutions, similarly to the ISC, works out there in the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a council made up a little differently, but these two institutions carry out basically in a similar manner .
The skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance, however, in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, it has, therefore, also of current accounts of this type at the level of individual States.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds with us to the resources of the State.
Public funds are managed in us by the regions and the municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the current accounts of the federal states.
In regard to the national legislation, it is more simple than ours ?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, nevertheless, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but we certainly can't say that it has to do better in all areas.
This may be due to the fact that they have the best inspectors ?
No, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison.
However, it is also necessary to say that this country is that we consider a model is also facing a series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage to cooperate with our institution, non ?
In regard to the national legislation, that has meant to you, as an institution, the amendment of the act on public procurement, its effects are-they already feel ?
This amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet had any impact on our operations of control.
As we controls a posteriori, it is necessary to count with a certain delay.
Our comments relate only, for the moment, the process of preparation of the future checks - we have launched a new instrument of the "detection of the risk of poor management," with which we sifted through nearly 14 000 public procurement - there these changes will of course feel it, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures, and so on.
Is that so, do you consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration ?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the service provider (for example, the regional council, in the case of the regional operational programmes) compelled the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of the budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way ?
No, not that way, I think.
The system should exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not to punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
A system like this will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it ?
Let's look at where we are not going to.
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS was not going to annoy the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called system Švarc - what does this mean ?
The system Švarc is it prohibited or allowed ?
The law must be applied in a way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent him from acting in an authority responsible going to inspect and to require compliance with the law.
He can declare: " We will change the law and allow ", but he can tell that we are going to act as if nothing had happened.
The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on the formalities to be accomplished and what, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and it is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.

The snow stopped in the region and it remains in the plains that a thin layer of snow.
The ridges of the ore Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered about 30 centimeters of snow.
It is apparent from the data of the regional service maintenance of the roads that because of the fog, visibility was in places guests.
The fast track R6 and national roads of the region are now available without difficulties.
The vigilance remains, however, to put, for example, on some of the bridges which the coating can be frozen and slippery.
All the roads and paths of third category, including the mountain routes are also available.
It's still on some of their sections of the remains of ice and through places packed with traffic.
Especially in areas located at altitude, the drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Kralove
The road and motorway Directorate reports on its Web site that some roads Bohemian are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers, crammed with traffic can find on the roads in the mountainous areas and are situated in altitude.
The services of maintenance of the roads are warning drivers against the risk of formation of ice in the areas of the region of Pardubice located in altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Usti nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoke Mýto, and this, mainly on the roads and third category.
The roads I/43 and I/34 in the area of Svitavy have been chemically treated.
The snow is mostly located in the Giant Mountains (her giant) and the Mountains of the Eagle (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed down by the traffic is present on the roads in areas located at altitude.
In Bohemia, the time is now dry, the more often disengaged, with potential cloudy.
It will blow a wind and low temperatures will oscillate usually between -3 degrees and + 1 degrees C.
Pilsen region
The roads of the Pilsen region are now available, although in some places, it is necessary to exercise vigilance and to adapt his conduct to the weather conditions.
It's freezing this morning, the temperatures range between -3 degrees and -9 degrees C.
After the last snowfall and cooling that followed, some channels of communication can be in places frosts.

Šimon Ornest said: " In concert, we want to collect the positive energy. "
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month this should be the end of the world ?
This is only one of these alarming news, the kind of traps into which we fall in love.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh instead, and it is said that we are the only group able to collect the rest of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you go up in December a unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you describe in more detail what the project to our readers ?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years already.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced to the December 21, at 11 a.m. 10 in the morning.
The day before, on December 20, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the moment when will the end of the Mayan calendar on the island of Kiribati, which is located in the pacific ocean, on a timezone in advance of 12 hours compared to us.
Who had this idea ?
In the beginning I think it was my idea, then we have all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to set, with the public, think about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying online www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group the Tap Tap with other interpreters has also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, which is entitled " End of the world cancelled " (in Czech " Konec světa zrušeno ").
It is already very popular on YouTube, the hear-t-on also during these charity concerts ?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we are successful and that the end of the world has no place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The hymns will join also at a given time within the framework of a live broadcast, quite unique, Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X y also sings...
How are you coming to cooperate with them ?
We collaborate with other personalities of show-biz Czech, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charity events...
We strive to make them participate intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation, and that it amuses them.
How will the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world ?
To equip the training centre Studeo, which is accessible for disabled guests and we are working on the realization in the framework of the institute Jedlička, with the association Tap, and this for the last six years.
Teachers regularly with students of the institute Jedličkův and their offer activities that interest them and entertain them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to of course, we try to help them in this way.
In the framework of the completion of the construction of the institute Jedlička, we will transfer this project in a new separate building.
Several music groups and performers will perform on stage during each of these concerts ?
According to what criteria, have you chosen ?
We have tried to develop a program that caters to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will rise on the scene Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Georg Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Get ready also to other " mega-events " of this kind in the future ?
In may, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague spring; there, too, we will surely a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played, for example, in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours ?
This is not so terrible as it looks at first.
We have five members in the electric wheelchair of which the machinery must travel in the cargo hold, naturally we trimbalons also a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
Up to now, everything is more or less always well spent, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they gave me a surprised more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we bumped recently, everything went without problems.
Thanks for your travel abroad, you can compare what these countries differ for access facilities for disabled guests, attitude of the public opinion towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences up to now ?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where the whole works better, than at us, we have been witnesses in Moscow that is not all is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very accessible to persons with disabilities; there, it is not yet very common that a person moves only in electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider it as an evidence to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to attract attention to the problems of people with disabilities is currently being created.
What do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries ?
There are a lot of things for which we are still late...
It is important to mention that the improvements and enhancements still depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with a severe disability move only in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
This is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities to participate actively in the social life and on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the contrary, to the cutting edge of progress !
The respect of the public and the access facilities are one thing, but the situation really starts to change when we have among us sportsmen, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers famous.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The group the Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years back, what is it that you pushed in 1998 to create this group ?
I started to work as an educator at the institute Jedlička, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And as I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, a saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music business.
And then, with time, as said by our moderator Láďa Angelovič, it was a little lost control of the situation (laughter).
The success happened that in the course of these years, if I'm not mistaken ?
It is true, the fact of creating links with famous singers and work actively to the promotion of the group helped us.
We have understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to grants from the european Union, we can, in addition, allow us to have teachers of quality, facilities, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap ?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
Show business is full of things that were to copy from each other.
In some way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Rare are the original projects, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But the pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned of all, that we need to take pity on them.
These are people who can live a life full and flourish, provided you have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, this is not only a step forward for themselves but for society as a whole.
Is that your success is not also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are qualified by many people ?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and require a certain discipline.
But I think it is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize that they must come to rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieve goals.
The group the Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998 ?
A single, Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, the people come and go, we can do nothing.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
It will be the case on the eve of the day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the arena Incheba, to Brno to Fléda and Ostrava in the Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
In the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected through relay audiovisual when will be sung together the song of the group the Tap Tap " End of the world cancelled ".
The aim of the concert is to collect financial means (to the tune of 25 million CZK) to equip the training centre multifunctional Studeo, which is located in Prague in the institute Jedlička.
The price of a ticket to the concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years, the presale of tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.

Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the european space Agency, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member State of the former eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on November 12, 2008).
Poland had begun a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and over the years that have followed has participated in a number of projects of the agency.
The route from Poland to the space has, however, began much earlier.
Already before the second world war, Polish enthusiasts working on space flights; they do not meet always understanding.
I would like to mention for example the conference of A. Šternfeld of the astronomical observatory of Warsaw, December 6, 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from the work of avant-garde entitled " Introduction to astronautics ".
The developments of the young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only the doctor Jan Gadomski turned his attention to his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch for his book " Introduction to astronautics ".
Said dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) subsequently became a great propagator of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of astronautics world-renowned, its contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the far side of the Moon.
As early as 1925 was built in Poland a rail car, designed to be equipped with a rocket engine.
You don't know, unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project.
It is not clear whether the rocket had to be used to propel or slow down the rail car.
The only known information on this rail car, are those of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to devote himself to the rockets.
The research was carried out by the institute Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is apparent from the documents kept that this research had reached the trial stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German army, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a rocket hunting photoelectric, designed by the engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the press, and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" of an author referred to as Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects were intended military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of use of the technique of the rockets were conducted by the scientific advisory committee provisional ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war put an end to its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to the aeronautical were published in the Polish press, thanks to the company astronautics Polish (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a question of a society in the number of November 1954 in the Problem log, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aviation.
In one of these articles, written by professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company devoted to the cosmonautics
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had of the future.
At the beginning of the year 1956, the company astronautics Polish (PTA) made efforts to enter the Russian astronautics international (founded in 1951) and, from the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the federation of astronautics international.
He preserved his office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA brought a significant contribution to the development success of the rocket weather RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first rocket Polish to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 metres, and had a length of 80 cm tall and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
By the suite was built an improved version, RM-1A and, during the summer of 1959, tests of rocket flight, two-storey RM-2 were started in the desert of Bledov.
This rocket had a length of 1.4 metres and weighed probably 11.5 kg.
The following prototype would have to be able to conduct scientific work, concrete - the rocket RM-34 would have had to have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963, all development works were stopped.
The rocket Meteor-1 developed in the course of the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded to the first rockets of type RM.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and a starting weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and 1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the size of the space reserved for the scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had a space with a volume of 0.4 litre, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liter and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liter.
The maximum capacity of all of these types of gear was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the rocket Meteor-2 were developed in the aerospace institute, the first test flight began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Thereafter were built versions Meteor-2 and Meteor-3.
It is also appropriate to mention the entrance of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In the framework Interkosmos program, Poland has also participated in the space exploration on the soviet satellites artificial and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second cosmonaut non-soviet of this program.

The repeal of the act on the work of public utility is not a solution.
Last week, the constitutional Court repealed the law on the work of public utility.
This decision raised in public opinion a lively discussion.
It is definitely worthwhile to consider this issue from a wider point of view.
The economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of greater competition, economic unregulated.
This means that the different economic entities, as well as national business systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and the free traffic (without limits) of private capital, combined with a financial speculation rampant.
The significant differences in the price of labour (wages) generate a voltage on the price.
It should be put under this term the following meaning: a producer strives for the import of the goods sold at low cost to resist the economic competition by " making it more expensive, " the price of the competitor, in order to remove a larger share of the market and thereby increase their own profits.
Large-scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either to move production abroad, or to buy at lower price, either disappear. The result is high unemployment in countries where the price of the work are high in comparison to other economies.
Given that private capital has no responsibility for the social point of view and responsibility in relation to the unemployment which it engenders, the social charges of the State necessarily go up.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate the damage to economic and social caused to the society as a whole by this race to profit.
This situation is at such a point of publicly known that it is not necessary to provide statistical data concrete.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital engender in the various economies, a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in a mutual competition to lower artificially the social level of their own population in order to attract them to the foreign capital.
In other words, governments set their own population at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments of the laws in force.
The objective is to compel economically its own population to accept the dictates of the price of private capital, in particular in the field of wages.
This happens on the one hand by a system of economic constraints, in the case of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of the labour legislation.
This results in an increase in poverty and the deepening of the differences between the rich and the poor.
In GERMANY, there are years of points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
Already by the millions, the number of such people.
In the course of the increase of the competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such salaries as the State is forced to pay extra so that they reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal, for example, has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries to the federal parliament.
The economies of practically all the member States of the south of the EU generate, without any doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the Nineteenth century), is to plod along with poverty wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital to invest in their country.
Here we must ask yourself the following question: where will this capital ?
If it originates from other EU countries, then poverty will increase from one country to another; this capital may not come, or when a Chinese, an Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, or Africa will continue to work for a fraction of a salary european.
This also concerns the whole of Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media, claim to be tired of it, that the State may not make capital investments in its own economy, that the economy led to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital fiercely defends the idea that the State may not intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
It should then ask if the private capital does not influence and, likewise, does not lead today, according to his own selfish interests, the political and at the same time, the State as a whole.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there are a lobby virtually all-powerful and present in all States.
This results in a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by the granting of mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible, but not punishable.
In GERMANY, the situation is such that, because of the lack of financial means, the national ministries delegate the development of projects of laws, law firms closely related to the industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
All the power does not come from the people, as reported by the constitutions of the western type, but powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is manifest that the democracies oriented towards liberalism are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "the crisis of the roman empire in the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in full decline and functions were assigned to it by the violence.
The blows of the bribes, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The kickbacks and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voice already sold"... ... " honest people will not be sought in any way to get functions, the result was a time that the State remained 8 months without consuls".... ' We began really to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was an autocracy, and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... It is true that Appianos had in mind Pumped, but it is Cesar, who has transformed irreversibly democracy in absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, the current society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard to the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, the private capital is no longer able to understand and to represent the interests of the society as a whole.
As a result, today as in the past, a decadence without prior elites, without any effort to perform in-depth reforms.
So we must look for the causes of the emergence of the fascist and communist regimes in the liberalisation of the unscrupulous economic systems of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries.
In the current state of things, we can consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of democracies type liberal as a kind of break before a new stage.
The fact that the elites in present completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of human lives, humanitarian crises, and social development that today we are the witnesses as well as crimes against humanity as we know from the ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the act on the work of public utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of the economic competition, both at international level and at the level internal europe, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look at ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic effect.
The solution consists of the reforms to be referred to the socio-political, which will strengthen the capital investments of the State in the economy, will increase influence of the citizens on the government and will weaken the position of the monopoly of private capital in the company to the benefit of the State.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"There's nothing that will never go out of violence and never will," says Sting in the song called Fragile whose towards the main chorus is "let us not forget how much we are fragile".
" If my sons did not want wars, there would be no", said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his bed of death in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip, as usual, many of the reactions are high.
Some take advantage of Israel, arguing that its right to self-defence, and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others argue the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel and the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine, and recognising Israel as a terrorist State.
I don't want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its wave of killings recurrent; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, are born in the present political situation and have not lived the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view located "behind the curtain", about the one who primarily benefit from the tensions that have existed already for more than 95 years (as of the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a little country in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others out of my own understanding of one, or more exactly of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the story of a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find an Alexander the Great, or a Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these individuals were acting independently or as if they were their acts to the throne to someone who was directing their actions according to the objectives defined beforehand.
We must admit that we live in a time where the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of financial generating some powers has not been able to do in the course of a single generation.
Among the families with a wealth of astronomical particularly stands out the Rothschild family, who could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader, but I do not rule).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 90s of the Xix century, they have acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts for which they were involved and who had always meant for them to reinforce their power to increase their wealth, or both.
They have shareholdings major in most of the central banks of the world and prepare for or carry out wars against the countries in which they do not yet have such interests (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq 5, after the overthrow Gaddafi's only 4 in the meantime Russia has placed the central bank of russia under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew at the Bank of America Rothschild's the status of the central bank and began to emit during the civil war his own money (government, I hear), and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue own money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was assassinated in 1963, congressman Louis McFadden has been poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the FED to have triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level has led in the years 1859 in 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war had the objective to eliminate the great monarchies state of Europe, the second was to remove the colonialism, including the british, and the third is expected to reduce the world's population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing other than the beginning of a solution such as this) and, in the end, acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then then to propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order to the chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the FED to avoid that not repeated crises such as the ones that they brought in 1907).
After you have managed to trigger the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne of the austro-Hungarian, they destroyed the tsarist Russia in causing the bolshevik revolution.
The first world war ended abruptly by a German surrender without justification, economic and military (the war was no longer necessary to the destruction of the tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the breakup of Austria-Hungary, the power in central Europe.
For a trigger easier the second world war, the bankers have left the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: they have, on the one hand, imposed on Germany of enormous repairs of war and creating the conditions for a radicalization of the masses-depleted (it is enough for them then to place an officer energetic enough, pointing the finger at the guilty, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who was to play the role (she held it actually) fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the Nineteenth century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the zionist movement, whose one of the branches inhaled to the creation of a jewish State, preferably in the area of Judea history with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The declaration of Balfour mentioned above has laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local population Arabic began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The second world war broke out; it is difficult to assess if Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had taken initially; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of Europe's Jews in the concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of the jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the repairs of the war imposed on Germany were at the origin of the second world war, the foundation of the State of Israel has lit a fire can cause a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to trigger this war, the jewish population will be as it was during the second world war, the first victim of the fighting, this time as the arab population or generally muslim in the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people are bitterly divided between the supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the israeli-palestinian conflict, where a wrong begets another wrong according to a circle of violence without end and where it is located, the origin of everything, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire the power over the whole world ?
Here we must make a difference between simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as with us, the international bankers do not offer to the people in the elections as their own candidates.
The current prime minister of Israel, is a typical example of a politician fascisant, loyal with respect to the international bankers, who did everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's membership of the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the strait of Hormuz through which transits 20% of all the oil the world (this corridor naval did a width of only 2 miles), and result in the destruction of the world economy.
In what light appear now the remarks made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and the people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all new born is seen implanted at birth, an electronic chip making him a be totally controlled.
" They are forcing all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to carry on the hand or the forehead, a mark in the red-hot iron, so that he can neither buy nor sell the one who does not bear the name of the beast or the number of his name.
It is necessary to understand: that the one who has a good sense account the figures of this ferocious beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty six."

The film Argo: when it all goes to the worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators composed of students islamists took stormed the u.s. embassy in Tehran and held hostage 52 diplomats.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer to the us administration to a positive outcome, it could not, in effect, give up the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the release of hostages.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, suddenly aggravated later by the bombing of the attempt of the release of the hostages by force.
The diplomats hostages were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations held by the algerian government.
Their fate gave rise to the United States with a wave of solidarity and a sense of anti-iranian.
The debacle iranian contributed strongly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the face of Ronald Reagan to the presidential elections of 1980.
The film Argo, the actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of the story, who was offered a small victory to America.
Just before it is occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After ups and downs are complicated, they found themselves in the residence of the ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the canadian authorities, the CIA was able to make out of Iran through a cover events: they left the country with a canadian passport as members of a film crew came to make of the locations for the filming of a movie to show great science-fiction.
Combination of genres
The plan of the expert exfiltration Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, magazines did state of this film project, press conferences were held, and a production company fictitious had actual offices.
The details of the operation remained a long time secrets, the movie is based on the recollections of Tony Mendez.
The film Affleck is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic manner but also a "caper movie", the story of a hit, a traitor - as, for example, in the trilogy, Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres turn: sequences of Tehran documentary-style (in the sequences, subtitled are presented iconic photographs of the time of the events, and the manner in which, through these pictures, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no major differences),
passages lighter Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions with men dressed discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable manner.
Actor ridiculed, he became a director respected and his acting has continued to attract ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark thriller " Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first film Affleck who should not take place in his city of origin, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above the standard hollywood.
Affleck is also evidence of this sense the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the movie are taking place in the streets, during the reconstruction of the real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests the confusion and the unpredictability that occur when suddenly, at a given location, writing a page of history.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the scenes fictitious (false, the shooting team in the bazaar of Tehran).
Too much stock in too many places
The director had to settle a matter with the fact that few thrilling scenes in cinematic sense of the term.
It gets out of it very well, it adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of a crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the continuation on the runway are quite drawn by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its character dispelled, due to the need to show too much of events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of cooperators hollywood, their characters would have deserved a greater place and not far from there, the only ones in this case.
The film Affleck lack a bit of dramatic tension, he will let you see with a moderate degree of interest, enjoying the realization and the retro style of the 70's.
It takes the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history yet, in some way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the character of an exaggeration of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he is the case.

Rules to inflate balloons, bananas, and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which carries out every year a public inquiry into the bank charges the most absurd, has decided, at present, to launch the contest of the regulation or of the ideas from the " workshop EU" the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU is considering, these last times, to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large european companies has been at the origin of our decision", said to the newspaper Právo the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the european Court of unifying the insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women were at a distinct advantage for this which is of tariffs for life insurance because they are, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report up to the end of the year, while another idea also amazing "the workshop of the EU".
"The vote will take place before the end of the month of February 2013", has informed Nacher.
Among the regulations controversial of the EU is, for example, the obligation to add components bio fuels, and that this has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low amount of a hazardous substance or the directive on the size of cages for hens, which resulted in the increase in the price of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of the use of the expression "butter spread," or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas quality must have a size of 14 inches.
The eu administration reacts often under the pressure of a lobby commercial or industrial whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a State or group of States (and the Czech Republic is currently imposing the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, to the origin of the fact that in the european Union, the bananas must not be of a size less than 14 cm or present an "abnormal curvature".
The european Commission has defended arguing that it was not that harmonizing national standards in non-homogenous compliquaient trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed in spite of the opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives lead to a waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to the regulations of the EU last year, according to which must be listed on the balloons a warning that children under 8 years of age should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has made reference to a u.s. survey, according to which the balls are among the toys, the first cause of child death by choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age to blow the trumpets of the fair.
With us as well, it was bizarre ideas.
The following rule concerning the european officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, any person who has an official function within the EU may not use the name "Macedonia", and shall, at the place, to speak of FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez-Faire" grouping of the liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this survey, in addition to some of the absurdities of the above-mentioned, the regulations of the european Union concerning the volume of reserves of food products on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set volumes maximum for the reserves of food products that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic has exceeded then, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms, and ventured, because of this, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey have found interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to request the granting of subsidies.
These ideas, however, are not originating in Brussels, but of Prague.
"The fact of not having a sea we disability.
We will ask the European Union for a refund". Thus expressed, in the fall of 2004, the minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
It arguait that, as a result of our own production of wheat, and following the purchases so-called "interventionist", the State was found with stocks full that it had to then export.
According Palas, the EU would have had to pay millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is situated away from the ports.
In the end, the european Commission responded positively to the request of the Czech and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without access to the sea.
Subsidies for obtaining grants were offered to the public by the ministry of local Development headed by the minister Pavel jan němec (US-DEU), they should, in practice, be used to write applications for subsidies granted by Brussels.
The EU declares: "the regulations bizarre are rare".
If the regulations are often critical in the member States, according to many experts, the efforts deployed by the EU in relation to the regulation and improvement of the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its general development, deserve rather praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of the european integration, but that have been imposed by the member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic should, like other countries of the Union, to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these products traditional (struggle which it does not always a winner) arouses strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for which the appellation "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to us in the Nineteenth century, our producers have had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only the alcohol-based products cane sugar, and not based on sugar beet, may bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products to the EU, we find today in the company of cheeses known worldwide such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the marzipan of Lubeck or Parma ham, biscuits Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the tents of Pohořelice and Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and the hops Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
The gingerbread Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Cones Hořice " ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their brand community.

People want me to save the Republic, but I am only an amateur, says senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how a-t-on the idea of introducing themselves to the presidential elections ?
This is not to be a senator or president, who account for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate nowhere.
But I can not stand to see how the country is being plundered over the last twenty years, that the thieves are not under lock and key and the taxes and the age of retirement is increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something that I don't like, then I try to provide a solution for it to change.
And as I have over forty years of age and that I am independent, a member of any party, I don't have other ways to influence the situation than to introduce myself to the presidential elections, or to the senate.
You are entered in the Senate but you are quickly put on the road to the Castle (Ndt: the headquarters of the presidency).
Is it that you do not turn our backs on those who have elected ?
I have always said that I'll start it in the battle for the Castle according to the results of the elections to the senate
Subsequently, I have said that if I was elected a senator, I would trust myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, the function is just an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
This is why I need the influence of the largest and the mandate of the bigger picture.
The problem is not only that we as a nation râlons at the bar or in front of our television set, but it is also that we piétinons cough those who are trying to bring about change.
Added to this is the press, which breaks the reputation of individuals and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lying.
It has, for example, said about me that I bribing journalists, or that I was the advisor of Georg Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have initiated the struggle for the Castle, with, as a war-horse of the themes of the material responsibility and criminal politicians and tax returns retroactive beyond twenty million [CZK].
You need to this end, to change the law.
As president, you do not have such a power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you solve this problem ?
When as a citizen, I have been lobbying for the activities of tourist guide constitute a liberal profession, I won the case.
The problem is that the politics: when someone comes to the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of any party, I have a lot more likely to get the support of all the parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, take each party what is best for our country and put it in the application.
Do you consider it rather as a man of the left or the right ?
A point of view, Czech, I have the impression that people put me rather to the left.
For me, this is a bit to the left or to the right, this is not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we go forward.
What counts for me, this is not that people will be left or the right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the communist party or ODS, and I do everything as impartially against bad ideas.
Are you enragez when someone says to you that you are a populist ?
But what you have said does not prove't it ?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain purpose and optimal vision.
You try to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I'm talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken about this.
But without the support of the parliament, it only remains for you slogans.
You will not survive a long time in politics with this.
Do you think that if you're going to see the people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, to impose liability and criminal ?
I have no other option.
I need to convince politicians, journalists and the public opinion and try to bring them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on tv my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on liability and criminal politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then possibly explain why they didn't want it.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify the abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it has been obtained thanks to the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without beating about the bush, to be a lover, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my beliefs and visions.
I just throw myself in politics and I am attempting to get the support of the majority for my program.
I try, alone, doing things, and if it doesn't, I'll be staying in six years and I will return in the private sector.
It's a bit like if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, that is why I went to see a number of people to ask them to present also to the senatorial elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová which has revealed the fraud in the oil.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people have not voted and who did it were, for the most part, given their voices to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent.
The people have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
In spite of everything, I will contend for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of the regions.
Are you planning to build your own party ?
No, not yet, because I don't have the time to check if the past of each potential member is without spot, and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have no more money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my account "transparent".
You don't have money ?
You talk of tax declarations, what's yours ?
I estimate to be approximately $ 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have to Prague, with a land value of $ 25 million, an apartment with a value of ten million, another apartment worth $ 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin, which is worth $ 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb with a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a dream of a kid: I've always liked James Bond, who was travelling in the car, was galant with women and fought against the evil and abuse.
You ride in Aston Martin, you have a heritage with a value of 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign ?
You want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money ?
This is not very convincing.
I don't have $ 15 million for this campaign.
I ought to go into debt ?
I have already invested 2 million and a half in the countryside.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program does not arouse a great interest.
I do not have the obligation to pay this campaign out of my pocket.
My fees campaign are broadly covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live, for example to pay the English school my son, who is 30 thousand per month.
If my only goal was to win the money, I do not present myself to any election.
You will, therefore, continue your business activities in order to be able to live ?
Didn't you have said that you would put your activities muted ?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take in the spring the direction of the travel agency.
The people would like that I am a samaritan who saves the Republic.
Yet, it should be even though I live in something.
What was your monthly salary usual when you were a contractor ?
I was making and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business activities.

The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To be convinced of this, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly-erected - 2 photos
"I find that this building is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," we said Lisette Verhaig, a bandwidth-on the down-side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer technician in a large company neighbor, we said: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need today a library.
Everyone has Internet, iPad, and e-books.
Today, nobody will of his own accord in one of these libraries lame, right?
Spijkenisse, a city-dormitory, which was not attractive to the doors of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the education rates the lowest of the Low Countries.
In order to restore some neurons in the brains, the city has decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven bridges fictitious which are listed on the euro notes in the form of small lovely miniature reinforced concrete painted.
The success of the offensive cultural remained limited.
It is as well that the city authorities have realized that there was only one way to take the lead on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the office of architects MVRDV, Rotterdam, the master of the diagrams in the sticks bold and creator of buildings full of spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his phlegm usual, and stood in the contest in 2003 with five books under one arm and a sneer on the face.
And while the members of the jury looked at each other again, bewildered, and shrugging his shoulders, Maas, the cheeky, empila its books of choice for size order to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by arguments activists by one: "dear common!"
Here it is, my proposal to the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has sprung from the earth.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and terraced houses for a total of 50 units.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books received the second prize of "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project has been selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus it is that this little village dull, which up to now had nothing more to offer than a pedestrian area postmodern and a town hall of a ugliness bewildering, whose facades white invite you to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched with an architectural masterpiece contemporary.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now has the first building cultural public of its history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under bell cheese.
Certainly, an elevator carries you to the heart of the mountain, but the true joys of reading, and that the architecture will open up to you when you touch the ground floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.
The interior completely made of glass is bright and clear, the brick floor and Dutch street elegant speak the unequivocal language of the public places of the municipality.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
One is looking for is already in the eyes of the public benches, dogs and little boys and little girls who play the ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally, the rays of the library are located along the facade and in the middle is a big room and dark, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely upset the spatial configuration classic and open spaces reading from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skilfully furnished: in the middle are the offices, the library, the Internet, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical centre of the building.
A special beauty lies in the black spokes of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair railings.
A new experience to the sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the building hardened do not want to unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project from the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is so that one day we found in a farming business frisian waste ad hoc derived from agriculture.
In the netherlands, it has been using for years of the synthetic membrane of a millimeter thick as substrates in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and it will save time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons and then we can discard it.
For the library, the membrane has been compressed, for the first time in such quantities, in plates with a thickness of four inches.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic " (KPL) changes color and becomes a dark material, homogeneous and strong, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sport shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary cafe we offer a breathtaking view of the city, but also food and Dutch and ficus trees in pots.
These create an atmosphere, but they contribute especially to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity in the air of the mountain literary.
Gifts for the new soul
"It is incredible, but in spite of all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in the field of ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is set by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a bell-glass, the sun illuminates as little time inside, even when the weather is nice.
The thick wooden beams mounted through compared to the glass facade used visor, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The blinds completely automated load of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the computer scientist septic the above-mentioned, it is already risky to enter into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig as was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as "the soul finally found," Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago in effect, during the inauguration, every citizen was asked to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure has helped to fill in the gaps of the library, which was not yet completely filled (today, it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The shelves are full of all shares.
For the architect, Winy Maas, "there is nothing worse than a library is half-empty."
"I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each and every citizen, and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it is only for decoration."
It is as well that MVRDV has reached the discipline mistress called in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page in literary history.
Even if it may appear young and little-educated.
It is, finally, a new starting point for the birth of an identity.

Szabo: "the Germans must play a bigger role."
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of the palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert of the relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin in a fragile political situation.
Deutsche Welle: In the beginning of the week, Germany had announced his intention to vote against the demand of the palestinians to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations.
But she was then chosen forbearance.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not agree with what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the american position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in march 2011, Germany had also abstained in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, the NATO-imposed this measure.
Germany is experiencing, " she difficulties to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is in the process of reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to say, defined by the Americans and to establish a foreign policy of germany.
In addition, the lack of coherent policy and common within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are encountering so many fronts.
Is expected of them, they play a more independent role, but they are not accustomed.
I believe that they are groping to find this role, but are on the way of foreign policy "more normal".
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
That then means in concrete terms, the term of foreign policy "normal" for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States and european partners, including in relation to the national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the middle East.
The economic interests of the germans are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other great powers: this is why Germany needs to protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced the position of Germany vis-a-vis the conflict in the middle East and the abstention in the vote of the United Nations?
Germany was first to significant opportunities in the middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why the Berlin must take care not to offend the public opinion, but also the elites in the arab countries.
It is undoubtedly a crucial element.
However, I would match not too much importance, because it is not a question of relationship exclusively one-sided.
But it is there, in any case, a key element in the strategic reflections German.
Germany night-she's relations with the United States in choosing abstaining votes are important, such as in the case of Palestine?
I think that the Americans and Europeans understand perfectly the German position.
This is why I think that the divide is not so serious as it was in the case of the libyan question.
Maybe even that Germany will be more respected.
Indeed, Germany has demonstrated that it needs to be taken seriously as an international actor and that his interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions of the palestinian initiative are various.
By contrast, the United States have announced their veto in a clear voice.
Opinions differ between the United States and the majority of european countries?
There have always been differences because of the scene in american domestic policy.
I believe that the Obama Administration is secretly showed great understanding for the european position.
But having regard to the political configuration of the country, the government may not, of course, not defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they appear still.
If you observe the relationships between Obama and israeli prime minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing enthusiasm with regard to the policy of the Netanyahu.
Germany feels it difficult to combine his close relations with Israel and the United States, of the one part, with the position of the major european partners, on the other hand?
I think it does not make things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, this would be a bit more easy for the Germans there were a coherent european policy and uniform, but today, this is not the case.
Therefore they cannot register within a line broader policy and must assert their peculiar position.
This is what they are currently in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will assume in the future the role of a locomotive and will push Europe to adopt a european position.
This is not simple for Germany, in particular because of the relations with Israel.
This question has always been tricky.
But according to me, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that brand more of their independence.
Germany sees itself playing a role of an influential player on the international stage, Germany wants-she only assume a key role?
Or maybe she still struggling to assume leading roles?
Germany is still not used to that, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still experiences difficulties to play a more important role.
If you look at, for example, the crisis of the euro, we note that each time that Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands are heard.
It does not make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by countries hostile.
From this point of view, Germany is in a position to be far more difficult than the United States.
It must cope with neighbors and opinions very diverse, and this is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on the eu policy does not only diminish, but at this moment, the EU does not empty, then who is he?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if it does not like, even if it is unpleasant, and if they are less valued, this is the life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy of Washington, beauty in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America to analyse together the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he majored in German politics, american foreign policy and transatlantic relations.

"Trademark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become chinese
Armani and Ralph Lauren Polo are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really?
The name behind a registered trademark officially in China, but that has nothing to do with the company's original.
The brand has a protection such as the company that bears the name may not file a complaint.
And even if it could, it is not sure that she would be successful.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China", explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the right of property in the Far East.
Each week, a new file arrives on my desk.
The imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.
So, instead of Gucci, we register Read-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copy, such as Puma, the sporting goods manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a workbook in which are the records made with the trademark office of Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a chinese company has filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created by appropriating a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the house of mode.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of the copy and the violation of the intellectual property.
In the big cities, we find shopping centres, multi-storied do not sell almost as counterfeits.
The case of Pattloch, however, are different: its constituents, the task of addressing the fact that the chinese trademark office gives officially to chinese enterprises the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of the "Bang Mingpai", brand parent.
The term is derived from the "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that are referred to as the women who are married to rich men.
The chinese authorities say they have nothing to be ashamed of.
"It is bad for business, it is necessary to struggle against this tendency", requires Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation are huge."
The financial losses and legal costs amounting to millions for the relevant sectors, especially in regard to the flagship products expensive.
According to the data of the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market of luxury goods and the one that is developing most rapidly.
However, it is not easy to write off the questionable records of the registry of trade marks and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch is state of the trial in which the court has rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name was criticized become a "market reality".
Pattloch we explained that if the complainant did not chance, it may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because it would have harmed its brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Of the famous cases also concern the graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the manufacturer of machine construction Sany, the same company that had to buy the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
This is the reason why the Chinese can use a symbol that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the acquisiteur Volvo used before a blue and white logo similar to that of the BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had the change.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore, which had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The trademark office of CTMO in Beijing admits, however, have experienced some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have happened in the last year of an "emergency situation in the conduct of the work to a sense of normality found".
Thus, the number of opposition procedures are not treated, would have fallen to 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures are still pending at the office.
Act is expensive
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year, the CTMO has received more than 1.4 million applications filing of a trademark application, almost one-third more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record, and this means that China stands for the tenth time in a row in the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
It would be also for the total number of trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each record has reported average 1,280 yuan, or about 160 euros.
A legal battle is much more, as illustrated in the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company is fighting a plagiarist chinese.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacturing of components of the vehicle to be suspended.
However, the imitator has been able to maintain its rights chinese on the brand Freudenberg.
"It is our fault, because the names of the family may not be protected in Germany", explains Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office had therefore dismissed the objection of Munich.
Freudenberg has certainly won the case with the two following instances, but the opposing party continued to fight until today.
Vigilance is warranted
Today, the case is pending before the supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: " the procedure is long, nerve-wracking and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the other party a "large sum in euros at the six-digit" to resolve the dispute.
"This is one sees that this represents for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten even spill over into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators of this region accounted for the operation of the brands are not protected.
For example, a chinese producer wanted to drop in Germany the name of the Freudenberg for a company of production of footwear and leather.
The company had long since abandoned this area, but she could still prevent the deposition.
Wentzler adds: "vigilance is warranted".
Pattloch and advised to German companies to exercise a high degree of caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, relying on the international law of trademarks, foreigners should rather "save as in China which is likely to be protected", as the saying Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs may be much more important than those of the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle when the last act of the drama legal, the company would have to pay license fees to the other party for the use of his own name, as explained in Wentzler.
Or, we would lose our place on the segment of the market in question.

World day of struggle against aids: type of walk, to sing, to help
The choir Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and the aids orphans in Swaziland are looking forward to their arrival.
Here is the story of a link which crosses more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, you tap your foot: the cowboy boots, sneakers, shoes for ladies and moccasins for men seek the pace on the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they will find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers amplify slowly - alto, bass, soprano and tenor -, they will prevail, spellbinding and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the conductor 29-year-old lost almost his canvas shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures flexibility wild.
We are Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers from 23 to 69 years are come, the geneticist in human medicine at the man in the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, every singer has different words, all in a language very exotic: the zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some regions of Swaziland.
Be helped to help themselves
UNAIDS, the United Nations programme of fight against aids, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are living with the disease.
23.5 million of them live in the South of Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is hiv positive.
180 aids orphans in the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros per least, one can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees a child of money for the school, a school uniform and a hot meal daily to the centre galore.
Imbongi means in zulu, "storyteller", or even "singer of praise".
No one can fluently speak the bantu language in this region, but all can sing.
For nearly 10 years, the choir repeats of the songs in this foreign language, it has brought Germany to now make it to his native region: Southern Africa.
Because 8,733 km as the crow flies of Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the power voice of the choir German.
40% of people with
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in small huts made of straw or of land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has washed away their parents.
To Esitjeni, one can observe a smaller scale the ills that plague the Swaziland: the rate of HIV infection the most high, and life expectancy is the lowest in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population does not accept almost never male circumcision, a measure which, nevertheless, ensures a reduction proven risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is the bearer of the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the thirties.
During a trip of the group in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis have especially seen many of the children in the street on which it lacked not only the parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a high school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At the beginning, it was only a few people who commit personally to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and to provide him with a hot meal per day.
But just a year later, the choir was founded "Voices for Africa", an association that deals since then almost professional orphaned by aids Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are sexually transmitted diseases the most common?
Among the bacterial STIS, syphilis, chlamydiées and gonorrhoea (or gonorrhea).
STIS are common to HIV, the human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to the IST parasitic.
What are the groups mainly concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea often appear among men who have sex with other men.
The Institute Robert-Koch believes that sexual contact between men, are at the origin of at least four cases of syphilis on five were in Germany.
In the adult heterosexual, infections related to the chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhoea and the human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
Among young people, there is a rate of infections related to the chlamydiées significantly higher than among other population groups.
According to surveys in the eu, the three-quarters of all infections affecting young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution in the number of infections?
It is not compulsory to declare all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Institute Robert-Koch, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure has risen to 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreases.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses at the level of genitals, pain in urinary tract, white discharge, pain in the abdomen, as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not lead to regularly no pain or other symptoms and so remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by infection lubricating or through close body contact.
So experts recommend to anyone often changing sex partners to have regular exams.
Most of the IST quickly detected can be healed and the late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially to the funds that are reaping the singers with their voices across Germany as a whole, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman self-assured and always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated in one of their grand-mothers, for example.
The gogos, it is the so-called old women in zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them can accommodate up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof, and ensure that they go every day to the hour to the school in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one is hosted in a secure place, in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just as the two cooks who prepare daily meals to more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the "Voices for Africa," has created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two houses. With the assistance of the organization of american health PSI, the association has organized a screening test for HIV for many people.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"Aids is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that affects sexuality."
It is curious enough, coming from a country whose king has 14 wives official.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, the King Mswati III, is known for its style of life to be excessive.
Polygamy in the place of democracy.
These manners sanctioned by the State, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV has been observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
However, we find condoms at every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some of the cultural exchange, the chorus of Imbongi go together on a trip every two or three years in the South of Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence, and black identity that the number of inhabitants of the tip of the black continent are still in the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with white singing in african language is a sign of recognition as it not only results in a good mood and joy, but hard sometimes also a tear to some fearsome border guards.
The bus takes them always to Esitjeni, where the singers visit to their downline.
Even if it is difficult to find the little village on top of a map, Esitjeni is well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you'll find the light", say the people there.
And after a journey of 8,733 km as the crow flies, return to Heidelberg, in front of these singers who type of the foot in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Strasse, there is also the light.

Messenger: the NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The layer of ice that could reach 20 meters thick.
The u.s. space agency NASA has proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it has frozen water, as explained in three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Messenger probe has reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly immersed in the shade.
This coverage would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters of up to 20 metres.
The water is probably due to comets or asteroids that might hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of the presence of life on the planet, says the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery may help to understand how the water and other elements essential to life arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Undetected of the inhabitants of our planet, sensors, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the land, such small interstices through which we observe the infinite.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not regarded as a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the international astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the telescope, the Spitzer space telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and pink dots, the more difficult to identify, as are the "new-born" in the delivery room of the universe.
The telescope, the Spitzer space telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a name well-bit romantic, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
The telescope, NASA's Spitzer space has photographed the fiery glow of a star is dying.
The circle in the shape of a donut is composed of elements that the star plans when she dies.
In the immense nebula Trifide, at 5,400 light-years from Earth, the gas and dust form new stars.
The telescope, the Spitzer space telescope has photographed this delivery room galactic.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more colors in value.
On this infrared camera, the Helix nebula, like a red eye, looking directly at the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarities with a continent land have earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal picture and the infrared camera allows you to observe a hue spectacular.
Only the detectors infrared telescope Spitzer were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the biggest mysteries in astronomy door on the creation of the rings of Saturn.
One theory is that the rings are the remnants of a moon of Saturn, which has disappeared, there is 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.

According to the hue, the photographs of spiral galaxies can become a real works of art.
The photograph published by the european southern Observatory shows the nebula Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, to several thousand light-years.
The name of Trifide comes from the latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the heart sheen of the place of birth of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a pile of space in the constellation of the serpent bearer: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of the two galaxies merge rush towards one another, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope has observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like the abbreviations techniques, you can use its nickname of "the wheel of fire southern".
The photo from the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the nebula of the Iris, in the constellation of Céphée.
The nebula is located 1,400 light-years and is composed of dust grains, which are ten to a hundred times smaller than the dust domestic current.
This photo has been prepared on the basis of shots optical and x-ray taken by the various telescopes.
One can see there the circle composed of black holes is 430 million light-years from the Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for the NASA this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273.
Scientists have named the larger spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the group of young stars the brightest of our milky way galaxy.
The cradle heavenly always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the nebula of the Rosette, also create continuously young stars to 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy, the sun's rays and breakthrough of a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is gas.
The scientists believe that he was born soon after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilee to use it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see deeper into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Observatory of the mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, in the United States, is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma in the Canary islands, is immense. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to make savings.
The diameter reaches approximately eleven metres.
The disadvantage of the method of economic construction is that the telescope is set at the level of the vertical angle, which limits the disabled.
The telescope Hobby-Eberly, Texas is also set at the level of the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity lies in its high light-gathering ability.
In spite of a diameter of the mirror relatively small, this ability is similar to those of the largest telescopes in the mirrors of the world.
The scientists listen to the universe in search of signals extra-terrestrial using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope with a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person owning a computer can help in the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI, or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence") through the contributions of the computing power of his machine.
Views of the european southern Observatory (ESO), in the chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a facility worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The construction of a european extremely large telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of the ESO) in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 items of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take snapshots before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered to be the biggest in the world.
They wore two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the observatory on Mauna Kea, observing the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new telescope gigantic should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of the mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration helps to admire it.
However, the images of the space-the most important we come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he delivers us with images of the far worlds.
Since march 2009, the Kepler space telescope searches for exoplanets, primarily those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that she had found 1,235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the final preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James webb space-Webb (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the space telescope infrared has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will be on a mission to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
The scientists believe that the South pole of Mercury is also home to the ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory does not exist, because Messenger orbit much closer to the North pole of Mercury.
The radar data indicated, for decades, the presence of ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, the scientists now have the certainty.

Drink daily butter, and live up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, which is still relatively young in 97 years.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, which is still relatively young in 97 years.
The trip in the mountains Talysh is a romance disheveled.
At the turn of the many turning points of the road, the small bus jounces along the wooded hills, rivers pouring and farms modest.
Everything is green and fertile, it is almost like in the Black Forest.
But we find ourselves here in the deep South of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
It is here that lives ethnic group caucasian name of Talysh, about which we do not know much, if not they speak perfectly Persian and azeri and they have a very long service life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastronne with its architecture too aggressive from the soviet period that do not fit at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to traverse the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one way.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth, the country needs its oil reserves in the Caspian sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Baku has become famous in may thanks to the Eurovision song contest, and the next year, here there will be the festival of the people of the oldest in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of the longevity, the only museum of the kind in the world.
We can discover the life of approximately eight tens of Talysh of the region, which has more than 100 years. Fatulayeva we watch a black and white photo.
Here is my grand-father, he has reached the age of 120 years.
Still have a child 136 years
But the star of the controversial museum is Shirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have had 168 years.
However, there is not a birth certificate.
And when you think that the oldest person documented was 122 years, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and he would have had 23 children. At the age of 136 years, it would still have designed a girl.
Shirali Müslümov would he cheated of a few decades in calculating his / her age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, he has also heard of the man at the grand old age of central Asia.
"People surprisingly older live also in some regions of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia also, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof due to the non-existence of documents, not to mention that there was no register of civil status.
Each day, a glass of melted butter
It is, however, of the fact that the people of the region, Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of the country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the tourist guide of azerbaijan, says that the Talysh have specific genes.
However, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a question of power.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the calorie meals of the Talysh, who like meat, bread, and especially dairy products, and many of which are drinking a daily glass of melted butter, are good for the health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of the people? To Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see in the whole region of Caucasus.
She is sitting on the ground next to a churn, which it beats the content tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, among which one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a girl, who are for a long time adults.
Two small children enjoy also in the house.
In the kitchen, preparing tea for the guests served in glasses armadus typical in the form of a belly.
The white teeth of Mirzayeva, are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf hide long braids of a dark blond that his son reveals to us with pride.
I always washed my hair with milk, and it is as well that I've never lost and that they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo", adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She always ate what comes from its own farm: tomatoes, potatoes, and peas.
In my entire life, I've never bought the lesser food in a supermarket.
Then, she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst times were after the Second world War.
But everything is improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the controls.
The language of propaganda amazing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the father figure of the nation, a man who, however, has led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He has been in power until 2003, his son Ilham he was succeeded by the suite.
Anyway, the older people of Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount in euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good train of life in the region.
And may be that the son for a long time grizzled of Mirzayeva was right: "the elders have a great respect for it in our culture."
They are the center of the large family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.

The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Events rival reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial.
The egyptian president is not stingy lyrics filled with emotions.
We need to make a successful transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God", a-t-he told State television.
His speech was intended for the people as a whole, but also especially to the Coptic christian, liberal, enlightened muslims and secular.
Because all of the members of the opposition confused and desperate désunie are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful muslim brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologetically, have temporarily restricted the powers of the constitutional Court and expanded his own "in order to save the revolution".
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what he wants to save this engineer 61 years old, holder of a doctorate degree from the american university of Southern California.
The judiciary will it be reversed?
The 234 articles written in haste by the constituent assembly predominantly islamic 100 people during a tour-de-force night of fifteen hours are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the decision is based on "the principles of islamic law".
But that really means the word "principles" ?
This was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the islamists use the vague wording and the margin of manoeuvre legal caused to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it's that suggests an article newly introduced stipulating that, in respect of all matters related to the shari'ah, al-Azhar university should be consulted. The hotel is in an islamic institution, the most important of the country and its brilliance shines on all the islamic sunni world.
This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative instrument, which would de facto lead to the under supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of the likely military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts employed to suppress the opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, can you read in the project, to protect "the true nature of the egyptian family" and "to promote its corporate and its values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions of the State could even control the content of the art cinema and literature.
In the clear, it would be simply to censorship.
In addition, any article not specifically guarantees the equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbidden to offend or defame the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what is an offense, nor how it must be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording implying that it is prohibited to"offend the people".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke at the expense of a man of law?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the project that the minister of interior shall submit to the vote and who, according to his own words, will "very soon" the object of a referendum of the Egyptians.
"The revolution renait"
The opposition is mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of the islamists.
Friday evening, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in a concorde unusual in Tahrir square, Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia law before it comes into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win", lance Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential election.
The Nobel peace prize winner and former chief of the international Agency for atomic energy agency, Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft Constitution is "to throw it into the dustbin of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Israel of wanting to foment a "coup against democracy".
"It proclaims the referendum, it will go to his palace and the overthrow it", exclaims Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brethren is not yet atoned for," said according to the egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and a member of the opposition .
In addition, several judges have announced do not want to monitor the referendum, which would entail its invalidity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
From its side, the muslim brotherhood, well-organized, has called for a counter-demonstration was not on the Tahrir square, as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the university of Cairo.
The veiled women and the followers of the salafi, who participated in large numbers, were chanting: "the people calling for the application of the law of God."
"Cleans our country!", asked to the minister of interior, stating that "the Qur'an [was] Constitution".
A fight for the sovereignty over the symbolic place Tharir, where it all began, would have quickly led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what the supporters of the minister of interior and wanted to avoid.
The muslim Brothers have stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, in the same way that his followers were cast loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the ballot box of the direction the country.
The project of the islamists will definitely the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned a single time"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed that would have had to extend until February and encompass all social forces.
The lawyer of the human rights of 48 years old and president of the egyptian Organization for human rights (EOHR), had defended the muslim Brothers when they were in prison or in front of the courts under Mubarak.
He did not because he was sharing their conception of the world, but because for him, the human rights are indivisible.
This is the reason for which he has been beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution", regrette-t-il during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of the powers of the minister of interior and to the three powers, has discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are glaring violations of the rules of democracy, and they will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the president removes de facto all its powers", deplores Saeda.
Nevertheless, a democracy can not function without the civil society organizations.
Saeda feels left out, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid for.
A protester on the site Tharir warns: "you give birth to a monster that it will no longer be possible to control."

The rakfisk of Norway: is it the fish the most fragrant of the world?
The five million people who live in Norway have one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could be linked to the appetite of the premises for a fish extremely fragrant?
Take cheeses advanced.
Place them in the middle of a pile of clothes football wet and dirty.
Wait a week.
And you get the smell disturbing the rakfisk, dishes the most sought after areas of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It's snowing, the scenery is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in the water for a period - according to the scent that you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness sets in and it is cold, the Norwegian gather en masse to attend a festival which has been held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this culinary specialty incredible.
"You eat it raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Harvard Halvarsen, firefighter local full-time, also known as the "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, the people swallow small pieces of fish, and will put a large quantity of drink.
"Some people prefer the aquavit in rakfisk", adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid doing so pass under your nose, this is not bad - it makes me think of a sushi which would have spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in barrels of water-tight to the air, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once properly fermented, the fish is released and - no doubt with the sense undermined by the alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians have been forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating, mainly to the United States.
At present, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, high wages and a system of complete health.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was there not so long ago richer than Norway, crossing the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital element, although fragrant, of the past of Norway.
This is part of the dishes more expensive.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 euros each.
Norway did not often talk about it in the news international, which is not to displease him.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who has killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this slaughter, they talk about the "incident of 22 July".
The Norwegians have trouble accepting that in their country and the pacific, the one of their own has been able to commit such an act of barbarism.
Since the beginning of the 70's, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason which justifies our success," says Anna, our waitress, blonde hair and blue eyes piercing, the image of the well-being nordic, with a tray of rakfisk hand.
We are - how to say-you - cautious people.
His English, like that of most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discrete, we do not like us to notice.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with a lot of caution - all, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out of the window, in the course of the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has been able to keep the cords of his purse tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk", she adds in a carefree laugh.
I am standing in the snow and I line up to buy me something to eat - I've had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger made up of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But this evening, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stayed is one of the many places where one serves rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or, perhaps, for the most fragrant of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter has a bow-butterfly, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It is like the Eurovision song contest.
"What's the score have you given to the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it is because of the fumes of fish.

The mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is experiencing a difficult start.
As the incoming Chairman Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, focuses on the challenges ahead and to the expectations of the people, who are many.
The traffic in Mexico city is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a dam safety has been put in place since Monday, blocking several road access key in the capital and causing a real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent persons from going to work, but to prevent the demonstrators from reaching the Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the scarf presidential to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task ahead of him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results that we owe to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already cost the lives of around 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the people of mexico : to reduce the violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto the american President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy, which will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before you introduce it to the american president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and sprawling which surrounds the capital. On its frontier, the opinions about this new leader are divided.
A man live
In the common picturesque Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The local attribute to him the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the town, you can take one of the new highways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of cracks.
Plates emblazoned with his name is hung on the outside of a new sports complex and an interactive museum impressive dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to put in place lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and the party of M Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economics in particular, we expect a real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years without flaw in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox.
The member of the congress Olvera admits that after 12 years out of the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are a lot of expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents who claim that the new president of lacking charisma.
It is a whole man, very committed, with a great vision for the country.
This is a great statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
To Nezahualcoyotl, also known as the Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of the Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under the autoponts motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico city.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier in the year, the military has been called in to help in the fight against the gangs of drug, which operate in the districts, and violence against women are particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, was found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women who were murdered in the past two years.
More than 1,000 women have been killed in the state of Mexico, whereas Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place notorious for the number of innocent women who were killed.
Critics of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, it has not managed to curb the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration to refuse to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this area dilapidated, Irinea Buendia struggle to hold back his tears when she shows me photos of his daughter defunct, Mariana Luna.
The official version states that a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family think she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at it, it seemed to me that his body had been washed," the Lady of the Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the rigor mortis had already begun.
While his mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana decorates the wall, next to a cross where is the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities me were treated as if I was an old woman, a fautrice disorder, a pleurnicheuse.
They want to accept what they say and it is silent.
"But this is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions", she said.
When the President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, it will be a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by the crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has made the promise that he would make it his top priority during his tenure.
"I hope it will be as good as the president, when he was governor," said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.

Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, according to prosecutors.
The prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of child abuse, including Bradley Manning to have been the victim during detention.
The trial door on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that the sequestration of Manning was made in extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to demonstrate, Friday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being at the origin of the biggest leak of confidential information from the history of the us army -- has missed many opportunities to complain of ill-treatment which he claims to have suffered during his detention in the military.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Prosecutor Shift. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits made to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention at Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaint about his treatment.
The cross-examination -- in the course of a hearing, the defence filed a motion demanding that the case Manning to be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping was made in very difficult conditions and has built up a punishment severe enough -- took place a day after that Manning has expressed its desire to commit suicide while in detention.
This analyst of military intelligence, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein has examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison in Quantico, where he was subjected to isolation prison maximum of July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions to Manning and have recorded their answers.
When Fein spoke of the forms, Friday, Manning has recognized that the treatment that have booked him his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had been at the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not show any complaint for ill-treatment, although the officers were directly questioned about his treatment in prison, said Fein.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about some of the problems and that the officers visit had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would, but they have not documented the problems discussed.
"They wrote, "no problem" (after having addressed the concerns), and so far, this does not mean that I did not raise problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, has also asked Manning why he had not complained of his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission, which was convened to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed by written a few months before.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his status restrictive indicating a "risk of injury".
The military reported that it had assigned this status restrictive -- a level below the close monitoring of the risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was okay, and I wanted it possible for me to remove this status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison of the base of the Marine Corps at Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide when he was in Kuwait and has fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact of not having been informed of what was going to happen to him, or of what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, in this cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects to which it was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothing, and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleep or lie down during the day was contrary to the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, it was a light in the eyes, turned on the outside of his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned the night, they were waking up in order to be able to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning has filed a formal complaint to the treatment suffered by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Friday also, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony Thursday -- that, after having been forced to sleep naked all night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates, one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time, it has not been possible to cover with a blanket during the call.
During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his custody that he had to let go of its cover, which would be able to hide her nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked on the previous night, because it would have been trying to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning is reported to have said to the officer that he would have been able to use the elastic of her panties or its flip-flops to get hurt, but that he had not done it.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers are hoping that at least the judge will take into account the experiences during his detention and that it will greatly reduce his sentence if he were to be convicted before a court martial, a trial that is expected to be held early next year.
The defence said that Manning will plead guilty of less serious crime and to fight for the neglect of other charges that were considered too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors who are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning has been imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees to Quantico.
The charges brought against Manning include the theft of property or public documents, collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defence.
If all of the charges are upheld, it shall be subject to the criminal imprisonment for life.

My identity crisis mexico-u.s.
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexican difficult times, he said.
Navarrette said that the Mexico-americans are finding themselves caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico city, arriving in the hall, in front of the services of customs and immigration, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two channels: one for the "Mexicanos ("Mexican"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreign").
I stayed still for several seconds, not knowing to what file to direct me.
I grew up in the centre of California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It is a qualifier ethnic, in the same way as the one that my friends from Boston to use as they say, "irish", or my friends in New York when they say "the italians".
Then, I became the "Mexican-American".
But, here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that has given birth to my grand-father, there is no need qualifier special or hyphen.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to handle an interview in one or the other language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native, and I can't lose my american accent.
So I took my american passport, and I am directed to the file "Foreign".
I thought at that time of the week when the new mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto has paid a visit to President Obama, to the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite themes are immigration, drugs, and commerce.
Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of the mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why the Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risking the United States.
He wants to be allied to the United States and Canada, and create a Union for the trade on the model of the European Union, but also in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans have probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing the half of their territory to the tip of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not of minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as an official U.S. formula for the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way the Americans undermine the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma's looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship, the more difficult is the one that the country maintains with more than 35 million Mexico-Americans who live in the United States.
You want it addresses the topic of bitterness?
There are many of them.
Mexico has its winners and its losers, of persons to which the country offers opportunities and others for which the country do not offer.
The only reason that explains the large number of mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, and San Antonio, is that at a given moment, in our family tree, a person may be a parent or grand-parent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North.
And more often than not, this person was a profile type -- a dark skin, less educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we currently live the american dream, that we went to good schools and that we have a good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the american dream that we live in, and not the one of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the elite mexican among the ruling class does not love us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them a humiliating defeat and they we toisent as if we were individuals of strain lower and not enough mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be gone.
And we do we will not get stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as of the lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is friction between the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, because the Mexican assert more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Americans are upset.
Although she is an american citizen, she has the sense to be part of the two countries.
Furthermore, many of the Mexico-American that I know do not have the impression of being part of a country or the other.
We love the music of the mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we consider us as Americans.
And in the United States, we consider them as Mexicans.
And now, to complicate a little more about the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some leaders in the mexican and a part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexico-U.s. working as ambassadors of fortune for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our fellow americans that Mexico is a beautiful country that is definitely worth a visit and put pressure on the political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, if we consider wage inequality, corruption, and violence related to drugs which are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You'll need to fend for themselves, amigos.
This is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the Member-States of the way they have handled the Mexico there is a century and a half, they must therefore accept that some of the Mexico-U.s. want always to the way in which members of their family have been treated there not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are more "Mexican" than I thought.

The old quarrels, the new Middle East
The cease-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another outpouring of blood seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
While persist the same arguments futile to know who started it, dozens of buildings have been reduced to dust; over 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv-jaffa, city in Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and the Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is changing.
The arab spring has it all shattered, and whether we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are caught up by the regional upheaval.
May be that their struggle will intensify even a little more.
Nevertheless, there are all reasons to think that this could help to get out of this dead-end life-threatening.
A war that is no loser nor winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to demonstrate optimism.
Even if the cease-fire granted on November 21, maintains, the fighting this week have strengthened the supporters of the force, of the two sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the islamist movement which runs the Gaza since 2007, is targueront to have forced the Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has suffered a drubbing.
To have killed some of its leaders and repressed the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the corners to be the most miserable and overcrowded living conditions of the planet, Israel has not managed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground on the west bank, the other part of Palestine is currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah, the other faction palestinian more moderate.
In addition, the leaders of Hamas might say that the time is their ally.
The influence of the islamists in the arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has made friends rich and powerful.
Turkey, a regional power in full swing, formerly the allied muslim closest of Israel, has taken up the cause of the Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the states of the richest and most dynamic of the Course.
The Hamas members were ecstatic and say that the growing Islamist will curve around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia has exercised its domination, passing through Syria, where the rebels to islamist tendency can reverse Bashar al-Assad, and up to the Jordan, where the allies of the Hamas threatens the king.
And the most important, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the muslim brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Israel in Egypt, by far the most populous and the most central of the arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, this despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its collapse in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the muslim brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders rely more easily to the public opinion.
In the diplomatic future, Hamas may emerge as an important global player which cannot be excluded even by Israel and America.
During this time, the supporters of the hard-line Israel will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, the Hamas has been given in the box.
The system of interception of missiles baptized Iron Dome has proved its efficiency and many missiles of Hamas have been destroyed.
The Israelis are going to be able to sleep on their two ears - for a certain period of time.
In terms of diplomacy, America reiterates its unwavering support; and many european countries have accused Hamas of being at the origin of the latest wave of violence.
But most of all, Israel has flourished, particularly under Binyamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been affected by the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier, which encroaches on the west bank, the main piece of what could be a palestinian state, and that protects the jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in the field of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with a party even more hawkish, that of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election on 22 January, the beautiful.
Why pamper those damn palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were in the west bank, will launch't they rockets, as their compatriots have done in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind the wall and hit them as soon as they come out of the head.
It may be that the supporters of the hard-line will prevail; but it may be that the arab spring changes the game.
Even if the islamists come to power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
The defense budget of Israel is more important than the one of its four arab neighbors combined.
Start a war with the superpower local will not help the new arab governments to arrange their economies.
Mr. Govt has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire that bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the arab world that becomes more democratic, to deprive the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit as the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression weakens already democracy in the jewish state, and the demography exacerbates this problem to the extent that the arab population increases.
The missions bloody against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic level.
The two sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains the one promoted by the reasonable persons that are found on each side, and by most of the outside world, and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
A hope, small and in the short term, is that the cease-fire will give the opportunity to persons external to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now strive to put an end to the flow of weapons to Gaza, in the same way that Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders and with exchanges of land and Jerusalem shared.
The Arab countries outside should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a palestinian state that the proposal next pseudo-state of the UN.
Mr. Obama has also any interest in what Israel is willing to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he has not presented its own peace plan.
Back at the White House, it seems just as reluctant to establish one.
It is a vision very narrow.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This happens for a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

The laws for packages of cigarettes neutral entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of diseased organs cover the packages green dark that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colours have been replaced by a green olive dark and horrible pictures of diseased organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by smoking of their parents.
Outside of the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all the packages.
It is the most strict regime in the world in regard to the packaging of tobacco.
The australian federal government has said that the purpose was to discourage young people from smoking in removing any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26 years, there's a 99% chance that they never start.
"Even when they are very young, the children understand the message conveyed by the tobacco manufacturers through their brand image", said the federal minister of health, Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associated crown of a logo to a princess."
Even if Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world, and if these changes had little impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has lobbied against this act.
The tobacco manufacturers have said that this relaunch the trade in black market, which give easy access to cigarettes less expensive.
"Negative consequences will result from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.
The forgers of China and Indonesia will sell more of counterfeit cigarettes in the streets of Australia.
Others have said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd., a small family business, has stated that the application of cigarette cases, including silicone to hide the horrible packaging, has increased greatly in the two months ago since that British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco have challenged the law and lost before the high court of Australia.
Ha said that Iba has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is pending renewal of stock.
For us, business is good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the portion of the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of australian laws prohibiting advertisements on TV, sports sponsorship, and the obligation of dealers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned the advertising on the Web by the companies and the local sites, but it can not prevent foreign sites.
"If you work in the marketing of tobacco and that you do not have more than a small storefront to promote your products, the Internet is the place par excellence," said Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman has noticed an increase in the contributions of some of the citizens lambda in favour of the brands on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask ourselves if it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who gave the money to make a video, or if it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new regulations in force, rather than on the marketing.
The industry went up to pay the Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new decisions of justice - these countries have reported to the WHO that the trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has been significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of the year 2013.
Plibersek said that the government had held discussions with other countries in dealing with similar legislation on the packaging.
Canada was the first country to make obligatory the photos of the warning on the packaging in 2001.
At present, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More severe laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos do not bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and thou ranges package", said Victor El Hage at the time to buy a package which contains a photo of tumour of the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason that will make me stop, this is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult for the storage of packets on the shelves.
"Before, it took me an hour to unload a package, now, it takes me four hours," said Yu.
"The government only had to ban it once and for all and we would have said OK, it is good to be stopped and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.

In a world constantly connected, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of the other plane.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Spend half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention the shops of duty free).
But increasingly, some academics and experts specialized in the development of the child are praising the boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to be bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain paths, interesting, or even feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we know no more of the benefits of boredom.
So should we accommodate the trouble with open arms?
Yes.
And not.
But I will come back.
First, like many people, I thought the fix was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of history in greco-roman at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The trouble goes back very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii include graffiti Latin, which evoke the trouble, they date back to the first century.
Then, there is the definition that we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After traveling many publications and submitted the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, the Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined the boredom as an experience that is "to want to do something, but without being able to engage in an activity satisfactory."
What differentiates the boredom of apathy, he said, is that the person is not going to undertake a task well as she would like.
With apathy, he said, there is not the desire to do something.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, it is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can strongly resemble a depression.
But the Professor Eastwood has said that if the two can be linked, the people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while the depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, when it is in fact a problem of concentration.
In the course of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, the Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have demonstrated experience oldest in which the participants were listening to the tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard, from the room next door, the sound is too high a TV show that had no connection, others have just heard the TV show, and the third group did not at all heard the soundtrack.
Those who have heard the TV to a low sound level have said that they were more annoyed than the other two groups - they have been struggling to concentrate, but did not know why, and have attributed this problem to the concentration of boredom.
When you try to focus on a task that is difficult or involved, a lapse of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a tedious task, "as the look of objects on an assembly line, music can help you not to bother you."
In fact, he said, at present time, we know that when we squirms, or that we scribble, these gestures, often considered to be signs of trouble, are in fact a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wiggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," said the Professor Fenske.
We miss all of one day or the other - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monotone, a film particularly annoying.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "Scale of predisposition to fix" in the 80's.
The scale includes claims such as, "Among the tasks that I do, a lot of them are repetitive and monotonous", and "I have so many interests that I don't have the time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and have need of stimulation many and varied.
But in general, adolescents are quickly bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, has conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 young people and their parents seven to eight times per day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent said get bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of the parents said get bored.
The professor Larson said that he did not know if the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a period where the trouble reached its highest level", particularly because children and adolescents do not have a lot of control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: the trouble is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, this can lead people to take physical risks absurd, make bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as the studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers suggest a link between boredom and creativity, " said the Professor Vodanovich, which is studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The trouble is the way that the brain has found to make you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what the thing is most appropriate to do so.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cooking, it will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not long-term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, it does annoy more, but it will not have learned to deal with it all alone or autorégler, says professor Fenske.
And "this autorèglement passes from one situation to another", he says.
Your child learns not only to entertain, it gets more master of himself in other areas.
I do not think that we should glorify boredom.
Just as I do not believe that we should criticize it.
Feel comfortable outside of boiling constant generated by the activities and the technology is the goal to which we should strive.
The professor Eastwood is in agreement on this point.
"We need to have a bored more often, but the trouble awakens a desire acute and frantic to be connected to something that makes sense", he said.
According to him, what people are searching for, it is a way to disconnect and enjoy the time off.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés", he added, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when the noise stopped."

In Colorado, no directive to the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, student in a university and football player in Colorado, is charged for something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of pellets of marijuana and a pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board of a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border of Kansas, when they were arrested.
After that the police officer has found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that may be used to its consumption - minor offenses, each with a fine of $ 100 - and a court date.
"We are treated like criminals", said Mr. Orozco.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of cases involving a low drug use depends more on the place of the act.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been filed without further action.
The police have ceased to indict adults 21 years of age and more for minor possession of marijuana, because the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors who are in the districts most conservative of Colorado have called to accelerate the business of marijuana existing and continue to charge the people who possess it.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver up to the mountains of the West vote now to prevent the opening of shops selling marijuana licensed by the State in their neighborhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us", said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of the police of Aurora, east of Denver.
The regulatory agencies of the State of Washington is also pose a lot of questions.
They are looking for instructions on how to install a system of permits, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute, and sell it prior to the deadline of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most of the states in the field of regulation on marijuana, first of all regarding the use for therapeutic purposes and now in regard to the personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base, he said.
The Washington law, which is called the I-502, shall take effect on the 6 of December, which leaves a gap in the law of a year, during which the permit system, there will always exist not, then the possession of marijuana will be legal.
During this time, practical issues remain unresolved: how to balance the mandate of the state, which guarantees access to appropriate marijuana authorized and prohibited the installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius of a school, a park, a playground or a crib.
"There will be no places more difficult than the urban areas to install a registered trade-sale of cannabis, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Centre for the legalisation of cannabis, a research group formed recently.
On 21 November, the chief of the police, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney (public prosecutor) do not continue more people 21 years of age and older, who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop to charge people for this kind of offence "with immediate effect."
The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions, which regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney (public Prosecutor), Ken Buck, embodies a vision of a more strict.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to attend to the business of possession of marijuana, mainly in order to put pressure on the users so that they are clean.
At present, 119 persons are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
"Our office has the obligation to institute proceedings against these persons who have committed an offence which, at the time of the facts, was an offence recognized," said Dr. Buck.
The reactions were complicated even in places rural as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the initiative in favor of the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Grand Junction is the largest city in the county, does not appear to adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the public ministry of the county, Pete Hautzinger, has supported this decision, but has also decided not to classify without following all the business of possession of marijuana.
"I don't feel like wasting my time to continue to apply the law until it is changing," he said.
Although 55 percent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and appropriate government to the personal consumption of marijuana is not an easy thing.
And the conflicting reactions that have been observed in different u.s. cities, highlighting the deep ambivalence among local officials in relation to the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people charged with consumption of marijuana and which is expressed as a local spokesman of the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (national Organization for the reform of marijuana laws).
"They have spent a good part of their life to prosecute persons who consumed marijuana, also, they find it difficult to accept that this is legal," he said.
As a first states to deal with the restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as that of alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are set to become a court case for the legalization of drugs.
While the defenders and representatives of the State to provide for a new border sales legalized, they are waiting with concern the guidelines of the federal government, which designs always the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice handed over.
Despite some arrests profile of patients under medical marijuana and sellers, the federal government has allowed the shops on the sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
If it is true that the police is probably not going to push the doors to enter small packets of drugs, it's a safe bet that it opposes the shops approved sale of marijuana for personal use allowed by the new legislation, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities and towns of Colorado have not expected that the federal authorities to act.
Well before the vote, some local administrations have approved moratoria on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even if it is only a one-year deferral.
Last week, the town of Montrose has obtained a moratorium of up to 6 months, and should impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves faced with a problem the federal", said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than to the vote of the State.
Many questions arise.

Petronella Wyatt: I've been battered and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
These are not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always wanted to enter the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother were studied in what, to me, was a prominent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times, which stimulates the two pillars of civilization, the free thinking and tolerance.
Nevertheless, two weeks after I installed in Worcester College at the end of the 80's, to study the history, I decided to make my suitcases, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The newspaper The Evening Standard has claimed that I had left this university, because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the next room to mine.
The author A. N. Wilson said with facétie that I was part after being forced to drink cups and chipped.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled, because I had been the victim of intimidation, and is the subject of constant harassment.
Not because of my name, rather outrageous, nor because of the fact that I had a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason and one reason, and in this cradle of the so-called know, I was the victim of a racist behaviour and barbarian: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was advised a very influential Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this today, you might say.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of students of the centre-right has the same type of persecution.
The hate growing and institutionalized students Tory at Oxford is such that the last week, some of them have demanded a protection of their rights, in the same way as those of gay men, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the hall of the students (JCR) of Corpus Christi College, they declared that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want there to be a representative in the university Committee for equal opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been helped by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two on "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonders: Young, Intelligent, and Right"), devoted to the policy among the students, and which pictured the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-nazis.
We discovered, in particular the student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) ", which moves in a Rolls-Royce, features a full silver and moves with a cane head chrome.
In other universities, students conservatives say be treated as scapegoats of the establishment of the increase in tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice-president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a bias to the left growing in the universities.
People think that we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have met."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student in history at the Corpus Christi, which has proposed a motion for more protection, said that such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, president of the OUCA, said that there has been a deterioration of the attitude of the members of the JCR with regard to the persons who are of the centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of the debates intellectuals, as well as to the well-being of the members," she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I'm entering in September 1986, I was then 18 years of age and a crippling shyness.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted in favour of the refusal to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduction in funding of higher education.
The atmosphere was charged with vibration stalinist.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students were acquainted with each other and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm toward students Tory, but that in addition, they were fun.
It was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, the privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the wood of the classroom.
The first sarcasm that I was the victim was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt," said the professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost a foot.
Pitt, a small man with the face pustular, was impatient easily.
"Is that the Thatchéristes refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned her eyes.
"I suggest you take a French course during your free time - finally, if you are not too busy to make friends", he launched a tone snappy.
I went back in my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I'm sitting all alone then I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
It was a student in the second year of English studies, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said, kindly.
I fear that it should be so.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is taken to target.
It is already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be of Labour (labour).
Later, at the local pub, I loosely tried to hide me.
I insisted on the fact that I didn't agree with everything that was said Mrs Thatcher.
This ploy has failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political science and economics, which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken up the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How the Tories do they love?" asked one of them.
They beat each other, isn't it?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same points of view-only after dark of the night?
Would I have had to become Labour and to deny my opinions?
The three years to come would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only teacher openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was foreign policy advisor of Thatcher and one of the authors of his speech.
He was hardly ever there.
He hated this place provincial and insignificant, and its accession to the point of view of marxist-deterministic of the story.
In 1997, he accepted the post of professor at Bilkent university, Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," me-he said.
I began to shuttle between Oxford and my parents ' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my friends city dwellers more open-minded.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained to him why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies in Oxford, in the forty years, all the political points of view were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world", to me he said pathetically.
They would not do it, not in the city bell towers dreamers.
Even my friends communists had ways blameless.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I am sure that this is to tease you.
This made me break her heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, has succumbed to the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
During a work session will be directed to the following week, when another professor of history has suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Blushing internally shame, I admitted to being a victim of brainwashing of my parents and made of the "old fools".
The respite was short-lived.
It is my father who has impacted the last nail in my coffin oxfordian.
At this time, he wrote two columns in the press Murdoch each week.
My door was locked.
I have been lurking in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers were abandoned.
When they left, I made my suitcase and I took the first train to London.
I have never returned.
You can treat me the wimp crybaby.
But no child of 18 years should not be the victim of such a bullying in the school.
The more tragic is that it was at Oxford, that not only has produced 14 prime ministers Tory, but also has an unwavering reputation of equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino prefer the elegance of the reputation "
In the framework of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture ", opened this week in London, ABC has asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza museum and other clients of the famous Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former home of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the british capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized during the inauguration of the "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a retrospective prestigious which brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his couture house in the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said, with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a history in which the only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the world closed and part of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which is open until 3 march, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, since the princess Salimah Aga Khan up to Lord Snowdon, passing by the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his ascension name: fashion designer modest city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least, they do not override their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet as do some of the stars of pop music", says baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza museum.
In the 60's and 70's, we all lived both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a host of spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We adore all be invited in his chalet in Gstaad," says the ex-wife of the "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of the beauties of the time spent as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of the reputation.
And even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a model Valentino
The model argentina, Valeria Mazza, has not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Square of Spain, Rome, we went to dinner at her apartment.
We were about twenty people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decorations, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest feel important and appreciated," recalls the "top model ", which has started to work with him during the week of Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
" It never goes out of fashion, because her creations are works of art", she concludes.
Parade of lineage of nobility
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions but loves shared.
He loves people, well-behaved with the greatest titles and they love it too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of sixty meters wide, which proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and to scroll to the podium to admire a "public " dream with the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor that he had chosen Jackie Kennedy for his marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool coat and fur that once belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
Among this audience of models, we find names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Sophie of the Habsburgs.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first clothes Valentino are just like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest, "gillette", and a jacket of the collection autumn-winter of 1971-1972.
"It is a gift that he had made me," said Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to all the other to her femininity, her great love of women, and because it's our sublime beauty," adds the former duchess of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and light up the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola Arenberg can more, forget the first time she wore a model Valentino.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her dresses-evening...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, prince Edward Line.
It was an evening dress for the red, with a ruffle, a strapless draped and a low neckline to fall.
"It was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d'arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed by the timeless," says the Italian aristocrat who shares his time between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess d'arenberg retains evening dresses fashion designer with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not just a dress, it is also all the memories that she vehicle".
The "king" of the mode
The grand final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller scope during his marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work, and 25 "ragazze" (the designer calls on her seamstresses) to achieve this silk dress in ivory inlaid pearl, twelve kinds of different laces and a lag of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist, Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the end of the Twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obsessed for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now its best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of The Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has so many honors that any husband of his clients.
"Its refinement, its calm, neat look perfect and I have always jumped to the eye", recognizes Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum d'orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"It was spotless, the years have no effect on him."
If it is a princess who said...

The business of the hardest in the world: the mules human Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the holders of the indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health wearing 70 kilograms of sulphur through the paths of the rock steep.
There are people for whom work is a hell, and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, a 400 minors who earn their living by carrying the sulphur from the volcano Kawah Ijen, to the East of the indonesian island of Java.
He has to work every day until the bottom of the crater, where the gas sulfuric emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with air.
After you have harvested large rocks of sulfur, which weigh a total of almost 70 kilos, it installs in two bamboo baskets for it to load on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 metres to the summit of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the carriers exhausted put more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a pace of a turtle, keeping the balance and measuring their not to stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know that one wrong step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell to his death in the volcano Kawah Ijen several years ago .
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur.
Once at the top, it will spawn a path between the tourists who photograph them as if they were animals in a circus, and bearing trudged the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 miles to the balance that a mining company has installed a little below at 1,850 metres above sea level.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and, we may say, its employees, to which it pays 662 indonesian rupiah (5 euro cents) per kilogram of sulphur.
She then sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in the daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten the sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we gain about 46,000 rupees (3.8 million euros) to each trip", explains Anto, who usually performs three trips per day.
Each takes 3 hours and it ends exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the harvest of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euro per day) and where the average monthly wage is of two million rupees (167 eur), " says the carrier who formerly worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (eur 6.20 euros) per day, and the job was not as difficult, but Anto is back near his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason which, in Indonesia, is also indisputable that the sulphur: "I have married a young girl of Bali, where they are hindus, and I took it back to Java for that she converted to Islam".
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already started to make him pay the bill even though it covers the face with a mask and wearing special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
It is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or to study Spanish or French" promises-t-il in English more than acceptable.
Battered by life, this young, friendly and smart could be a tourist guide, server or a receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, it is the work of a mule.
It shares a hovel of wood contaminated with other carriers, gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not cease to enjoy the night, when its yellow color characteristic becomes blue and shining in the midst of the darkness.
Defying the dark, Anto down into the crater in enlightening with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he has bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers charge baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
In spite of its profits comfortable, the mining company has not mechanized extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to holders who are self-employed and are paid to the weight.
In addition, they do not affect either a sub of 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) to increase by camera, in addition to the input of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euro), that the guards of this natural park to charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for the animals, not humans," said Madrusin, a carrier portly 42-year-old who works at Kawah Ijen since the thirty years since he left the college.
Able to carry up to 110 pounds, it ensures that it will not stop working "as long as it can", because he needs money to raise her 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years of age.
I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur affects the throat and irritate the eyes when the wind turns and trap the minors in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that nobody complains to suffer from serious diseases... which is of course in addition to their usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and shoulders, bent with the weight of baskets.
Balancing a basket on his back, Unainik, aged 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his fellow extract 15 tonnes of sulphur of the volcano, only three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 km away by a trail of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not take my retirement, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik by opening the mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of five children, aged 30 years, also works as a bearer of sulphur.
Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one that make the human mules of the volcano Kawah ljen.

Singapore search babies to save the economy
Singaporeans throw the responsibility of the lack of the child on the career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property.
"The population of Singapore must develop".
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife, and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem implausible that these words come to an advertisement for breath mints, but despite this, or perhaps because of this, the video has spread like wildfire on YouTube to Singapore early this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a bun in the drawer" for mocking the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH, the advertising agency to the origin of the video, hopes to attract attention to the problem of fun way through this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the power of the music for people to "fulfill their national duty".
It is intended solely to the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of the birth rate, and we felt that it was a topic that we are discussing.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launch of perfumes with pheromones or organize evenings of speed-dating.
Many of these ideas are creative but they do not necessarily have worked.
So we said the following: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1,2 children
The government of Singapore does not have as much to the light.
He spends 1,300 U.S. dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriage and fathers grants of up to 15,000 dollars per child, longer maternity leave, and distributes profits tax.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city-state's rich and high technology of South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that it has found above 2, regarded as the rate of renewal, it was in 1976.
So why Singaporeans don't they have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the policy of marriage and the family of the National Division of the Population, says that this is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond the marriage and family formation", she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to delay marriage and births, which results in a decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increase immigration to counter the decrease of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, we find Web sites that abounds xenophobia barely disguised against the new immigrants, especially to the chinese, who are accused of pulling down wages and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which the party in place in Singapore has experienced last year, its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to fix the problem with the establishment of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a country, the income tax, health costs and the immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to prevent the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to touch the real estate sector.
The authorities of urban development have begun to monitor the number of small apartments, known under the name of "shoe-box", which can be built in specified areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters, and their sale has proved very successful.
However, the authorities are worried by the fact that they can promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" are selling much faster than the bigger lodgings.
They are more popular, in the sense that these homes are built much more rapidly than those of larger size.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance to proponents, who was previously a spoke in the wheel if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-State.
If so much is that the new regulations could be a step towards the increase of birth rates national, in discussions with the Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they're not going to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive, just like education, it is for this that the people again later", says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it is important to be able to have my money and my time", we declare another young man of twenty years.
Men and women mention their career, the stress and the cost of the access to the property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, are Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.

This is a private off-line is private online
Privacy
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the field of private life that we can protect it from any intrusion."
That is-this-which falls within the private domain to the under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in the daily life and social networks?
Understand the dangers to which it is exposed in broadcasting on the Internet of events which it does not share certainly not out of line?
The newspaper elPeriódico has questioned five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they have been associated with the term "something very personal" on the personal level and "the password and user name" when they applied to social networks.
"I will not reveal my secrets more personal in a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when it tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he owns an account for the past two years.
"These are secrets, very secret, my mother can know them but not all of the world", he says.
On FB, I post images nice or games.
I also discussed with my friends.
"I will not share any of my pictures or someone who would be the fool", he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish photos obscene, skinned individuals, or crimes write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as its new followers on Twitter.
The majority are of the family.
His mother is a part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to speak and write tweets interesting.
"I don't know if they answer me, I will post them simply", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends, so fast," he said.
He says he would never request from an unknown person.
It will not trust someone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of Jose, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space, and Ask, on the latter, he admits to not knowing 20 of the people listed on his friends list.
"I am not concerned about it because we have something in common, music by example", he says.
According to the young boy, nobody has made advances nor has he asked for her address or telephone number.
"To me they were putting pressure or required by, I'd delete just my account", he admits.
Jose subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that we know today under the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of a friend of mine has been racketté on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to Jose, has not closed his account.
"He has only spent in private profile".
He explains to us then a series of steps to configure his / her account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this young / she posts pictures of knowledge in situations that are uncomfortable or embarrassing.
Yes, I would do if I was angry or upset.
"Even if I know that it is of cyberstalking", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a degree in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and teenagers, one must understand that the purpose of social networking is to inform.
"The Internet has arises as a way to seek information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," said she.
Porras reports that the academician Marc Prensky, who has a master's degree in education from the university of Yale university and author of the book "Natives and digital immigrants", these terms are used to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, these are the children and young people who are born with the technology.
"We, we are the digital immigrants who have to be there to teach them, so that we ourselves are in the process of learning," she says.
He adds that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a criterion set to what it should be or not to disclose, publish, or say, at an age where they do not have the maturity to do so."
"We ask them also to be selective so that what is important to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking of the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach the privacy of children and adolescents is to use questions that make you think.
"Tell them not to do it serves no", she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things that you never would tell it not to a stranger, why do you do on the Internet?
Or, you like it that they publish a picture of you as a friend that you have published?
Do you know what the other post on you?
When you identify pictures of the parties, requests you to other people permission of the invalid?
And also, everyone does it need to know what you are doing in each moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to be online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Out of the Internet, each one must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on the social networks", she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university teacher, primary school teacher and counselor of education, says that it is essential that parents read carefully the terms of use of the social networks.
Including each of the words, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of the opening of an account on the Internet.

The summit of the Unasur is completed without the Lima Declaration is made public
The Life of the presidential summit of the Union of south american nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration has been made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 agents present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed during the Life Ordinary Meeting of the heads of state and government of the Unasur, but the ministry of foreign Affairs and the presidency were reported at the outset that it would be disclosed after the closing of the summit, and then said that it would be released from one moment to another on the Internet site of the peruvian government.
When they were interviewed on the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollante Humala, in the brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit has been limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the assembly's presidential election with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated between the journalists were those given by the press officers of some of the governments of the Unasur, which were present at the appointment, with the exception of the spokesperson of peru.
The unique document disclosed during the day was the list of the presidents present, which has caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important.
Later, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of the president Humala and non-official document that has reached the summit.
Last October, Peru has been the host of the 3rd summit, South American-arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it has been urged by the press, it did not broadcast the statement also called Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, one can verify that the document has been published in the month of march.
In the two international meetings, the peruvian authorities have tried to put in place systems of transmission safe for all journalists, but they are limited to a maximum of obtaining information.
The summit was also concluded with a joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of The Hague, which slice a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at the appointment regional, and have said they would respect the decision of the ICJ to hear the arguments of the two parties in the trial that Lima was filed against Santiago and which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and will carry out the verdict, which will resolve the dispute that we wear today in front of such an international court", said the president Humala, to the side of his chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals", added the president Piñera giving a handshake from the president Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after the British denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua she considered to be seriously flawed.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales and Argentina's Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of his ex-president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, has been charged with opening the deliberations in the morning and the closing of the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative has read the final document in which it announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of the 31 projects had been fixed between the south american countries for a total of 17 million u.s. dollars of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, it was mentioned that the countries of the Unasur put in place of "important steps to achieve the purpose of the citizenship of south-american by the development of agreements on residence permits".
It has informed, that actions will be put in place to improve the "cooperation in the fight against the urban insecurity and against the international organized crime, actions for a better accessibility to medicines, access to the Internet at low prices in the whole of South America, and to assess jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (Latin America) should not have a matrix triomphaliste but should help increase our matrix productive and a glimpse of a better future for our people", the president concluded Humala.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects which enhance the free areas of South America, especially in the rural areas and border... by uniting our countries and in generating new economic circuits," said peruvian president during a speech.
Among these projects, it was noted that five were related to the Peru and stood on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast up in Brazil, and that two were free more important with the Equator although he did not give further details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process of this country will allow its reintegration into the Union of south american Nations", which it is currently excluded.
The need for the Latin America remains a region of peace and prosperity, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another subject discussed at the summit.
In this sense, the colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos said, before the start of the appointment regional, he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico city to calmly discuss the dispute sea through a judgment of the ICJ asked by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with president Daniel Ortega," said the president Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not comprehensive, including the treaty with the Nicaragua which will ask to have a discussion with this country", he stressed.
"I hope to be able to say to the president Ortega that we will resolve this in a most civilized and respectful as possible", added the president Santos.
The presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico city, where they planned to attend the taking of power of the new president of this country, Enrique Rock Nieto.
In the same way, in the framework of the summit, the ministers of Defence of the block will meet prior to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which attempts to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of advocacy in the region.

"South America should learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "the South America, in this case, was to follow the example of Europe".
The president Correa, who has participated in the sixth summit of the Union of south american Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on State-run television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "were killed each other during the Second World War", and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, it has defended the project to establish a citizenship south american encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any south american country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas that reactionaries we want to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the president of ecuador is shown in favour of the reconstruction of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the objective of decreasing the influence of the anglo-saxons and take into account the signatories of the pact of San Jose on the rights of the man.
Those who we rebattent the ears do not compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the south americans, have all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-american Commission on human rights is located in Washington, under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed its principles, but it has otherwise complied with its "deep democratic values and human rights".
It was concluded that at the time, "there were grounds to suspect according to which Assange would be extradited to a third country, and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, it provides a critique of the justice Swedish who demanded that he submits on its territory to an examination in respect of a sexual offence alleged then that "the clean Swedish legislation allows this to be done by video conferencing, which could be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa has said there was a risk that the mental and physical health of Assange deteriorates.
"I have not spoken since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a little problem in the lungs, but nothing serious," said the president of ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is getting worse by the fact of being trapped in a small space without being able to do exercises in the open air.
"This is on the health of anyone," he concluded.
Correa out that the solution of asylum granted to Assange since the month of June in the ecuadorian embassy in London, that would be the assignment of a safe-conduct which would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden, and the european judicial authorities and he points out that there has been some discussion in London in order to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not bargain with the rights of the man, we don't use this word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden, and the european judicial authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Waiter, has launched a series of procedures from different european bodies", he mentioned.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted the safe-conduct from tomorrow, this would come to an end".
And if the Sweden, as did allow its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, interviewed Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London, or the interviewed via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be resolved.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of the freedom of the press, and he made it clear that it is not condoned, not was "the poor, the bad faith and the lies that adversely affect the freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the politicians malicious or perverse but the bad journalists to the balance of greed, blackmail and extortion", he said.
From this angle, it welcomed the fact that this is not that kind of journalists "nor the bankers or the hegemonic countries and bourgeois which dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than put in before his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to continue on the path and draw the right track".
Correa has also supported the decision to maintain a veto on the Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that it "had to be firm and not to tolerate the opportunism and the attempts of coup disguised", because in reality, "it is undermining the legitimacy of democracy in paraguay".
What is more, the president of ecuador considers as "perfectly relevant," the desire of his colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua's maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the international Court of The Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a south american country and a central american countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overwhelmed by the desire to move forward together.
It is necessary to solve in their set to surpass and go forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the correct resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime border between Peru and Chile in the same court and it has warned that "it is beneficial that the Latin America seizes the international bodies if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as to whether farm it to be."
In reference to the possibility of its presentation as a candidate to the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he reported that he saw this possibility, "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa has assured that, if it lost the primary to February 2013, it would withdraw from public life.
At a personal level, the power has never appealed to me, but in situations as unfair as those of the Equator, poverty and socio-economic cannot be resolved only by means of political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me that made this possible victory but we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, this would be my last presidential term and I'll then the political life.
If we ever lose it, I will do it also.
"This is my decision",-he said.
Correa has also made reference to the new medical treatment of the venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, Cuba.
I just talk with the vice-president of venezuela Nicolas Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned, and he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of the state of health of president Chavez", he commented.
The head of State of ecuador has participated today in Lima at the Life summit of heads of State and government of the Union of south american Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to support the progress, equality, and security.

Aids-related deaths are today due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: hiv-positive.
"It is as if the sky had fallen on the head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make it "less heavy", in vain.
The young man had hidden in his family.
He decided to load the only one of his disease, and started reading about it, and his determination has been such that it has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without any doubt, one of the oldest patients of the unity of the HIV hospital civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since 22 years old, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90's, where there were a lot of doubts, with little choice of treatment, and more of stigmata.
Then, even the director of a clinic in the IMSS avoided the need to tell him goodbye "because he was without a voice."
In that time, have aids was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their illness, many people are still coming when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of aids in the world, in all the cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the population in general will be exactly the same," said the head of the unit for HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and takes it for reference that this information has been validated in April of this year in a scientific publication prestigious.
The infectiologue and expert in HIV/aids, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, the scientists concluded that aids was not a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of assignment of the immune system that showed patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not consuming drugs: up to 30 years for a rate of CD4 count of 200 and for up to 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4 cells.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who receive a diagnosis of HIV positive to 25 years, "as long as it remains under control, will be able to live without problems until 75 years old," explained the scientist asked.
In order to place this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the population is now 76 years old, on average.
If it is true that the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people died as a result of aids rose from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of the UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of aids, 60% of patients, identified on the basis of national data are deceased.
Nothing in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 dead until may of this year; however, we are also assured that the access to anti-retroviral medication is universal since 2005.
Then why are there still death?
I think that the problem does not come from access to treatment.
This is the way I see it, this is what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we never ran out of drugs, the problem is that the patients coming to the stadiums very advanced because they do not know they are infected, or so they learn to be in advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive so that they are already an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, it is perform diagnostics earlier and, for this purpose, it is necessary to propose testing a massive scale, and to all persons who ask for it".
The specialists and the members of the State Council of aids prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on its proposal, as the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who has had to give her a screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, in spite of his young age, he was already a carrier of the aids and was suffering from kaposi's Sarcoma, a cancer tumor, which is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have aids.
Some think that they are going to die and do not want to know.
"If I'm going to die, it is better that I broke three times a week," they say, this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he is suffering from cancer.
I have a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but the co-lead, I pay attention to me and to the other person," says Fabrizio, who has agreed to share his intimacy with the MILLENNIUM JALISCO for help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, when walking out of the World Day against aids.
They do the test, if they have taken risks, the more they will know early on if they are hiv-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like all the world, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against aids in this year 2012.
Condoms over the counter
There are many gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of Guadalajara, which has embraced the cause of the HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we gave one or two, now we can offer packages of a hundred, it is all very well, but it follows, that even today, some do not have access to condoms", he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections, we find the teenagers.
The question: "what are you gonna do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by the social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists, and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, ensures the journalist.
It offers to redirect this distribution ineffective; and that condoms are not only sold to the counters, but they're found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places that they frequent the young people.
It does not encourage promiscuity.
It does not pay to them the girls and the motel, as had answered the governor Emilio Gonzalez when he was asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within its administration.
"This is not how it works sexuality, the better is to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active", he stressed.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases cumulative (12,158 aids and 1,317 HIV).
The State is the 4th State of the country in the number of new cases and cases of cumulative aids and 13th for the number of HIV sufferers.
92% of the infections are through sexual transmission, 6% through blood and 2% by perinatally.
It is estimated that 50,000 people living with HIV, since for each case registered, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.

A judgment ratified on appeal by a court of the United States ignores the restructuring of the debt of the group Vitro granted via a bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a previous bad for all the national companies with branches in the neighbouring countries and with solvency problems.
It seems, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of the companies authorized by the laws mexican are not valid in the country in the star-spangled banner, the opposite way of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment rendered on June 15 by the judge Harlin Hale from the bankruptcy Court for the northern district of Texas, leaves mexican companies without defense against the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will enable the leading manufacturer of glass of Mexico to seize the Supreme Court of the United States based on three inconsistencies.
First, then, that the justice of the cause indicates that creditors must register according to the law on the bankruptcy of the United States, the court of appeals for the fifth circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the bankruptcy commercial formalized in Mexico.
The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in the event of the insolvency of companies with a profile transnational.
In fact, the Model law of the United Nations for Uniformity of the Law of International Trade had been created to this end, taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
In the second place, the judgment establishes that, without the vote inter-company, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debt owed by subsidiaries of Vitro against the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not be obtained.
However, the laws mexican recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here there is a half-dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including the Federal Institute of Bankruptcy Business had guarantees of the debts.
In addition, what is certain is that, as he left the votes of subsidiaries, of all the ways in which the creditors of Vitro, which fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is to say, the fund "vulture" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes against 37.
A given omitted by the court of appeal.
From another side, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without stopping to the serious economic crisis that confronted the United States, resulting costs to the country.
For the moment, the company of the family Gonzalez Sada interjettera appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is to say with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The use of insurance will claim the non-prosperity and requires the revision of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico in the name of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which was detailed the procedure followed by Vitro in the framework of the bankruptcy law, business, pointing out that this was the conventions signed by the two countries for the set at the same level as the paragraph 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
In addition, it indicates that the country is folded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is to say, the rules laid down for cases of cross-border insolvency, which ensure equity for the debtors and the creditors.
Pile-up of two parts: they are stunning Vitro and they are stunning the country.
General balance

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "basketball is my life"
The globe-trotting basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relationship with the terrain and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as big as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorrhage condemned to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, either as a player from the lower leagues, a player of the national team of basketball, manager, and leader of the national team, the NSO, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as the president of the federation of basketball.
"I have worn many hats in the basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the NSO, director general of the national team and president of the Russian federation during the 90's," recalls Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora home to Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my life."
Reyes am not exaggerating when he made this assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all of them decorated with the photos and the memories that remind us of its route out standards, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most, are those who reminds him of his stint as a player in the team of the Vaqueros in the middle of the 50s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as a co-manager or team manager.
"This has been my best year, those of which I have benefited the most because I had the chance to participate in eight championships Vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
This is a lot of years of satisfaction, including five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then removed during the championship in 1981, the year in which Jerome Mincy is entered in the team of the NSO.
From there, "the Cuckoo" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, has taken the helm of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: " I have a player's tough for you, it measures two metres.
You want it ?"
It's like this and start Mincy, one of the best players that have been Puerto Rico.
Bartow I was then recommended Raymond makes fun, who has been naturalized and that was one of the best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, makes fun was going to help us to try to win another.
It is forward of the championship of the Vaqueros with makes fun, but only at a distance, as in 1988, he was already the grand manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of its charges and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the United States during the tournament, pre-olympic Mexico in 1989.
Then, there was the 1990 World, where we arrived 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if this canadian judge was not made to replay the last game, " said Reyes.
The team of the 1990 World is it the best national team that you've seen ?
It is part of the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the Olympic Games in 2004.
But my favourite is the one of the Pan-american Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and that we have put a beating to the team of the United States, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze medal at the World.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, makes fun, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world from 90 to cause a problem knees.
A team that was, perhaps, not the best in terms of individuals, but it has given us a gold medal and a great joy at the tournament pre-olympic Neuquen, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended for the imbroglio of the Pan american Games in Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all the forecasts.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it is Piculín Ortiz.
Its level statistics of international tournaments are impressive.
Person in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as it was done Piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in the different leagues for which he has played.
That was the best leader puerto rican?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the young, very much I love the work that made Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been a part of the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of the 1990s, the NSO had until 17 teams in a season.
That you are there to do?
There are things that I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only confront teams from other areas of the island at the time of the play-offs national.
Today, young people traveling and playing too much so that it is not necessarily needed.
I have at least seen the benefit of the mandatory certifications and courses for the leaders, the field staff and the arbitrators.
This makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I look at clips of my time on YouTube, I'm taking advantage of my grandchildren and, from time to time, I attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been at my side.

Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night from complications of cancer, according to a press release of the family sent to The associated Press for the Warner Bros., house of production of the "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the role ironic that he loved the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his close friends were with him in Dallas in this holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series, and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital of Dallas, said his press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
It was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and it goes much I miss.
"It was an exceptional individual, and he lived life to the fullest," said Gray in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver to Larry Hagman in 1992 and it was found to have been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he had detected a malignant tumor in the liver, and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before, "Dallas", Hagman was made known to the tv in the role of an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by the channel NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a genius attractive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he brought back with him.
He also played in two comedies, which remained some time on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among her film roles include roles well received by critics in "The group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed its greatest success.
The dramatic series of CBS on the clan Ewing and their relatives has been broadcast in April 1978 to may 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, has generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in paris.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record of the hearing at this time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen, and have made of the "Dallas" the second program of entertainment the most watched in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, who had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law J.R., Kristin (performed by Mary Crosby) who fired at him.
J.R. was pregnant and had then threatened to accuse him of prostitution if she does not leave the city, but other people had also reasons of the attack.
Hagman has played the role of Ewing as a corrupt man and insatiable but the charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and a cheating husband who was trying to make interner his wife alcoholic Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would be like epitaph for J.R", said Hagman in 1988.
We should write: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
Here's the only part that he has lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste of the original series, is remembered on Friday to Hagman as a man " immense, both on the small screen than in the life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know him and to love.
Ten episodes of the new edition of the "Dallas" were released a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
The registration of the five episodes is already completed for the second season, and a sixth is in progress, has informed the chain.
For the moment, neither the Warner nor the channel TNT did release on the manner in which will be integrated into the death of Hagman in the series.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of singer and actress Mary Martin, who had been in the celebrity with the classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave him the day in 1931 while she was married to the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on scenes of theatres of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It is there that he met the young an interior decorator Swedish Shift Axelsson and that he was married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and has lived many years in the california town of Malibu, where a resident of many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': The memoirs of ruthless J.R)
"I haven't written anything in this book that can hurt someone or affect in any manner whatsoever", he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active militant of the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer at a hospital to attend to the patients concerned.
"I highly recommend them, I gave them confidence, I come up with them when they come to be operated on and after", raconte-t-il in 1996.

A course dealing with the "End of the world" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and climate change.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmed has decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing away a hook irresistible: the end of the "great body count" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, referred to by many people as being the evidence of the end of the world is imminent.
But the professor Charmed had no idea what was waiting for him in the course of the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a pit tax that some have dubbed the "Armageddon" debt and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the theorists christians of the end of the time thought that would trigger the apocalypse.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the half of the more apocalyptic than I have ever known", said this week the professor Charmed its students from Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today, as if we were 30 days later and that we provided, this has been a very good time.
And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the revelation.
And it is not the only teacher to give lectures on "the end of the world" this semester, which will be, in theory, the last of the story.
At the Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker exemption the course "Media, culture and end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and climate change.
"We analyze this, because these ideas are proliferating with the time," he said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical scenarios guide a certain human conduct.
If the nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students will analyze movies with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, the professor of the History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to deliver a lecture, entitled simply "the end of The world".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in the case when the world would disappear not," said the professor Restall.
In spite of the "impending disaster", students have to study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the State of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be spent on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not allow the student to other choice than to work "until the night of the end of the world supposed to," said Restall.
The courses have proved to be quite popular.
"It was full two hours," said Restall about its course is intended for students of high level, consisting of 35 students.
We have received email messages for several weeks before the beginning of the semester, the share of people who were asking if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and the sociology of 23-year-old native of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers University-Camden.
Because the fear of the book of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a Psychology student and Infirmary of 25 years, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this matter",-he said.
I really appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, and even less a teacher, not told us to believe in the date of the end of the world from 21 December.
"Our first project was the mayan prophecy, and in some way we have discredited," says Julie zegle, a student of last year to the Temple, 21 years old and a native of West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to the book of revelation in the western culture, dating back several centuries, which fact that people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"In other places of the globe, people do not think of that," he says.
The majority of the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of The Room that gives courses in the Philippines this year, has responded quickly when we asked him if he knew that was given here of the course on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", we-he answered, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years, we talked about many dates expected of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "the people will immediately start to think about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that on the 21st of December marks the beginning of a period of 7 years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to the light.
Several have told us that they thought they were going to holidays "to the end of the world".
"Sometimes I call friends and we get a good laugh together," said Samira Ford, a student in communications of 20 years.
