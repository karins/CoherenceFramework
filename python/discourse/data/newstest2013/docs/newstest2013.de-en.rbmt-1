A republican strategy, in order to advance toward the re-election of Obama
The executive personnel of the republicans justifies their politics with the necessity to fight the electoral fraud.
However Brennan Center the latter holds for a myth, by affirming that the electoral fraud is rarer in the USA than the number of humans killed by the thunderbolt.
The attorneys of the republicans by the way registered only 300 cases of electoral fraud in 10 years in the USA.
One are safe: these new regulations will affect the election turnout negatively.
In this sense these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.
Contrary to Canada the US Federal States are responsible for the execution of the elections in the individual states.
In this sense the majority of the American governments announced new laws, which make the procedure more difficult for the registration or the going to the polls since 2009.
This phenomenon won after the elections from November 2010 at meaning, with which 675 new republican representatives in 26 states could be registered.
Consequently 180 bills were introduced alone in the year 2011, which limit the practice of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require that the voters submit a photo document of identification and a proof of the U.S. state citizenry.
Beyond that by these laws the periods for the premature casting of votes are likewise shortened, which rescind right to register itself at the election day as voters and citizens the right to vote agreed upon, for whom a court record is present.
Before the elections of 2006 no U.S. state required of the voters to present a photo document of identification.
Indiana was the first Federal State, which raised a such demand.
The highest Gerichtshof of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana in the year 2008.
The republican authorities hurried to expand this practice since other states.
In the course of the last two years they promoted bills to 34 Federal States, with which the voters are forced to present a photo document of identification.
It is important to mark that the US-citizens do not order contrary to Quebec over a universal badge like the health insurance map.
Indeed 11% the US-citizen, i.e. 21 million do not possess persons entitled to vote of a government authority of their state an issued photo document of identification.
Beyond that do not have five million new voter in the year 2012 a such document of identification.
However frequently more than hundreds dollar are to be paid, in order to receive the necessary document of identification.
By the new restrictions are disproportionately strongly concerned recent humans, minorities and humans with low income.
Indeed 25% the Afro American, 15% of the persons with an income of less than $35,000, 18% the citizen 65 years and 20% the voter do not have between 18 and 29 years over the necessary photo document of identification.
This still passes on.
The students, who are not regarded as voters, who deliver their voting increased for democratic candidates, are it in several states permitted to use their photo document of identification issued of their facility.
On the other hand the same states permit it to members of fishing rod or hunt associations, which selects more strongly for the republican side, to use the maps issued by these associations for elections.
2004 ago no Federal State demanded a proof of the nationality for selecting.
Arizona was the first Federal State, which introduced a such demand.
Since have a dozen states of laws discharged 2011, which demand from the voters that they prove their U.S. state citizenry.
These measures aim clearly off to limit the Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two of three Hispanic voters, who prefer a democratic party.
Beyond that republican legislators promoted 2011 to eight Federal States of laws, with which the registration was abolished by voters at the election day.
Beyond that you limited the right of individuals and groups to carry out for those voters assistance which would like themselves to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example the campaigns contributed to the voter registration with the general elections 2004 to register approx. 10 millions citizens.
Because by the measures adopted since 2009 the portion of the registration of new voters was reduced 2010 compared with 2006 by 17%.
In addition the republican legislators in five further Federal States adopted laws, which aim at, to shorten the period for the premature casting of votes.
For example were with the general elections 2008 in Florida 33% the voter, which selected in advance, Afro Americans, although they constitute only 13% the voter of the Federal State.
Same is valid for the Hispanic population.
The latter constituted only 11% the voter, but 24% the citizen, who selected in advance.
In contrast to it the white ones, which to 76% the voter represented, made only for 46% the voter out, who selected in advance.
Naturally the democratic legislators and their supporters against-placed themselves energetically to the adoption of laws, which limit the registration of the voters.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of the democratic governors.
The general attorney of the USA intervened, in order to suspend the most disputed laws.
They could partly limit the damage.
For example only 16 of the 34 Federal States adopted laws, which require a presenting of a photo document of identification.
However the again introduced rules will certainly make the practice more difficult of the right to vote in the year 2012.
The democratic critics prangern the party-political nature of the adopted laws on and see the influence of the results in the states decisive for 2012 in them as a clear goal.
A report of the Brennan Centers of 2011 shows that those states, which adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 voices, which are necessary in the elector committee, in order to win the presidency.
It is too early, in order to confirm with certainty that these changes of the legislation at the choice system will have significant effects on the result of the presidential elections in the year 2012.
But one are safe: these new regulations will affect the election turnout negatively.
In this sense these measures partly undermine the democratic system of the USA.

Prostate gland cancer early recognition: should the test be made or not?
The PSA test wise indeed sometimes incorrect results up, with wrong negative or in addition, wrong positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interferences.
This leads to stronger hesitating of the already undetermined men for the execution of early recognition tests.
Should the test be made or not?
We caught up the opinion of two specialists.
Existed with the studies accomplished in the USA numerous interference factors between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that a difference exists with the number of deaths of patients with and without early recognition.
This study likewise showed that with a Nachbeobachtung after 12 years the probability of the formation of metastases is higher around 30 to 40%, if no early recognition were accomplished.
Therefore I recommend the test starting from an age of 50 years and/or 40 years, if one has direct relatives, which was gotten sick with prostate gland cancer already.
With men afro American origin exists likewise a higher risk.
The most important is to make the correct decision as soon as a cancer condition was recognized.
There are kinds of cancer, which aggressively and others, which are indolent.
For the patient the extent of the risk of its cancer condition must be really understandably made, as the possible options are pointed out to it, with which prostate gland cancers remain untreated can, if it does not impair the quality of life in the long run, and one decides in these cases rather for an active monitoring of the illness.
Today no treatment takes place at many men, with whom one recognized cancer, since its cancer is not aggressive and represents no threat for their life.
One proposes an active monitoring and offers to them when progressing the illness a treatment.
One determines the criteria with increasing accuracy for a decision, who should be treated and who not.
Therefore I recommend nevertheless the execution of the test.
Most importantly it is however to speak with its physician in order to determine whether it should be accomplished or not.
In co-operation with the international society for urology Movember developed an instrument, with which it is possible to evaluate the pro and cons of the PSA test.
This document (only on English, but a translation soon at present will be available) can be downloaded under the following address: http://ca.movember.com/fr/mens-health/prostate-cancer-screening
Prevent the illness
Unfortunately there is no miracle drug for the prevention of cancer.
Despite the progress in the research the acceptance of a healthy way of life remains the best way, in order to reduce the risk to get sick with it.
It becomes estimated that 30% of the cancer conditions could be prevented, if all would move well to eat and sufficiently.
“If there no more smokers would be the Canadian cancer company, this value to 50% to rise at least”, stresses André Beaulieu, Sprecher.
However is assumed about 10% of the cancer conditions are caused by inheritance.
Several remain also completely unsettled.
For the Canadian cancer company the fight against tobacco dependence a priority, despite the decrease of the number of the smokers remains.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of cancer of the lungs.
It is also a factor of risk for several other kinds of cancer.
It damages strongly the health of humans.
“Today there are still 1.5 millions smokers” in Quebec, regret the spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: , The risk at cancer is reduced 10 years after the renouncement of the cigarette to die by half.
The weight
In accordance with the Canadian cancer company predominance and adiposity promote likewise the outbreak of the illness.
They seem the risk for breast, Grimmdarm, mast intestine, esophagus, to increase pancreas and uterus cancer.
“The research shows that a regular physical activity protects, adds during the entire life from Grimmdarmkrebs” it.
The nutrition
The organization recommends likewise to limit the consumption from red meat to.
In too large quantity it increases the risk to get sick with a Grimm and/or a mast colon cancer.
Sausage goods should be avoided likewise.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic agents.
The “latters can damage and to the development of cancer lead the somatic cells”, explain it.
Vitamins
In the last years several scientists examined the connection between vitamin additives and cancer.
Their investigations are not however at present conclusive.
After the Canadian cancer company the studies are contradictory to vitamin E.
While a study found the decrease out of the risk of prostate gland cancer, another showed rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on the cancer was not pointed out clearly likewise yet.
Beyond that Mr. Beaulieu stresses, as important it is to speak with its physician about its doubts and its family preloading.
“The execution an early recognition test does not lead to cancer.”

The Higgs boson analyzes
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson excited certain attention in the last summer, and this for good reason.
One believes indeed that this boson is less than involved in the mechanism to nothing, which is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally it concerns the last particle, whose existence was forecast by the standard model - our best or “to few wrong” explanation of nature and the behavior of the subject -, but was not observed empirically yet.
But for the physicists it is not yet completely sure that it really concerns the Higgs.
We know without the shade of a doubt that we have a genuine new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs boson forecast by the standard model strongly.
Beyond that this seems to be confirmed by new data, which were presented this week on a large congress of physics in Kyoto, but still data are missing, in order to be perfectly safe over it.
We assume nevertheless it actually concerns the Higgs, since apparently only a small risk exists to be mistaken and looks at we us, which it concerns.
There is an inevitably inevitable law, which causes in this world that two objects can be not at the same time present at the same place.
It is not possible to offend against this rule - and tries you it not too strongly, since you will hurt yourselves.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that for it a such law is likewise valid: the Pauli' exclusion principle, which means that two particles cannot occupy same area at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state”, whereby this “condition” consists on the whole of some their characteristics.
Outgoing of it the physicists divide the particles in two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens, who are called fermion and well-behaved the pauli principle to obey.
And in the other one move the bosons, a bad gang of anarchists, which nothing holy actual in any case not this principle, which means that they can be indeed at the same time at the same place.
These bosons subdivide themselves in accordance with the web page The Particle Adventure of Berkeley Laboren (those is absolutely amazing by the way) in two groups: the Mesonen, which we will not treat here and which “strength particles”, by which the large forces of nature spread and would be somehow related to those the Higgs boson.
It must be stressed here however that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures, as one could mean.
If you are able to read this chronicle then only owing to a boson of unusual banality: the photon or the “light particle”, which is the “messenger” of the electromagnetic strength.
If a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field “is disturbed” exactly at this place, in approximately like a pebble, which was thrown into a pond.
From this “disturbance” an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation etc.) results, and this wave is nothing else as a photon and thus a one of the bosons “carriers of the strength”.
More stable field
Same is valid for the Higgs boson, with which difference that another field, which must become “disturbed” Higgs field, so that this boson shows up.
However the Higgs field is very many more stable than the electromagnetic field; the exciter must achieve very high energies, a little comparably with a frozen pond, whose surface could be zerfurcht only by a very large rock.
Therefore an enormous particle accelerator is necessary like the CERN - the Large hadron Collider is a ring with an extent of 27 km! - to reach around such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful, in order to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
There is indeed not all particles and not all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but for example a sheet paper would never hold other non automatically at the refrigerator.
And equally not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those, which do it, possess a mass, while other (like by the way the photon) possess no mass.
For what all these research can be “good” now, asks Mrs. Plamondon?
For the science they serve the examination of the standard model (SM), and it make possible for the physicists likewise to exactly examine all deviations between the observations and the forecasts of the SM.
There are by the way numerous physicists, who hope keenest the fact that such deviations are found since the smallest difference to a “new physics” opens a door and could some holes of the model plug.
One must say that the latter exhibits still large lack, since it does not offer an explanation for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter, which form approx. 80% of the subject of the universe (again ups!).
However with the CERN such deviations were not found up to now.
Effects
The effects of these research for the population of general are more difficult to predict, but it would be to be accepted wrongly that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 60's the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not assume that their work would cause a such revolution.
They continued to see scientific applications nothing else, but.
Indeed us the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked into the Bell lab, has in whom the laser into the 1960er years was invented, and which developed 1962 even the first continuous beam laser (first were pulsed) - already said that the laser was regarded at the beginning rather as a “laboratory plaything”.
Place yourselves forwards…
In addition applications can result also from all the instruments, which surround the research.
For example again Willard Boyle developed 1969 during his work in the optics a small photosensor.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor serves today all digital cameras world-wide as “eye” and for it 2009 the Nobel Prize for physics brought in.
Naturally this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will change inevitably our life, but it means that one can really never know it…

Palliative care - the best way to die… | Le Devoir
With its committee for “dying in” Quebec discussed recently the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be taken up shortly again, although a bill is prepared.
However still much remains doing in this important subject area.
Le Devoir tried to regard this more near.
A few weeks ago Mr. L lived. still alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate gland cancer, which consumed him, had it one eke out from two years left.
“You gave me five years to live, I seven years created”, said it halfheartedly, lying in its bed in the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois in Beloeil, in which it had the day before arrived.
“However it is always a shock, whereupon one can be preparatory”, says he.
The illness makes its work: immeasurable weakness prevents it to go and even even eat however on the toilet.
At the table before a delicious lunch sitting, consents he resigns to be able to be helped when eating.
Courageously succeeds even smiling it and speak with the strangers, which are busy around him, it its medicines brings, and a bath to him offer.
The courage of usual death.
“My largest desire is it that one means diarrhea heals, there this is humiliating”, communicates it.
A few hours later the team found an elixir for this evil.
“In the course of our life we experience that a man in standing pees, tells” Pierre Brodeur, Psychologe in the home Victor Gadbois.
To the childhood phase to return an unacceptable humiliating is for certain persons.
“He hangs a backward step of the ability of the person”, adds off, determines.
Because in opinion of several persons, who work in the palliative care, large events take place in the midst of these backward steps.
The patients, who are instructed into the home for palliative care Victor Gadbois, suffer all from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In this stage they are over-accumulated by the physicians and nurses, who worry about them, no more with so-called “healing” care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years, is the worst fear to die “consciously and by asphyxiation”.
But by the illness has I mean children really to know learned.
“I have good children”, add her.
“I have no more desires in the life”, say her, before she accepts that one puts it on a mask, which helps her when breathing.
It expects last visit of its son, who comes from Italy in the next days nevertheless still another.
In the home one offers Victor Gadbois with a group of volunteers hygiene and assistance with food intake.
The palliative care is used if there are no more other possibilities.
In order to arrange a dying more pleasant.
Into Quebec a bed comes for the palliative care on 11.700 inhabitants.
That is very few, if one considers that we will die one day everything.
Here the life under optimum conditions is continued, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the lady doctors of the home.
Both on level of the physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants depending upon desire a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi to the dying.
The diabetics do not have to control their blood sugar level any longer.
And death is part of the everyday life.
Last night we served to Mr. X a beer, which died in the course of the night.
This morning its son will drink up the beer to feet of the deceased.
“We help members and patients equally”, report care directress Nathalie Savard.
In the home Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other one.
Beside an old man of 93 years, who enjoys and well by its pillows is supported the last one family meeting in the yard, while one knocks against in its honours, dies a young man of 36 years, who is surrounded by its parents, its wife and its two small children, on tragic way, after he tried everything, in order to survive.
“For six months are three to five beds always with cancer patients in the age by less than 45 years occupied”, communicate Dr. Christiane Martel concerned.
53% of the patients instructed in the home Victor Gadbois come from its dwelling, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of the entrance to the palliative care
One says the fact that 77% the Canadian do not have an entrance to the palliative care, i.e. to a care, which is to alleviate the suffering of patients, if achieved the latter final stage of its life, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, like the home Victor Gadbois and the society for domestic palliative care in the region Montreal more or less exclusively specialize in the care of cancer patients.
Exactly this large inadequacy in the health care Quebecs ensures for the fact that several expect in the palliative care specialized physicians of the adoption of a law to the regulation of euthanasia and assisted suicide with doubts.
For the month October is a manifest in the circulation, which was signed by prominent personalities of the palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in order to state their contradiction to a such initiative.
Dr. according to Christiane Martel is not efficient the health system Quebecs enough, in order to guarantee that are all right to a qualitatively high-quality palliative care, before one accepts, to change over to the euthanasia.
Recently, it says, I a female patient saw, who was 14 days with large pain in provisional accommodation, without one seized measures to its alleviation.
I fear that the patients want to die only, because they do not receive appropriate health care.
And at the same time several oncologists treat their patients despite worst prognoses becamed deeply absorbed up to the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal, when them broke a cumbersome chemotherapy off.
When I communicated my oncologist the fact that I will break the treatment off her me answered that she regrets that I give the fight up, told it.
However she had said to me that I in the end was!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients asked, to die, the maintenance personnel to thank that it did not allow this desire, after her pain was alleviated by a team of the palliative care.
It must be said however clearly that the palliative care is not during the pain treatment omnipotently.
After Elsie Monereau, 8% of the patients address Leiterin of the palliative care of the society of the domestic palliative care of the region Montreal not on a pain treatment.
Completely in the end the life the physicians fall back thus frequently to the terminal sedation, which runs out the patients either sporadically or permanently up to the time of its death.
We cannot do longer in such a way, as if we do not notice this side of the suffering.
Patients without pain relief will have ever more frequently the possibility of falling back to this terminal sedation.
Patients, whose pain is not alleviated, say all the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But that means inevitably, “I do not want that you put me to sleep”, but “I would like that my pain is alleviated”.
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian institutes for health research.

Real estate scandals of large extent to Quebec
Officials of the highways department, enterprises of the main construction trade, financiers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell to each day, which they know about a great “system”, in which building industry, an official, politician, trade unionist and mafioso are involved.
A “industry”, which was very expensive for the taxpayer Quebecs, in particular in the 1990er and 2000er years.
“It is strangely, how the system disintegrates, since then one drastic measures seized”, jokes Jacques Duchesneau, Abgeordneter in Quebec and former director/conductor of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was uncovered by it due to a detailed investigation of the defraudations in connection with the contracts to road repairs in Quebec, which the prime minister at that time had only unwillingly agreed.
The “Duchesneau report” established a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in the year 2010”, he stresses, “alone the Ministry of Transport a billion dollar at the contracts would have saved”, because curbed some its instinct in order to receive its portion!
The Charbonneau commission “brought, adds already two mayors to case” it to point in hope that she succeeds, “tactics out behind the individuals”.
A 2011, a permanent anti-corruption unit brought into being
The 2011 in the life called, permanent anti-corruption unit undertake great efforts with its troops at chartered accoutants, determining and analyst of the government likewise.
In addition the policemen of the “Marteau troop”, which caused since 2009 that the “drains trust” proceeds from Montreal with the artificial blister of the contracts more reservedly…
In the last weeks it made by the dozen house searches and raised accusations because of fraud and corruption against local political representatives such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who are a mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who straight of its office as a mayor von Laval, who withdrew third biggest city Quebecs.
It is suspected, in the exchange for public contracts repeats bribes to have received.
Expressly by the way engineers of the highways department of Montreal, as well as entrepreneurs were accused of Italian origin, like Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter excited attention, by explaining the function mode of the “system” to the commission for the receipt of public contracts.
It paid several years long to 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to a mediator standing with the mafia in connection, who transferred the money to the union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito had his hand in the play into the 2000er years everywhere, by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollar (approx. 68,000 euros) at province parties, particularly to the liberals whom were at that time in power.
It confessed likewise an illegal raising of funds for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau to have organized.
Drains contracts, whose costs were artificially blown up by it
In Montreal the “system” functioned to the corruption smoothly.
The former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the commission: in ten years it received bribes at a value of 736,000 dollar from the building contractor of gifts, invitations to journeys, gulf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey plays, as well as as return for drains contracts, whose costs he blew up artificially.
Other officials of the highways department admitted that they let themselves lubricate, by blowing up the bills with wrong auxiliary services artificially around 30-40%.
In addition an organizer of the party of the mayor, of Martin Dumont, accused Mr. of Tremblay that he ignored intentional over a shade budget, which filled its cashes with black money.
Due to these exposures Mr. Tremblay at the beginning of withdrew November, which fell Montreal into a heavy crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one the first delegates of Montreal, the alarm struck.
When mayoress of the urban district Rivière the Prairies, in the east of the island, revolted it itself starting from 2010 against the sale of a community property that for 5 million dollar one acquired and one resold for 1.6 million at builders in booming the property market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
Of the investigation, which is finally accomplished, she says that she pulls “on a thread, which it made possible to understand the function mode of the system infiltrated by ants around the evil to stop and the guilty ones denounce”.
She says that the procedure is positive “painfully, but”.
We are about to clean the wound needed however only a determination unit, as well as a supervision, intended for Montreal, in order to prevent a return of the doubtful practices.
As one makes clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau marks for his part that “officials stole, make themselves from thoughts several hundred million dollar” however above all over the role of the “political representatives, who are over tactics in the picture”, if they were not complicated into the fraud!
On the basis of a portion of 70% black money with the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec it jokes: “It was said to me that this was only a weak poor copy of the reality.”
The government Quebecs suggests limiting the donations at parties to 100 dollar which would change according to it nothing in the situation: “The campaign expenses to be not strictly limited so long, black money will be in the policy in the circulation.”
It recommends a complete revision of the system for the assignment of public contracts and the financing of the parties: “We cannot fall more deeply; by going to the things with courage on the reason, we can develop the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws again.”
If this history damages the international reputation Quebecs and that one of Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau requests those, which laugh to throw a view into their own backyard…

“PSG is not the FC Barcelona!”
In this season you accepted a new extent with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it by a personal insight, in addition, by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players came.
I make progress daily at its side.
The technical personnel gave me likewise much.
These elements would stimulus me daily to improve my play level.
And with a play is still simpler this.
In the football everything goes very fast.
But I do not break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparing training of the INF Clairefontaine up to my play time with Saint Etienne I made always gradual progress.
They make themselves thus the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti…
The new acquisitions of this summer are accustomed to deliver plays very high levels.
They know also that each training unit is decisive.
This leads to the fact that a player must to be offered as I, the forehead and its best wants to give.
By the way Carlo Ancelotti gives me much regarding my playing position.
It is supported by co-trainers such as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the correct person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti flößt all technicians respect.
In the Ligue 1 there is no comparable person at present, and he ranks among the best coaches of Europe.
It looks on a rich experience back and many titles with respected associations won.
It had contact with large players.
I think that he will win into of Paris further titles.
In January I held an encouraging conversation with him.
At that time I had recovered straight from an injury series.
The confidence, which it set into me, is likewise an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season of the PSG?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took the place of the front runner to us.
We lie in wait however in the ambush.
One of our most important goals is the champions League: we qualified ourselves in this way for the round of the last sixteen.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on everything is possible.
However we will have our Wörtchen put in a word against very good European crews.
First we want to become first of our group before postage, so that we can deliver the replay of the eighth final as home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
It has already the budget for it…
In order to become a large European association, must of Paris title win and a name on a long-term basis make itself.
This is today not the case.
Financially the PSG gives itself the means, so that this project takes concrete forms.
Would it be a large failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1 how this was in the last season the case?
This would be natural a large disappointment.
This year is it to us really because of the heart to cream off this title.
In the last season we were close to.
In May we were disappointed, since we were strong enough, in order to carry the victory off.
We terminated the season with a very strong achievement.
We locked with 79 points.
Normally one should be with 79 points masters…
But another crew, that one of Montpellier, obtained a still better season.
I believe that this year is the correct.
Even if the large crews struggle such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux for the title, I believe that we have things to win him.
Do you think that the media expect too much of the PSG?
Considering its that and which is players, whom we have, it normally that much of us is expected.
We accept that perfectly.
If we win however with a home game against Troyes 4-0, and one still finds something, what one can accuse us, with security the something is frustrating.
One asks oneself, what the people still expect.
We could never win each weekend with 4-0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to set up a play concept.
A crew develops itself with the time.
In the champions League we proved strength.
Regard Manchester town center, an association since two of the seasons do not create yourselves, qualify for the round of the last sixteen too, and which transacted likewise enormous expenditures!
Regarding the invested sums one believed you to the play break with 15 points lead!
That would mean that our opponents and the French championship was neglected.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good in the last season, “were geboostet” by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue is exciting 1.
I hope that we will be in the month May the smiling winner and us to say that we finally won it despite all difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely on the achievements on Zlatan Ibrahimovic dependent.
All the better that one speaks of a “Zlatan dependence”.
That is, that Ibrahimovic is high performance and many gates shoots.
Therefore he came and he proves that he is the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere, where he played, it led before eyes that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the crew we respect both the player and the person.
He respects likewise the persons, who surround him.
Which it carried out, is really unusual.
This spurs the others to improve their play level.
Thiago Silva, who is world-wide one of the best defenders, makes it for all different possible likewise to make progress.
How did you experience the European championships 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was to me because of the heart to participate in this European championship.
Unfortunately my injury prevented me to drive something play time out.
I saw there things, from which I came out strengthened.
Today I succeed in realising good plays in the national team.
This was since my baptism with the “Bleus” my hope.
From what occurred in Ukraine, we drew our teachings, and today we must put an exemplary behavior to the day.
Which opinion do you have to the first months of Didier Deschamps at the point of the “Bleus”?
It achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the WM.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and stimulates to the victory.
As it was also Laurent Blanc.
But I would not like to employ a comparison.
Blanc had achieved its goal, by having qualified us for the European championships.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the “Bleus” to Brazil.
On 16 October the standoff forced in Spain (1 places: 1) a prelude play?
This play gave us confidence.
Everyone used itself for all different.
Before this meeting in Spain I did not experience ever a comparable play in my career.

With Bitcoin paying and selling without bank are possible
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and handling charges between the involved ones.
Beyond that is like so often in these technologies a political vision seizable: the conviction that arranged current, from bank monopolies monetary system, to financial crises leads.
Indeed the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (an alias) is both a virtual currency (but in dollar, euro etc. convertable) and minutes for the safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which facilitates the direct exchange of files.
With 15.000 computers in the network already about 200,000 transactions were seized.
Some thousand web pages accept Bitcoin as donation or as currencies.
After the course of Bitcoin had reached a highest level of 30 dollar (23 euros) in June 2011, it fell five months later on 2 dollar, before he recovered today on approximately ten dollar (the courses are specified on the web page bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressing in the comparison to the world trade of material currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless the European central bank (EZB) showed published report in one in October over virtual currencies interest for this.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with largest success”, “in the competition with the dollar or euro” and “similarly the conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other kinds of virtual currencies like the “Credits”, which are used, in order to advance in a video game, which one wins through plays or buy (and sometimes also back-exchange) can.
The social network Facebook likewise developed a such system.
However the trade each mark is controlled and worked on by a central authority.
With Bitcoin all nodes are simultaneous keepers of the invoice book, examiner, money emitter as well as buyer and salesperson.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users takes place in reality between two email addresses in form of an email.
With the difference that the user for each payment can select another address, which guarantees anonymity.
A number of the data standing with this transaction in connection is signed electronically by a double encoding system.
In this way the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Assistance of contents of the file is likewise possible it to guarantee that the acted Bitcoins is present in the invoice book of the public accounts spread in the entire network.
The crucial step consists of registering this new transaction into this book.
This takes place over a mathematical task, which on the computers is started, whereby the winner, who is a kind provisional central banker, possesses the privilege, this additional line to add.
This concerns carving the file up, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic fingerprint.
The computers “take” the new transaction and add it a number, before the whole becomes “hacked”.
The goal is it to find that number which shows a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number were found, the other knots can check easy whether it is the correct.
The transaction is thus permanently linked with the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user to two times amounted to very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to pay want, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other one remains without link, since both different fingerprints possess.
The computer, which solved the task, receives 50 Bitcoins.
For the prevention of an inflation this reward is regularly halved, probably before at the end of 2012.
In the circulation Bitcoins present is thus on 21 million limited, but up to a one hundred millionth divisibly, which leaves a certain clearance…
Beyond that the difficulty of the task with each improvement of the computing power is increased.
The life of the network already had heights and depths.
The web pages, which services for Bitcoin make available, were attacked and the Bitcoin inserts were stolen.
“The used flaw concerns not actual minutes”, insures Pierre Noizat, who introduced straight Paymium, which is an enterprise for the payment with genuine money and which uses network Bitcoin.
The EZB reports also on the possibilities of the money laundering assistance of this anonymous service.
However cash exhibits this lack likewise.
Important participants such as Wikipedia refuse donations of these art.
By others like the blog platform WordPress are accepted it.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann institute analyzed the invoice book in Israel and showed that nearly 80% are not the Bitcoins in the circulation.
In November a “megasale” was started.
“Thirty thousand dollar were exchanged”, are pleased Jon Holmquist, which works for the enterprise Coinabul, which converts Bitcoins in gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is likewise an author of a book concerning this currency, believes firmly in the potential of this technology as transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with genuine money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, uses however Bitcoin for the validation of the transactions, which are cheaper thereby.
Beyond that the owner administers his identity and can remain thus anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with the resellers, and the latters do not have to install new terminals or computer programmes.
They must indicate simply only one address, which of a telephone “photographed and recognized” it can become indicate Pierre Noizat, who insures that he has thousands users.
A general trend is to be registered, with which hierarchical systems are considered in favor of more strongly horizontal aligned systems.
“It will last some time, until Bitcoin succeeds, but 2013 could be a turning point”, prognosticate it.
The EZB sees the different in its report by the way forwards, to evaluate today as highly regarded risks in case of a success of this currency again.

We took off from Afghanistan.
And after it?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA might follow end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army seizes the possession of its territory again, and that its future decides the Afghan population, without expecting everything from us to.
We punished in particular the Afghan farmers, by regarding them as terrorists.
And us with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured one and injured one.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremist, former leaders, that fled to Pakistan, but frequently also of farmers, who refuse an armed foreign presence, like at present the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if them jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek and Tajik to have followed.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgent ones, the latters will be no longer there, if the western countries become discrete.
The departure of the French troops of the base in Nijrab, which I from one with almond trees planted hill observed, which was financed assistance of French credits, took place duly.
The truck and tank convoy flown over by helicopters reached Kabul, without to be attacked.
Starting from at the end of 2014 it no more influxes will give to the Taliban in Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996 the conditions changed.
At that time Kabul was covered and the country due to the fights of the different insurgent groups by the war.
Their seizure of power was regarded at that time as a kind liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the organization Al Qaida, but their situation until today did not improve.
Former Mujahedeen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to hold the women in a subordinated position.
The most important personalities of the antisoviet war came 2001 power.
They have themselves to sell transformed into business doers, by seizing properties of the government, over it as development land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and benefits from the substantial American assignment of subcontracts drew in such a way.
They brought themselves in disrepute, and most of them were not even involved in the fights.
How I heard it in the campaigns, the people desire a government, that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as those, which use themselves American allowances too make could: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people have the war and its ideologies fullly.
While their exile in Iran or Pakistan have they contact to the modern world had, and have their advantages enjoyed.
About 65% of the population are under 25 years; Kabul has now 5 million inhabitant, which a fifth of the total population is.
In the cities the national schools are full from girls such as boys.
One will have to make this young person available, who wants to return neither to the obscurantism of the former parties nor to the corruption of certain executive personnel, jobs.
All, also the armed parties, are possessed by mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is everywhere looked at.
An army is now present.
Are the authorities, under whose command authority it will stand, regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the antisoviet fight strive already for the recovery of the militias in the province, which will withdraw themselves from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have profited from a certain decentralization by the example of the western nations, but by abolishment of the office of the Prime Minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the USA from it wanted to make a centralized state by a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, in particular on the occasion of for April 2014 the planned elections.
However its country depends already for a long time before for the 50's and on foreign assistance.
Industries were developed not again, functional control works are missing and important of aquifer were not repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetable nothing is produced.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country, which was at the basis directed by 30 years war, a state control of the infrastructures would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan would possess immense mineral resources.
This strengthens still the impression that the western countries were only locally, in order to seize its.
Without energy, in order to process the iron or copper ore locally, and/or without means of transport for an export over the mountains is not possible mining industry.
The Chinese left, let the copper mine of Mes Aynak already nearly the international archaeologists (finances from the World Bank) on the enormous Buddhist place their excavations make and remain the most important employers of the province.
Day will it also necessarily to be that Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which to a large extent the retracting and extending are dependent repair normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops was concluded on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement plans the continuation of traditional assistance: Girl and boy High Schools, Institut for French at the Universities of, French Institut, Zusammenarbeit within the military, legal, medical and agricultural range, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009 have a service of “civilian-military actions” of the Ministry for defense (Cimic), which 2012 were adjusted, accomplished in dozens by mountain villages numerous non-profit work and measures for the redevelopment of the agriculture and of a small French non-governmental organization would drive through leave, in order to try, the “hearts and spirit to win” and the impossible task of the compatibility from assistance and offensive actions to reach.
These work, numerous local for which workers were necessary, could contribute to suppress the rebellion: Irrigation, well, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of the agricultural effective areas.
Which souvenir do we leave after military expenditure of two billion euro?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of the local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys often lying at a value of more than 2000 meters.
In the message dozens written requests of small agricultural projects of communities of the province Kapisa were received.
So that the farmers free themselves from the rebellion led by foreign groups, which according to their own statements their desire is, the continuation would be smaller, well more controlled and it civilian assistance directly concerned for their favour necessary.

A condition with the crowbar in Egypt
This concerns a new poker game of president Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more than ever split regarding the bill of rights, which grants it temporarily the unrestricted authority, it decided to set everything on a map.
For the surprise of all it announced on Wednesday that the condition-giving meeting will adopt its final version on the next day.
Straight ago of one week the head of state had granted two additional months for the conclusion of his work to this plenum.
Egypt relies now for nearly two years on a provisional, several times amended text, which weakens and to a legal disorder leads institutional stability.
This new initiative provided only for a still stronger splitting of the country.
For his opponents the president in its “autocratic delirium” remains, by breaking further “its word” and “the right with feet steps”.
On sides of its proponents one insures that it is a way to terminate the institutional and political crisis as fast as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
Within 14 days a referendum should be held.
To explain a very short period, which forces the brothers to do without their project the Egyptians the text section for section.
For the president it is also a way to regain its public and democratic legitimacy while the protest raves generally speaking country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American newsreel time seems to be convinced of the fact Mohammed Mursi that the Egyptians will vote in a well-meaning manner.
Particularly one places to the Egyptian people with this falling back to a vote an ultimatum over-hurried: “Either you tune for my draft or I keep the unrestricted authority”, the latters should after acceptance of the condition an end take allegedly.
85 to a large extent Islamist members of this condition-giving meeting adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberals did not follow the request.
Shortly before the bill of rights November they turned in the middle of away, since they the opinion are that they were not able to emphasize their aspects.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or the civil society acted equally.
For the reaching of the quorum yesterday morning in great haste 11 persons, were added deputy members.
Some are close to the Muslim brothers much.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly unanimously discharged.
The commentators found it by the way entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day came… in time for the prayer to the expression, there some members of the committee of the opinion were that the pendulum clock of the condition-giving meeting did not go exactly.
The text, which was still adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention on itself, remains finally identical to that one for the condition of 1971 and means that “the principles of the sharia are the main source of the right”.
The salafistischen parties, for which the establishment of the Islamic right is an important demand, had to replace hope, “the principles” by “the rules”, which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists the fact that this article was not changed, is a proof for their good will and for their respect opposite the other members of the Egyptian society.
“The liberals, who regard this only as propaganda impact, answer hypocrisy”.
Because according to them the islamisation of the condition is made by other articles.
They have particularly article 220 in the eye, which awards an advisory function to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular regarding the examination of the conformity with the laws of the sharia.
According to the Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier is disturbing this, since “the persons, who are requested to a statement, were not selected and no democratic legitimacy possess.
One can see herein the first signs of a theocracy”.
In addition the fears of the liberals are fed by the fact that the next rector of this university might be by far less moderate than the current.
“At present no concrete religious commitment is to be recognized.
With this condition we remain in the context of the civil state.
Most lawyers, who worked on this text, are not Ulema, but university graduates, which were trained partially in the French system”, appease Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctorate over the Egyptian Verfassungstransition.
It grants however, “that regarding the article 220 an ambiguity be present can, since the used terms are taken to the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the “Fiqh” [Islamic jurisdiction, note D. Talk.].
And in the future the question could be raised, to what extent civil court judges are competent, on it to decide.”
Apart from its religious aspect the text adopted yesterday is criticized strongly due to the extensive powers, which it grants to the president of the republic.
The Muslim brothers argue that these are clearly reduced compared to the former regime.
A further point at issue: the powers of the army.
In conformity with the desire of the military the examination of the defense budget is submitted not to the parliament, but a national defence council.
Likewise it will not give prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, how the combinations demanded it for the defense of the human rights.
The latters communicate likewise their fears regarding the text, which they regard as freedom-threatening.
The facts of the blasphemy are maintained, and offenses are now forbidden, what could have serious consequences for the right to free expression of opinion, in particular for the press.
Beyond that no more article refers to the protection of the women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to their opinion the only positive point is the prohibition of the torture by article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous condition.
While the Egyptian president had to express itself last night on TV, demonstrations for this afternoon are planned.
The proponents of the head of state will deploy Saturday.

In Israel Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world and a sea from brine
The promised land unites the glory of Biblical truths, modern comfort and an untouched nature in itself.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit in Israel.
Before the holy places bow
Visit the jordan river, in which Jesus was baptized.
It means that all, which bathe in this river receive God benedictions.
Galiläa is the place, at which of Jesus its miracles achieved: the transformation of water in wine on a wedding ceremony, going on the water, satisfying the sea-tower and fishing.
Jesus its Jüngern appeared just here after resurrection.
Most shrines are however in Jerusalem.
Religious ones commit here the suffering way and/or crossroad Jesu Christi (on latin: Via Dolorosa).
The way begins with the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads by the roads of the old part of town to the grave church on the mountain Golgotha, where the crucifixion place, the anointing stone and the grave Jesu are.
Here is after Christian view of the navels of the world, which the salvation of mankind symbolizes.
The monastery of the holy cross in Jerusalem stands at the place, at which according to the tree grew a Christian legend, from which the cross for crucifixion Jesu was made.
In Jerusalem also the holiest place of the Jews is - the Wailing Wall, the remnants of a temple, that from the Romans in the year 70 n. Chr. one destroyed.
Traditionally there humans of different persuasions leave notes with desires, which go then into fulfillment.
A journey up undertake
The ruins of the fortress Massada form the remnants of the secret hiding place before enemies, the Herodes the large one in the year 25 n. Chr. for his family to build let.
They are because of a cliff in the mountains into 450 meters height above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins from own strength.
A wire ropeway brings all different to this historical summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous skiing area Hermon, into which it pulls innumerable tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you arrive there with a shuttle bus.
The ski runs have an overall length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend allegedly heathen Gods on the mountain summit lived.
Singular museums visit
In this country there are nearly 300 museums.
With only one journey not all can be visited of it.
But at least the five most interesting of them a visit should be paid.
Among them once the Israel museum is nearby the Knesset (parliament).
There old Qumranhandschriften or scrolls by the dead sea, which was found in rock caves in the Judäi desert, is kept as well as approximately 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
Also the museum OF kind in Tel Aviv is worth a visit.
There the collection is issued by works of the Impressionisten and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the bath Al Basha, which accommodates several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bath servants at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the singular private Ralli museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There there are neither to museum leader nor souvenir shops.
The entrance is free, and donations are in principle rejected.
The fifth museum, i.e. the Holocaust museum and/or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tell of one of the most shaking chapters of history.
The moving department is the monument for the children, which was built to the memory of the 1.5 million children, who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the area complete darkness prevails.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries ring out, in whom they died.
Also Ukraine is mentioned there.
Something for the health do
The three most important recreation areas of Israel are because of the banks of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the dead sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphin airs and ocean airs.
In the Red Sea also in the winter months one bathes surprisingly, since the water temperature does not fall there under 21 °C and air warms up to 23 °C.
The dead sea is even still more warmly and there is throughout the year bathed.
By the way this unusual sea with a situation of 417 meters under the sea level is the most deeply convenient sea of the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has high salinity and carries thereby even nonswimmers problem-free on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments with use of seawater (natural brine) and welfare mud as well as to the treatment of nerves strained by skin inflammations, allergies, asthma, eczemas, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar illness and to the calming.
The secrets of the antiquity affect
The old part of town of Tel Aviv saves these secrets, i.e. the city Jaffa at the Mediterranean coast.
By this city ran the famous sea route, which interconnected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in old-Greek and old-Egyptian legends.
According to excessive quantities Noah built straight its ark here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he led a long and happy life at this place.
Tourists saunter gladly by the close lanes, which are designated after asterisks.
Fortuna is to be the legend after all hold, which affect the walls in the lane with their asterisk.
In Jaffa you can find neuvermählte pairs from all of Israel and even different countries with photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of king Herodes, you can touch by the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the crusaders.
In the Roman time Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and Residenz of the Roman governors, under it also Pontius Pilatus.
In the carefully restored theatre nowadays evening concerts and operas are specified.
Noticing list for tourists
If you drive to Israel, do not worry yourselves because of your bad command of English: Approximately 30% of the Israelis speak Russian.
One rather carries the money forward in the journey in no euros, but in dollars, which can be changed simply in Shekels (current rate of exchange: 1 dollar to 3.8 Shekels).
In the city you advance mostly with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa the only underground line of the country with six stations, which the lower part of town connects with the upper city.
Strictly speaking it is an underground endless rope haulage system.
A trip within the city costs independently of the means of transport 6 Shekels, hands inclusive transferring for a trip from up to 1,5 hours.
In accordance with Jewish tradition in Israel of Saturday the Sabbath is committed.
From Friday evening to the sunset on Saturday markets and business are closed, and which rests public traffic.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants only kosher meal is served, which excludes pork, sea products, fish without sheds and meals, which contain both milk and meat products.
Instead you have the choice between different courts with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (prepares with coconut milk), traditional Jewish leaf mould paste, different sauces, deep-fried small balls from puréeed beans and peas (falafel) as well as fruits and vegetables.
In the roads of Israeli cities there are no stray dogs.
But there are many well-fed cats, which roam comfortably and undisturbed by the roads.
In the evening one sees it even sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats may say encouraged places and not no to treats.
A rented car costs dollar per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 dollar (Audi A6, Volvo S80) depending upon mark between 37.
The insurance costs additionally 15 dollar per day.
And bike hire costs 15 Shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost 30 Shekels on average.
In figures
In the year 2012 more than three million tourist from all over the world visited Israel.
The most adventurers and recovery-looking for came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came into the promised land, which corresponds to a rise of 51% in relation to the comparison period in the year 2010, before the abolition of the visa obligation on 9 February 2011.

“The large and powerful” lead to Moscow: Migranten save money for language
While delegates and civil rights activists discuss, the law over obligatory language tests brings which benefit for Migranten, criminal ones act already with falsified certificates
Come annually 13 million immigrant worker to Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of the central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is it to make money for the maintenance of the families remained in the homeland.
On 1 December a law came into force, according to which each work migrant a test, which certifies knowledge of the Russian language, must placings.
So far is valid this regulation only for Migranten, which in the service sector, in which local housing industry and in the retail trade want to work.
However the tests are to become future with the time according to federal migration authority for all immigrant workers the obligation.
One not only language test, but also test must in Russian history and the bases of the legislation placing.
Linguistic knowledge must be proven both for the receipt and the extension of the work permit.
Exceptions are valid only for citizens of countries, official language is Russian in which.
Likewise exceptionally from this law are persons, who received their training certifications and diplomas before the decay of the USSR in the year 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of the rights
The whole of the test places becomes under the auspice of institute for Pushkin for the Russian language, the Russian university of the people friendship, the Muscovite of state university, which sank Petersburger of state university and other Russian universities.
The Migranten knows the tests in all cities placings; in Russia already more than 160 appropriate centers were already opened.
The initiative for the introduction of the tests was supported by the delegates of the state Dumas and the federal migration authority.
Civil rights activists however asked the following question before the entry into force of the law in the press several times: What actually brings the whole?
Which changes does the regulation bring to have to show linguistic knowledge both for the Russians and for the immigrant workers?
Above all, spokesmen of the migration authority answer, go it around reducing the number of the forced laborers.
“Many talk now about the protection of the rights about Arbeitsmigranten”, say the director/conductor of the agency of the federal migration authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
Their rights must be however already protected against its departure.
Only an organized recruitment will solve the problems of foreign workers to 90%.
Problems Migranten without occupation, education, linguistic knowledge and medical investigation encounter.
Sebelew is of it convinced that a future migrant without linguistic knowledge will meet inevitably humans with bad intentions, it under the pretext of assistance into a dark, close barrack puts, where he will slave away with dozens of his sort months without meals and documents to endure and 12 to 14 hours on the day.
Many complaints of our Migranten reach us.
“In the homeland you the one is promised, and with the arrival you are cheated, get their passports decreased and received not the promised wages”, confirm the director/conductor of the head office for workers' migration of the Tajik migration authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Do not grumble, boss!
Many citizens of the central Asian republics, which want to make their money in Russia, admit nevertheless the fact that they do not know not only the language of the country of destination but also in their own language to hardly in writing express itself can.
That is natural not so much their debt, as rather the evil: Only few Turkmens, Uzbek and Tajik can afford only a reasonable primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money, in order to nourish the children, let alone, them decent clothes to buy shoes and school things.
As teenagers these children take then immediately the first opportunity to the money making.
“It is difficult without linguistic knowledge”, admits it.
“You feel degraded and inferior.”
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect concerning the law.
The test must only Migranten with legal status placing.
If you do not have this status, then there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile the majority of the immigrant workers is further illegaly in Russia.
“Cordial welcome” or “admission for unauthorized ones forbade”
Many Migranten confirm that it is not simple, in Russia an official status to receive.
The reason are natural bureaucratic hurdles and the linguistic difficulties.
In addition the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand roubles.
One can make a falsified registration fast and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that our documents are not registered to a large extent falsified and we, and from this develop then cases of extortion.
“You want in or two hundred roubles for cigarettes and tea”, express yourselves the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow opposite journalists.
“Bare costs of wrong papers are not afraid”
Already on the day, on which the law stepped into force, it turned out that the registration documents of the Migranten cannot only be falsified.
Some falsified certificates, which certify completing the language test, were already fitting-taken by employees of the federal migration authority.
The falsified papers were printed with a usual color printer.
Naturally the new owners did not receive these in vain: Each migrant, which hoped, to be able to save so the tests paid seven thousand roubles for the document.
That is more than twice as much like the costs of the official test: This costs a Arbeitsmigranten three thousand roubles.
Over the fact that the most important direct task consists of protecting the system against corruption so that the certificates cannot be simply bought is both office-holders and civil rights activists unite.
For the moment the authorities immigrant workers, who fall with the first time by the test, can promise only that they receive time for a language basic course.
Beyond that places within ranges are offered to newcomers without linguistic knowledge, within which no active communication with humans is necessary.

Ministry of the Interior ignores illegal weapon market
Portion of legal weapons of criminal offences extremely small
The Russian ministry of the Interior plans an aggravation of the weapon law for private owners of weapon.
With it the authorities react to the recent events: Injured with shootings on weddings as well as seven dead with the rampage the Muscovite of the lawyer Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to forbid carrying non-deadly weapons in the public and the age for the possession of firearms of 18 to 21 years to raise.
The chairman of the Duma committee for security and corruption fight, Irina Jarowaja, supported the proposal and promised that the changes at the weapon law are submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not all are content with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by “attraction of the screws”.
In the Internet an open letter was published, whose author - representatives of different weapon federations - of the authorities demands to take from “senseless aggravations” distance.
The percent of the crimes with registered weapons is very small, expressed the Strafrechtler, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the ministry of the Interior 142 crimes with use of the registered weapons in the process of six months in 2012 were committed, while for the same period altogether 1.168 thousand crimes were registered.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that an aggravation of the law for private owners of weapon will not hold criminal ones from it, to avail itself on the black market.
At present one can find according to in Moscow each possible weapon for little money to the authors.
Meanwhile the ministry of the Interior stresses that the spreading of illegal weapons under control is.
Supplier: from the factories to the officers
The weapons arrive over several channels at the black market.
There are five such forward channels, tell former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who was active ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the general staff.

The first channel is the army and/or the military, i.e. weapons, which were stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and the Kaukasiern themselves”, say Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, which are stolen from vigilantes by criminal ones.
Baranez describes that for this weapons count, which were stolen both from the weapon chambers of the police and directly by employees of the law enforcement agencies.
Further illegaly sold weapons originate from military weapon camps.
With many military camps it came frequently to explosions.
“There are proofs that it concerned with some cases arson, to hush up around the absence from weapons to”, say the former military personnel.
Also the weapon manufacturers make a contribution to the black market in accordance with Baranez.
“Nowadays there are innumerable private war plants, those the international competition does not withstand and therefore the weapons under the hand on the black market, approximately in Moscow, does not dissipate”, reports the expert.
A further channel of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There there is a its own, production sometimes relating to crafts as well as a mafia, smuggling organized”, describes the former military personnel.
From where do the weapons come?
Experts computed, each of the five channels at the supply of the black market with illegal weapons has which portion approximately.
In the year 2011 a report was written by the center for analyses of problems and national administration.
The experts analyzed reports of the ministry of the Interior and the federal service for national statistics, kriminologische literature and publicly accessible data on portals about weapons.
The predominant part of the illegal weapons comes the investigators according to from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the “debt of responsible persons, those in their work with weapons to do arrived”, are called it in the report.
The data according to the researcher 17% of the weapons originate from conflict areas, 14% decrease on thefts with weapon production, and 5% originate from illegal excavations.
A merchandiser of a weapon shop, which does not want to be mentioned by name, insures that for a long time nobody buys weapons, which are found with illegal excavations more, since they became outdated.
According to it is more frequent that resellers procure themselves the supplies in a weapon camp.
Over a wo1 a weapon, for example a pistol of the type TT, is bought.
The weapon is issued and handed over by the fence.
“There the reseller brings the weapon into the city and sells her for 900 euros per piece with two magazines”, tells he
“The police knows naturally about all and leads therefore, if it cannot keep the plan for uncovering of crimes, periodically control purchases with resellers through, who offer, add illegal weapons” the merchandiser.
“As in the luxury shop”
Buyers and salespersen find most frequently over acquaintance to each other.
I had regarded web pages and blogs, became attentive as someone on me and me suggested to the station “Begowaja” coming, where a person would wait for me, who would bring me to a certain place, where we could negotiate then the price.
I experienced the price for the weapon only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
“Around a weapon to procure, I need an acquaintance, who has contacts”, tells the merchandiser. “I have so an acquaintance, but I do not trust him”.
There are resellers on the markets, but there one must go and arrange oneself with a code as “from Iwan Iwanowitsch, who lets align that the daughter lost a tooth”.
I come at present even to some impact rings over an acquaintance, who I trust.
It supplies the impact rings to me with likewise only, because he knows that I do not blow the whistle him.
Beginners look for weapons on different ways.
The former military personnel Viktor Baranez in the middle of the 1990er tried as a buyer of illegal weapons, when he wrote an article to this topic.
The patterns did not change according to it.
He got a photo album, in which “all possible one” was shown.
“I felt as in the luxury shop”, remember the military personnel.
The buyer gets the cat in the bag according to Baranez not, but can everything out try.
I as a potential customer buy not simply only, but drive with the salesperson into the forest, and there we set up a target.
“I can shoot then there, and if I am convinced of it that the weapon has a good shot, negotiate we with one another”, describe the expert the action.
Buy from the sofa
Internet search engines point search results to web pages and groups in “Vkontakte”, where weapons are offered “for different purposes”.
Neither any papers are needed nor give it personal meetings.
“You need only the suitable sum money”, are called it in the advert on the web page “combat pistol or rifle buy”.
There user your orders gives up and places inquiries.
Also to persons under age one sells?
“Natural without license”, asks user “Iwan” (literal quotation).
“Purchase a TT. Moscow”, reads the laconic inquiry of “Fedorenkow”.
The federal security agency switched recently innumerable illusory web pages, and buyers, who want to acquire weapons, go to the service in droves into the net.
The people come like hungry fish with feeding and land then in Siberia and may coal dig
Military commentator and former military members Viktor Baranez
I heard of the following pattern: The web page is normally abroad registered, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible persons accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a cash-point dispenser.
“As answer it receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon”, reports the press spokesman of the nonprofit organization “Pravo well oryzhie” Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez stresses that one can go out in the end also empty and come behind the bars, if one places an inquiry on a web page.
The federal security agency switched recently innumerable illusory web pages, and buyers, who want to acquire weapons, go to the service in droves into the net.
“The people come like hungry fish with feeding and land then in the Siberian labour camp and may coal dig”, say he.
A Makarow for 100 US Dollar
With the purchase of illegal firearms experts according to with prices from 100 to 900 US Dollar is to be counted.
According to Dmitrij Kislow of the organization “Pravo well oryzhie” one can buy a pistol of the type Makarow for 100 to 300 dollar.
One must wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is spent in military weapon camps by custodians of middle rank.
The official statistics of the ministry of the Interior according to the number of the crimes with illegal weapons decreased in all of Russia in the period of January until October 2011 around 7% on 22.9 thousand, while the number of the uncovered cases of theft and extortion shrank in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and blowing up devices around 7,8%.

In the USA nearly Food and supermarket persons employed strike
Each fourth US-American young person sits sometime behind the cash of Mc Donald's
In the past days it came everywhere in the USA to substantial protests against low wages into branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular nearly Food chains like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Still nobody can predict whether the protests will continue to swell still or whether them already soon again air goes out.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing oriented nonprofit organizations.
Apart from the increase of the modest wages of simple Walmart and nearly Food persons employed the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of creating trade unions.
So far this industry of the economy is hardly into a union organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests began past week after Thanksgiving, at the so-called Black Friday, at which in the USA sellouts took place, which attracted millions of customers, which led occasionally to melees.
On this day some Walmart employees, from whom there is world-wide 2.2 million, laid down their work and closed by strike together with trade unions and link activists branches of the chain, whose target audience persons of low and middle income are.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers over hunting rifles and car batteries up to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The commodity in the Walmart branches is more favorable on average between 8 and 27% than in large supermarkets.
Therefore many buy the slightly paid Walmart persons employed only on the own job.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest enterprises in the USA.
According to critics Walmart can sell the commodity so favorably often only, because the employees are badly paid.
The latters complain also about heavy conditions of work, for example missing fork-lift trucks or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests in “Black Friday” demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance over the fact that the contribution for the health insurance in-house of 30 to 100 dollar had risen in the month.
A typical Walmart employee, who earns 9.5 US Dollar the hour, can not afford this increase, said her.
Researchers from the California university in Berkeley prove that, if the enterprise increases the average wage to 12 dollars the hour it would cost Walmart 3.2 billion dollars.
Those are approx. 1.1% more than it now for wages donate.
If Walmart would surround the wage increases completely on the customers, each purchase cost her in the future only to 46 cent more.
Per year would be for it compared with today additional costs of only 12.39 dollars.
Proponents of Walmart state contently that it came only into nine Federal States to protests and no losses gave these to the enterprise.
Black Friday took the next day in the evening into its loading from 8 o'clock on Thursday to midnight, and in this period Walmart sold approximately 5000 articles per second.
Altogether the Walmart cashes at “Black Friday” implemented nearly 100 million transactions.
The spokesman of the enterprise, Dan Fogelman, maintained post office in an interview on the web page the left-wing oriented hoof catching tone that altogether “less than five” Walmart employees laid down the work and the protest action “a further PR-trick” of the trade union, which organized the protests had only been.
“Free cash!”
The protests continued to go this week into New York, where their goal however not Walmart branches (in this progressive city desired and therefore nonexistent are not), but McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants were.
McDonald's says, which sells enterprises billion portions, and nevertheless one does not grant you no sick days, and it paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member New Yorker town councillor
At present the minimum wage is in accordance with federal and New Yorker legislation about 7.25 dollar the hour.
In nearly Food restaurants the minimum wage is gradually raised, however not too strongly, and their simple employees in New York 8.90 US Dollar on the average get the hour.
Less than it nobody earns in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along in New York with so little money is incomprehensible me.
There was once a time, in which nearly after the school at McDonald's behind the bar, however the young people lived a quarter of all US-American young people still with their parents.
Hardly one saw therein the main source of income or planned to remain longer there.
Now with interviews with employees of McDonald's constantly meet me humans, who deplore themselves that sometimes they must get along with this wages and nourish even their children.
On the other hand there is a comment, whose author marks, in the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal it is irresponsible to get children if one does not know, how one is to nourish her.
The participants of the protests, which began in the morning on Thursday at 6.30 o'clock before McDonald's in the 40th Street and in Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks receive a minimum wage from nearly Food restaurants from 15 US Dollar the hour, which corresponds to more than a duplication of the current minimum wage.
They demanded further the formation of trade unions in the nearly Food industry.
The US-American law forbids it to the management standing to this goal in the way and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand the management does not make it simple for them.
In addition, the establishment of trade unions in the nearly Food industry is difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high labor turnover.
Dissatisfied one
There were loud protests on this day also before many other nearly Food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protests was a meeting at noon before McDonald's at the Times Square, with which some spoke local democrat, among them town councilman Jumaane Williams, which said: “McDonald's says, it sells billion portions, and nevertheless one does not grant you sick days, and it for your honest work are not paid!”
The demonstrators were supported also by other prominent New Yorker democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should support together the nearly Food employees, so that they can receive fair wages and achieve the economic prosperity each New Yorker one earned!”.
According to New York Times this was the largest action of their kind in the history of the US-American nearly Food industry.
However only some hundred humans were locally, by whom by far not all are busy in the nearly Food industry, in which in New York tens of thousands work.
Still it is not to be foreseen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.

“The brain can be outwitted so far only moderately”
The topic of the extended reality liked with supporters of modern technologies is noticed lately usually by the lens of special eyeglasses.
Google presented first in the summer at its annual conference a functioning model, in November it became then admits that also Microsoft had announced an appropriate patent.
In the discussion with the director/conductor of the group for interactive 3D-Technologien in the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes however clear that the eyeglasses for the scientists of the enterprise were only one passage station.
It provokes the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in air with bare hands and of creating virtual open spaces.
- Describing you asks briefly, your group operates which research.
- We concern ourselves with the interaction of humans and machine, want to extend thereby however the borders of this interaction.
So far mankind is in the phase to a large extent puts remained, in which with pixels on flat screens one works, which are sometimes also affected.
We however want to look further ahead 5-10 years and to foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and nowadays no more Xbox without Kinect one sells, since all are interested in movement control.
- Which expects us still in the future?
- Although Kinect brought the interaction on a physical level, much takes place still on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the edition so far not yet crucially.
We try to change, work on genuine three-dimensional representation systems on the basis of different technologies, under it projections.
We must dismiss the computer world into our physical world and make them more understandable.
In addition it is however necessary that not only the user, but also its environment are recognized.
Then we could supplement the real world many more simply by virtual objects.
And first of all we should become loose these crazy Virtual Reality helmets!
- Which you think of language control?
It is likes, but it is not overestimated?
- You is surely not the general-purpose solution, since it raises questions to the privacy, because one would not always like to inform all standing around about its actions and intentions.
Actually each kind of interaction with computers is well, however everyone in its certain niche.
For example we worked within the range of the control of objects on public squares on a project, with which we experimented with short and scarce, instead of with unloading gestures.
The gestures were noted not by the object camera, but by a bracelet, which registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
Still it is relatively large, could be made smaller theoretically however on the size of a wrist-watch.
But altogether the future belongs to controller types, for example gesturing however mixed and language.
- Like that?
- We would ask you me for example to hand you this mineral water box?
They say it and interpret at the same time on it.
- Normally I say it simply only.
- Oh, would be very difficult to recognize.
- Is called that, you want that the user adapts to, which can carry a machine out to the respective time and which not?
- Not necessarily, but it concerns here a mutual approach.
I think that we will work very soon particularly on the development of new sensor types to have, which make it possible to seize reactions of persons more exactly.
That for example laser sensors can be, since they offer a good dissolution in the depth, which is very important.
- Which requirements place you on the basis of your work with Xbox Kinect sensors to modern cameras?
Does it lack other one dissolution, depth or some more?
- The current generation is in the reason a good starting point for our work within the range of the three-dimensional recognition.
Naturally 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 would not be bad fps.
But the main thing are not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So seen all present technologies for us are not good enough, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
Not only the dissolution must be considered along the x and Y, but also along the Z-axis.
Also the speed and the number of pictures per second are important.
The movements of humans are extremely dynamically and openly said, are current 30 fps in particular for gestures the too few.
Stephen Betishes developed a contact sensor with an adjustable processing delay in our laboratory in Redmond between 1 to 100 milliseconds, whereby the today's commercial sensors were more near because of the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand, how much that affects the interaction of humans and machine.
For my work I needed exactly the same a device, only without contact control and with more pictures per second.
- Wouldn't have to be increased the number of cameras?
- Kinect works at present with three “cameras”, whereby of it an infrared transmitter and second are actually a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual RGB camera.
It does not serve for calculation the object depth.
More cameras could possibly the problem loosen…
Or the problem strengthen, since more calculations would be necessary.
A flexible, Kinect similar system would be beautiful, with which we could play with different camera inclinations, in order to determine, how helps us with the three-dimensional determination a position.
- If I quite remember, presented Microsoft contrary to Google its eyeglasses not the public.
Don't you think that regarding the application of the technology of the extended reality in the everyday life the eyeglasses have the best prospects?
- Natural is not pleasant it to always hold on the way smartphones in the edifying hand but I think the following: The greatest variant would be a “changing” extended reality, with which we could switch over a Cloud of the eyeglasses to the smartphones,
The eyeglasses are a personal Gadget and in it lie their strength (only you), but at the same time also their weakness can see private, because an extended reality by means of eyeglasses prevents that you can work together with others on virtual objects.
- Places we us one moment long forwards that the manipulation of virtual holograms in air one did not only normal-bleach Tony Stark from Iron, but also is accessible.
There is a problem, to which critics of this idea refer frequently: There is no perceptible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
Which answers does your group want to give on this objection?
- In my lectures I speak often of the fact that the extended reality represents the seventh break-through with the interaction between humans and machine.
I think, which respects break-through could quite the integration of the tactile perception become.
An interesting method is at present the use of the second hand as somewhat unusual projection document.
She notices pressure outstanding!
In addition, there are technologies, which are aligned actually to it, to lend to the “pictures in air” something strong for example produces the interference of some directed ultrasonic beams in a certain point, where the finger is, a feeling, which is momentarily however still so weak, as if blew someone over the hands.
There are also volumes for the wrist, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers, also that is a potential direction.
- Credit you tries to outwit the brain?
To think it lets that it feels, what it feel should, if it sees straight something?
- That is a good idea, then we did not try it yet.
Here a further task, with which we will have to fight still for a long time, hides itself i.e. humans, who are physically in a closed area, believes to leave, it is instead in an open, practically infinite area; here we work on concepts with run volumes (others than in fitness studios), mobile platforms as well as large balls.
So far the brain can be outwitted only moderately, and before us still many years work-filled lie.
Straight one makes the work so attractive on the area of the virtual reality for a researcher: With many topics we stand only at the beginning.

Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project “Petersburger avant-garde”, which is dedicated to city dwellers, who form the avant-garde of the art and culture.
On the exquisite list already high-ranking representatives of the Petersburger art scene landed, their success beyond the borders of the city go and those acknowledgment into Europe to often find, without in the rest from Russia admit to be.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artists Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, who in red dressed bearded one, which one finds times with the Russian museum, times with the summer garden, times with scene meetings or on vernissages.
Where the pictures are always issued by Kirill Miller also, they attract large human being masses.
Kirill Miller is one the typical Petersburger social action-philosophical artist, who creates new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburger avant-garde end of the 80's and/or at the beginning of the 90's.
He is also a man of the city and does magic by his presence on the road its fellow citizens a smile in the face and ensures with them for good mood.
Recently it snatched a turning organ and became the Petersburger turning organ player, there it for this difficult role regarding its artist existence, its philosophy and its image finally ready felt.
- Kirill, why you are actually always in red and not for example in yellow or turquoise in the city on the way?
I selected the color red as fashion designer, which argues with the optics and the image.
In this world red is the compromise between artists, image advisors and society.
In the society everything that deviates something from the grey standard, calls aggressions and bad behavior out.
I want to come however by my provocations with humans into the discussion.
Everyone of my past provocations was an invitation to the discussion.
- When you knew that you must become painters?
- With an exhibition in the cultural palace Newskij, with which my work was issued.
I understood that I must go this way.
Then the time of the old free went, however not officially recognized painters at that time in the end, and new and free painters as I were incomprehensible.
I got used to myself with the painters of the new generation, thus with the representatives of the “Gazonewschina”; from this “Puschkinskaja 10” developed, and then was for a start conclusion.
Me it pulls to the theatre, to mode, to the music, actually to everything, except the literature.
- And all the united itself in your kind hospital… - It was important to me to be located in the center of the Petersburger culture where the best creative artists should meet.
In the year 1995 I occupied an area in the Puschkinskaja 10, and there there was an musical-artistic club for the Boheme, the house of the Petersburger Boheme up to the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I remembers also, how cord with its project “Ucho Van Goga” came there.
Cord and its friends sang simple songs to the Play-back, wore close tricots and to them belonged also the composer Igor Wdowin announced today.
When the group began to play live “Leningrad” became from it.
Traditional costume mountain moderated many programs before the time of “Halli Galli”.
We gave them traditional costume mountain, and it began its large career, but it learned the bases with us.
Also the gallery “D 137” or the club “Griboedov” has its origin in the kind hospital.
There our employees and regular customers went.
I am a hero of the past century, when culture some more meant.
In the year 2000 there was a survey in the press, with which it the honor “personalities of our city” concerned.
I won in the category “artist of the year”, and thus I had arrived at the high point.
It is not easy to work in recent times according to old rules; I am humans of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In the today's time it is simple to become famous but culture and popularity are not the same: One can be famous, without making thereby a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are genuine beads and bring clearly the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts on the expression.
I will have an exhibition with the topic “the Russian museum as clowns”.
Clowns are timeless.
In former times I was social action, but it hurts now and prepares fear to be like that.
In a clown smeared that everything and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesqueness, and I have grotesque ideas.
We save for example the world, by prescribing that everyone has to disguise itself completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves at the exterior and not at the inside of humans.
But perhaps one may to humans not the hand give, but should him in the face spit.
The deception disappears by disguising.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban turning organ player. - A cultural city should have so a hero.
Who, if not I?
- Can be beautiful also commercial art?
- Nowadays commercial art must be carefully, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of the cultures.
In former times humans formed large groups: The Bohemiens loved and the simple people the other one.
Now there are micro communities, and it is difficult to please all.
I am not a one hundred-dollar note, which pleases everyone.
Now you must consider yourself, you will please whom.
Now each cult star has approximately 100 supporters.
- Come to the appearances of Stas Michailow however several thousands!
- To him abandoned women come, there play the sexual-social sphere a role.
From cultural reasons 300 persons and 10 not thousand come, therefore there is fewer managements, money, and everything perishes.
I have supporters, and who am most important one, not to destroy it not too would amount to and the reached.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which hung with a collecting tank even in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I began with pictures, which come normally only in the end the career.
Nowadays there are often misunderstandings.
It means: mental culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has at all no culture, that is somewhat completely different one.
I am humans of the past culture and buildup with artists, who lived in poverty and died in poverty and rejected money, in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture, which I endorse.
- Kirill, which is missing to Petersburg?
- Property cultural expert.
One says: Servant of the culture.
But everyone of them cannot be concerned with culture.
With the genuine tsars was it different, because the tsars did not understand perhaps much of culture, but they understood that correct experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are at present good advisors.
In Petersburg we have which, which could be experts, but the way is blocked to them, since it requires hochrangigerer experts, who correctly evaluate the first and for them the way free.
Now only the own taste counts.
The same is valid for the Erarta, however with the difference that they say honestly that they accept not all contemporary art and some painters must look for each other therefore different museums.
- Which is for you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is more culture and an appropriate fertile soil much.
On our stones art can grow up only with difficulty.
We need a cultural fertile soil, because for example we have meanwhile more writer than readers, and that is not correct nevertheless.
In Europe there are many curious humans, who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us are those much less.
Art must be again modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from subsidies of the city Saint Petersburg

Birth in the universe
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earth inhabitants on board make themselves on the search for a spare planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question arises, how we can reproduce ourselves in weightlessness or on the spare planet?
There are not many options in my opinion.
De facto there are only two genuine planets, which we could inhabit at least hypothetically.
“, The research associate of astronomical institute for Sternberg Wladimir Surdin says Mars and Venus”.
While however the conditions on Mars are comparatively life friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees prevails on the surface of the Venus.
Life would be only in large height or in the orbit of the Venus, thus in the universe, possible.
The researchers treated the question of the reproduction in the universe first regarding the flora.
A half century before it experiments with plants were already accomplished.
The fourth generation of the peas bred in the orbit did not differ in the slightest from the terrestrial kinds.
Breeding of insects followed, more exactly from tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In the year 1979 quail eggs were sent into the universe, in order to investigate, how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
A completely normal chicken develops.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem consists of the fact that the chicken stop must find; it must be able to stand for Wladimir Sychew on its legs and begin, to move”, describes the laboratory leader of the institute for medical-biological problems near.
Without firm underground the chickens estimated themselves wildly.
Ten hours later blunted the instincts of the newborn children completely.
The chickens did not react to light and sounds.
Four days later died it then simply.
“Twice we let chickens slip and adjusted the whole then, because it is simply impossible, there with them to work”, hold Wladimir Sychew to the failed experiment with the chickens in the universe.
The last breeding cage with animals flew before 16 years to the orbit.
In the spring 2013 the experiments are continued.
However on the bio satellite “Bion” only same sex species will be.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent already fertilized into the universe.
In principle thereby nothing special was determined.
“That was straight with the bio satellites, but again it was only individual experiment, and which must research are continued”, notice Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing the space rats got new generation.
One could not solve the problem of the reproduction directly in space so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals, which are torn from their natural habitat, cannot follow simply their reproductive drive.
Contrary to animals humans could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can produce a similar emotional background.
From ethical considerations such experiments are not accomplished.
But women fly already for 50 years to the universe.
The largest risk gave it with Tereschkowa.
The most valuable, which possesses mankind, is the female organism.
Our sea gull flew away, and nobody on earth could have answered the following question: Does it get over the space flight?
Will it be able to bring a child after this flight to the world?
“Final one answered anybody this question”, does not say space veteran awake seaweed Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after their space flight, bore the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereschkowa, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was likewise a cosmonaut.
In the year 1988 the second Mrs. in the universe, Swetlana Sawizkaja, bore who was twice in the orbit and performed even work outside of the spacecraft, a son.
Nevertheless a risk remains.
We have only extremely few cosmonauts, with whom to long flights everything went well and it got healthy new generation.
“The more, the more dangerously is it during flights into the orbit”, concludes cosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian federation.
And nevertheless mankind must after new ways in the biotechnology, which radiation protection and producing artificial gravitation search.
The hydraulic laboratory in the preparation center of the cosmonauts is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here in a state of suspension the cosmonauts routine for the work in open space win.
The water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults water feel as pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but babies feel water as natural element.
It is, as if the small Ichtyander certification of the fact became placings that the life at the country got out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is about 9 months in the belly of the mother in the amniotic fluid, and that it can get accustomed then more easily at water.
In principle that is logical, since starting from the birth up to first swimming straight once 2 weeks offense.
“That is too little time, around somewhat too forgotten”, says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child weightlessness is thus a much more natural condition, the woman does not get along without gravity.
In the condition of weightlessness the belly and pelvic muscles regress enormously fast and thus remove also the ability to press the child out.
Well well, we go around by birth-introductory aids.
The birth could take place for example also in a special chamber, in order to press the child out.
“However which happens then? ”, the not insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow reads.
On the other hand the child needs likewise artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravitational pull of the earth, the organism can not train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be in the orbit like an adult to training into a load suit.
Simply that will be missing to it, which for its life of elementary importance is.
“This experiment, which we make together, i.e. the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to it that we a handicapped one, perfectly maladjusted humans to the world will bring”, forecasts the director/conductor of the bioethics commission of the institute for medical-biological problems near, Igor Pestow.
So far the birth of children is in the universe bare theory.
It becomes however reality sometime, if the earth inhabitants in their spaceships break open to a far planet, which becomes the home for their descendants born in the universe.

NKÚ boss: Control of the black system fails to the policy by being to blame for
Czech Republic ordered in connection with public contracts over good control instances and adequate laws, drops back however into their application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz this says the vice-president of the highest board of control (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala.
“A law is never perfect, but it must be used correctly - and this is in my opinion with us not the case”, commentates Kala the current situation.
To a similar result apparently also common control comes by Czech and German examiners.
As negative practical example he states the attitude of prime minister Petr Ne čas to the so-called “black system”.
Recently did the prime minister say is the fact that the ODS would not trouble the entrepreneurs with controls - thus now forbidden or permitted the system?
“A law must have its validity nevertheless, and if is somewhat legally forbidden, then nevertheless simply the government chairman cannot come, and in its activity” Kala obstruct, determine the board of control, whose obligation is just control of the adherence to the law.
At the meeting of the committee of control of the chamber of deputies you spoke about a common Czech-German project, within whose framework the laws of both countries were compared with one another concerning public contracts.
About what did it go there concretely?
It concerns thereby a parallel examination, with which we began before approximately two years.
Simplified said, it concerns that the European legislation specifies, how public contracts are to be handled. Whereupon the legislation of the individual nations construct. And finally there is still actual practical application.
We compared all of this with one another, and although the examination is not yet final, we could notice extremely interesting differences. Generally said, the laws are with us some more “more strictly and perfectly”, actual application however are better perhaps even in Germany in some parameters.
Thus it is confirmed that it is not enough to set up new and more exact rules again and again. One must be concerned also with the actual application of the right.
To what extent you can the project be an assistance? What results for you from this project?
Straight such a common control could contribute to the fact that we stop constantly endeavoring us around a perfecting of the laws and the lowering and counterbalancing from thresholds to if this positively does not affect itself apparently particularly.
Economy means to acquire a thing at a reasonable price (which not always the lowest price is) and to exclude illegitimate enrichment or criminal actions.
But the lowering of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps is it even like that we load the system in this way only with excessive “paper stuff”, and those, which look for gaps in the system, it substantially more simply have to use the system as if the thresholds remained higher.
They speak about the problems during the practical conversion of the Czech assignment law.
How does the control system in Germany function?
Does it give here a similar authority as our NKÚ, or does function the system differently?
Which concerns the authorities, then the German counterpart to the NKÚ is the Federal Audit Office, which is just as developed as with us and likewise a council has, who is only somewhat differently educated. In principle both authorities work however similarly.
Also the authority is comparable to a certain measure, whereby Germany is however a Federal State, i.e. that there is these Court of Auditors also in the individual Federal states - in it the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may control only Federal Funds, what corresponds to our national means.
Public means, which are administered with us by the districts and communities, are subject there to control of the state audit offices.
What does the German legislation concern, is simpler than ours?
Generally I would compare this only reluctantly without concrete information. Nontheless Germany is in a way often called model, whereby one cannot however certainly say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because of the fact that the examiners are better there?
That certainly not, but as said: I do not like such comparisons particularly gladly.
For this it is to be still marked that also those countries, which are for us a model have to fight likewise with problems.
Otherwise wouldn't they admit yes nothing from a co-operation with our authority?
What the Czech legislation concerns, which meaning had the amendment of the assignment law for your authority, feels you already any effects?
Considering its that this novella is only short time into force, it does not affect itself it with our examinations so far.
Since our controls later take place, one must count here on a certain delay.
Effects we feel so far rather in the preparatory phase of future controls - in such a way we introduced the new controller “recognition of risks of the inefficiency” and checked and analyzed with this nearly 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will naturally affect ourselves, since the thresholds change, the conditions for certain kinds by advertisements were modified among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or the system with further bureaucracy are loaded?
I think that this law determines a step into the right direction is and hopes that this acceptance is confirmed.
However the problem can occur that the rules become “stricter” and no more not to be kept to be able.
Already under the previous rules an examination the submitted persons are in relation to the carrier (for example, in case of an operational program of the regional policy, the regional advice) to that effect accountable that each disregard of the assignment law of an injury of the household discipline equals.
Is it then however meaningful to make the law still stricter?
In my opinion not in this way.
The system must exclude those, which want to attack and abuse the system, and not those to punish, which committed a formal defect, which does not affect actual decision making.
Such a system sets only the bureaucracy under still larger pressure.
Where here is the way out?
We say first of all, which way is not goal-prominent.
The prime minister said recently the fact that the ODS would not trouble the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called “black system” - which is called that exactly?
Is the black system now forbidden or permitted?
A law must have its validity nevertheless, and if is somewhat legally forbidden, then nevertheless simply the government chairman cannot come, and obstruct the board of control, whose obligation is just control of the adherence to the law, in his activity.
He can say: “We amend the law and permit the thing”, but it cannot say that we do in such a way, as if nothing would be.
The assignment law contains relatively strict rules over the formal execution of certain procedures - and that is also correct for the protection of the public competition.
On the other side it is tragic in addition, if the bidder with the best offer is excluded alone due to formal defects.
The law will be perfect never, but it must be used correctly - and that is what is missing with us in my opinion.

On the roads of Czech Republic partial snow and black ice insists.
The roads are predominant however well passably, every now and then are required increased caution.
Karlsbad
In the district Karlsbad were the roads this morning well passably, isolated prevailed to snow and black ice.
The temperatures sank on -5 to -10 °C, during the day are it to become somewhat warmer.
In the region it does not snow now any longer, and in the deeper altitudes only a thin snowpack remains.
On the combs of the Erzgebirge however about 30 cm snow lie.
According to information limited view prevailed to the district road patrol because of fog.
The motorway R6 and the traffic routes of the first road class in the region are at present without reservation passable.
Attention is however for example required on bridges, on which the lanes are every now and then frozen and smooth.
Passable also all traffic routes of the second and third road class are, including the mountain roads.
On these roads however in sections frozen-over or driven out snow remains remain.
In particular in the higher altitudes is required increased attention from there.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads of East Bohemia danger insists driven out snow layer because of black ice, in higher situations and in the mountains lies on the roads every now and then still another, communicates the road and motorway management on their Internet sites.
The operation centres warn drivers before black ice, which can occur in particular in higher situations in the district Pardubice.
To black ice it can come in particular on traffic routes of the second and third road class in the circles Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 with Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies in particular on the roads in the giant mountains and in the mountains Orlické hory.
A driven out snow layer is appropriate for Kněžnou and Trutnov in altitudes on the roads of the circles Rychnov nad.
In East Bohemia it is today predominantly sunny or cheerful, and it remains to a large extent dry.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blow a weak wind.
District Pilsen
The roads in the district Pilsen are today well passably, locally are however required increased attention, and the driving fashion is to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the freezing point.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures fell afterwards, it can come on the roads to black ice.
In addition local is to be counted on fog, whereby the view will improve however in the course of the day.
These information comes from the district operation centres.
The motorway D5 is practically without reservation passable, increased attention recommends the operation centres however between that to 80. and that 131. Kilometer.
The lanes of the first road class froze completely drying predominantly, however.
In the south of the circles Pilsen and Tachov it can come however in sections to black ice.
The lanes of the second and third road class are damp, and from there the reference to possible frozen-over sections is valid also here.
Drivers should be mainly on the fewer frequented roads in the range Bohemian Forest particularly careful.

In the remaining areas of the district the lanes are usually without reservation passable.
“In the circle Šumperk remain to in the high altitudes still snow remains.
On the passport Červenohorské sedlo must count the drivers toward Jeseník on slush”, said an employee of the road administration department Šumperk today in relation to the agency ČTK.
Also their colleagues in the circle Jeseník had at the night out, according to its information are free and wet the roads into the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the circle Olomouc are without reservation passable the roads, in the circle Šternberk must the drivers however in forest sections carefully drive, since the lanes are still damp here.

In north Bohemia the operation centres announce directly several badly passable road sections.
Beside several places with snow or black ice the mountain roads from Telnice are closed to Knínice in the circle Ústí n.K according to information of the traffic police.
The temperatures remain even in deeper being below zero, so that snow and ice will hold themselves on the roads. From the lowlands, in particular southeast from the Bohemian low mountain range, against it no problems are announced, and the roads are there usually drying.
So far no obstructions of traffic are announced.
Black ice is announced in particular from the periphery by Štětí.
According to Meteoroligists there were ideal conditions for this at the night - during the day to rains and melting snow, in the night of cloudless skies and frost.
By the main routes as well as by the road I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L and bad traffic conditions are announced to Liberec.
The blockage of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary due to branches, which were pressed by the snow load up to the lane.

Šimon Ornest: On our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think of the fact that in less than one month the end of the world is taking place?
That is one of those disaster messages, on which we start humans so gladly.
With our volumes The TAP TAP make we rather about the fact hilariously and say themselves that we are the only volume of the world, which can collect sufficient positive energy, in order to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you in addition a singular project with three concerts realize against the end of the world.
Can you present the project to our readers more near?
This concerns a country-wide benefit meeting, which we plan already two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is prognosticated for 21 December around 11:10 clock in the morning.
On the day before it, i.e. on 20 December, take place starting from 21:00 clock at the same time three of concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is to be in approximately at the time, at which on the Pacific island Kiribati, which lies in a time zone by 12 hours before us, to which Maya calendar ends.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally of me, afterwards we decorated probably the idea common with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
We would like to collect not only sufficiently positive energy, in order to prevent the end of the world, but we would like to think also together with the public about in which condition we transfer this world once to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar we also a singular collection of shoes, T-shirts, and key supporters against the end of the world, developed bags with whose purchase over www.e-tap.cz the people can likewise support us.
The volume The TAP TAP has together with other artists in addition also the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title “end of the world falls out” taken up.
Already today is the hymn on YouTube much likes. Will it ring out also on the charity concerts?
Of course, completely in the end, provided that everything folds and the end of the world does not take place…
The hymn is to be sung by all artists on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition the hymns become together televised live in a direct circuit of the Czech television.
The text of the hymn comes from Tomáš Hanák, which plays also the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, also Xindl X sings with…
How did you come to co-operation with both?
We cooperate even with further personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is connected with the fact that we realize many benefit meetings and concerts…
We strive to merge these people intensively into our projects.
It has itself shown that most are interested in a co-operation with us, and joke to it to have.
Which purpose do proceeds of the concerts benefit against the end of the world?
For the facility of the barrier-free education center Studeo, on which we work already six years as well as the association TAP in the Jedlička institute.
The pupils of the Jedlička institute are cared for regularly by lectors, who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the pupils themselves do not have the means, in order to visit the lectors, we would like to help them in this way.
In contexts of the completion of the Jedlička institute its own building is to develop, into which we draw then with this project.
With each concert several groups and artist arise.
According to which criteria did you select these?
We wanted to arrange a program, which addresses all generations including children.
In Prague for example China ski, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The TAP TAP, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý arises.
You experience all further on the Internet site www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “big events” planned also for the future?
In May we arise for the first time with the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year would like we also gladly in the Czech house in New York to arise, and I personally - if we already in the USA are - would connect this also gladly with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Their foreign plans are not straight small, so far you already in Madrid, Brussels, London or in Moscow arose.
The TAP TAP is however a group, which consists of humans with handicaps.
How do you master these journeys logistically and organizational?
It is not so bad, as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the baggage compartment. In addition we must naturally carry along many instrument suit-cases and other luggage…
Nevertheless it folded ČSA and British Airways without problems, was always very well preparatory for us so far always that I was sometimes partly already surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we recently were, there were no problems.
By your foreign travel you have a comparison, how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, as one with handicapped humans go around there etc.
How did you experience these things so far?
To Madrid, Luxembourg, London and further cities, in which everything works better than with us, we were straight in Russia witnesses its that in the east still everything is in its beginnings.
Opposite Prague Moscow is absolutely not handicapped accessible. There it is still unusual, if someone is in the wheelchair alone in the city centre on the way.
It is not even natural there that one lets in a wheelchair user for example in the elevator.
Fortunately develop also there associations, which try, to refer to the problems of humans with handicaps.
And in which regard we must catch up that opposite far developed countries?
There are still many things, in which we hang afterwards…
In addition it is to be however still marked that an improvement of the situation also always depends on the effort of the concerning.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely usually that also humans with severe disabilities move independently in the public area, into the museum goes, toilets to use can etc.
Is however not straight usual that a larger group of handicapped humans takes part actively there in the social happening, in it are we with the volumes The TAP TAP the west a little ahead!
Respect in the public and accessibility is a thing, but only if from our rows meaning sportsman, artist, actor, politician or attorneys come, the things will really begin to change.
So far these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The TAP TAP is at present very popular. Decrease if we however a few years: What motivated you in the year 1998 to create a volume?
At that time I began as a responsible person in the Jedlička institute, where I met many young people, which were interested to be occupied with somewhat intensive.
And there I musicians am and saxophone play among other things, I together with a colleague an music AG created.
Well, and with the time that, like our moderator, is Láďa Angelovič, to say maintains, somewhat out of control advisablely (laughs).
Became does those admit volume however only in the last years, or errs I?
It is correct that co-operation with well-known singers helped us; in addition we also began to recruit actively for us.
It became conscious to us that, if one carries something out and this outward not to be seen is those does not exist own achievement in certain sense.
Owing to the European Union-aid money we can afford besides good lectors, high-quality devices and etc.
Was it your goal of bringing it with The TAP TAP so far?
From the outset I felt the potential that one can turn on the things differently.
In the show Business today often copies the other one.
That is logical in its way, since all new one with caution is regarded and accepted only after longer time.
There are only few really singular things, and I dare to state that TAP TAP belongs to it.
The first impression, which the spectator has usually, is naturally compassion; that is only natural…
But this compassion is absolutely redundant, because humans with handicaps are not lonely and abandoned natures, which we would have to regret.
There is humans, who can an full life live and develop, if they have the means necessary for it.
I say always that if somewhat succeeds to humans with handicaps, this not only for it a progress am, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, how one of many people hears?
If one liked to make somewhat good, one may a certain discipline in many things no compromises be received and must also call in.
This is in my opinion however completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic conceptions, and if they determine then that they have twice the week sample, preparatory phases to complete must and much time on concert tours spend, then the enthusiasm expires with many fast.
Thus it functions however everywhere, in each volume, which wants to work seriously and reach something.
At present The TAP TAP has twenty members.
How did many of it participate from the outset, i.e. since 1998?
More only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. The people come and go. One cannot prevent that.
Who has the will and which is desire at going through, with us always welcome.
Thursday finds to the 20.12.2012 at 21 o'clock instead of on the day before the prognosticated end of the world,
Places of event are: Incheba arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech of volume and further musicians
All three places of event are connected in the end by live circuit and it ring out with one another a common interpretation of the hymn “end of the world fall out” the volumes The TAP TAP.
A goal of the concert is it to raise the means for the equipment of a multifunktionellen handicapped accessible education center that under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička institute in Prague is to develop. Matter of expense: 25 millions CZK
The entrance costs 400 CZK, children to 12 years free of charge, maps is available in the advance booking with Bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Past week was taken up Poland at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European space agency ESA as a twentieth member of this space authority. Poland is thereby the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after Czech Republic, which became on 12 November 2008 ESA member).
Poland began a close co-operation in the year 1994 with the ESA and took part in the following years at several ESA projects.
The way of Poland into space began certainly much in former times.
Already before the Second World War Polish cosmos-inspired concerned themselves with space, whereby they did not encounter thereby always understanding.
I remind here for example of the lecture of A. Šternfeld from 6 December 1933 in Warsaw observatories, with which the author thought from its pioneer work “entrance on the Kosmonautik” presented.
The ideas of young engineer (born ) the listeners let 1905 however cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered still that Dr. Jan Gadomski interest in its work had only shown.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP deer donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in the year 1934 for “entrance to the Kosmonautik”.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became later an important advocate of the astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines it published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis contribution for the development of space, appreciative world-wide, was appreciated among other things by the fact that one was designated the crater on the earthturned away side of the moon after him.
Already in the year 1925 in Poland a railway hand trolley was built, for which a rocket propulsion was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project remained unfortunately unknown.
It is not clarified even whether the rocket should be used for starting or for braking the hand trolley.
The information for this exclusively originates from the contemporary press.
In the year 1933 the Polish infantry began to be concerned with rocket-claimant projectiles.
Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia led the research work in co-operation with Professor Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the delivered documents it is evident that the research to into the stage of practical tests had penetrated.
The research was then certainly interrupted by the invasion of the German armed forces.
In the year 1937 Rohoziński emerged the draft of a photoelectric hunt rocket coming in the technical literature from engineer, and in the year following on it the work “Rakieta appeared - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza” the author Leliwa Krzywoblocky.
Both projects were concerned with the military use of the rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war all projects were coordinated for the military use of the rocket technology by the passing scientific advisory committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo Naukowy).
The committee was furnished 1937, terminated after two-year activity its work however by the start of the war.
Further articles to space appeared to the Polish space company (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press after the war owing to the work.
The first mention of this society takes place 1954 in the November edition of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to space.
The article of Professor M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to the establishment of a space company.
At the time there were already the first projects to satellite technology, and it was to be foreseen that the study of space would have future.
Already in their beginnings in the year 1956 the Polish space company PTA strove around an entry to the 1951 created international federation for space, and the PTA became actual already in the autumn 1956 tidy member.
In the following year became a first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), deputy chairmen of the international federation for space.
It held this office up to its death in the year 1959.
Since 1956 the PTA took part considerably in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for the scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was finished in the year 1957, the first start took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight altitude of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not completely 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and flight tests began 1959 with the two-stage rocket RM-2 in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed approximately 11.5 kg.
A further development stage should already be able to carry genuine scientific work out - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight altitude of up to 14,5 km and come for the observation from elevator hoists to the employment.
In the year 1962 however the further development was stopped.
Successor of the first rockets of the type RM became in the years 1962 to 1965 the developed meteor 1-ROCKEt.
The rocket was conceived as two-stage rocket, their overall length amounted to 510 cm and the takeoff weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed by this rocket (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A-Rakete had a transport area with 0,4 litres capacity, Meteor-1B over 0,34 litres and Meteor-1C over 0,62 litres.
The maximum flight altitude amounted to with all three types 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 in Luftfahrtinstitut the meteor 2-ROCKEt was developed, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a takeoff weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at a value of approximately 60 km.
Afterwards the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Worth mentioning also the entry of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for space Research) is in the year 1960, after which two years later the establishment of a national COSPAR committee followed.
Poland took part in the context of the intercosmos program also in the space research with Soviet satellites, and in the year 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after the Czech Vladimír Remek a second intercosmonaut.

The abolition of the law over non-profit work is not a solution.
In the past week main header the constitutional court the law over non-profit work up.
This decision caused a lively discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting regard the problem times from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the European Union and in the globalized world are based on the principle of the unregulated economic competition.
Eventually this means that the individual national economies stand with one another in a permanent conflict.
A cause for it is the principle of the free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of the private capital, which go with unrestrained financial speculations hand in hand.
Due to the big differences of the value of work (wages) it comes to price tensions.
By this term a condition is to be understood to exist with the manufacturer tried by import of favorable goods in the economic competition by “undercutting” the competition, in order to actually tear thereby a larger market share and increase its profit.
Generally speaking standard means this for most enterprises to move or buy their production line favorably there abroad to give or however their business up. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.
Since the private capital does not carry social responsibility and concomitantly no responsibility for unemployment caused by it, necessarily the public expenditures rise.
This situation is strengthened still by the fact to replace that the Mr. Unternehmer are absolutely indignant to pay their taxes and by it the totalsocial economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well-known, so that concrete statistics are here redundant.
The inconsiderate practice of the private capital creates a situation, in which the governments see themselves in a forced manner to step in competition with one another in the individual national economies in order the social level of the own population artificially to lower and with it foreign capital in the country to lure.
In other words: The governments deliver the own population without consideration for the social consequences the private capital.
This expresses itself in particular in changes of valid laws.
A goal of these measures is it to force the own population to accept the dictation of the private capital in particular within the wage range.
This is done on the one hand via economic obligation with long-term unemployment, on the other hand with cutting the employment rights.
The result are always increasing poverty, as well as big differences between arm and realm.
In Germany there are already public food distribution offices for arms, which are not any more able for some years, to nourish itself by own work.
The number of concerning goes already into the millions.
In the course of the increase of the competitive power of the German economy it comes regularly to cases, in which employees receive such a small wages that the state must supplement their income up to the subsistence level.
A such scandal also uncovered in case of in the German Bundestag employed auxiliary workers.
The economy measures practically all European Union-Southern States will certainly come down to the same condition, with which humans under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level are compelling, to emigrate (like it in 19. Century the case was) to starve or for a pittance at the edge of the society and hope for the fact that private investment capital will flow sometime into the country.
Here naturally does the question force itself upon, from where this capital comes?
If it comes from another EU country, only the poverty walks from a country in the other one; or the capital is missing equal whole, because in China, India, Brazil, in Turkey, in Morocco or Egypt and/or in Africa at all works the persons employed for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns completely Latin America.
Liberals theories and media state up to the weariness that the state with capital in his own national economy it did not take part may and that planned economy leads to the economic disaster.
The private capital persists narrow-mindedly in its point of view that the state may not intervene steering in the economy.
Then one must ask oneself however whether not the private capital affects the policy and with it the entire state in the own egoistic sense or directs.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The proof for it is the existence of a practically all-powerful and lobby pervasive in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the range of the corruption, which mutual giving preference to, a legislation, in which practically everything is punishable culpably, but nothing.
In Germany is the situation like that a Department of State assigns private, closely right enterprises intertwined with the industry for lack of finances the elaboration of bills.
These bills are adopted afterwards in the Bundestag.
All force does not proceed then any longer from the people, as the western conditions announce it, but of strong banking syndicates, which prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberals democracies come at present fast into a situation, as them describe Appian in its work for the crisis of the Roman republic at times of Caesar and Pompeius': “The state was already for a long time in the decay understood, and the offices were occupied with force.
Against bribe, by illegal obtaining by devious means of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption rampantly grew unrestrainedly, and the people did not go to humans with a character with voting already bought to the choice”… “applied for offices, so that the state had no consul due to this fall eight months long”… “one began already really about the fact to speak that the only medicine was in this heavy situation an autocracy, and that a strong man must be selected”… Appian thought thereby of Pompeius, but the strong man was then final Caesar, which replaced the democracy permanently by the autocracy.
As is it shown, the today's society is based just like in the antiquity on the inconsiderate preference of the own advantage, without respecting on totalsocial interests.
The private capital is not already from its nature able to recognize and implement the advantage for the entire society.
The result, today like at that time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elite, which does not strive in the slightest for reforms in greater depth.
The cause for arising fascism and communism we must from there in the inconsiderate liberalisation of the economic systems in 19. and 20. Century look for.
Seen from the today's condition, the fall of these regimes can be regarded in favor of liberals democracies as certain break, with which the next round already appears.
Particularly catastrophically is fact that the today's elite in the future possible losses of hundred thousands of human lives, which for humanitarian and social disasters, a whose witness we stand already today is, as well as the crimes against the humanity, how we know them from older and newer history, in perfect ignorance opposite.
The abolition of the law over non-profit work is here no solution, at least no permanent.
Under the pressure of the global and European economic competition Czech Republic will be compelling to look for also further ways in order to press the social level of the population downward.
This trend is system-dependent from there.
The only solution are purposeful political-social reforms, which increase the financial participation of the state at the economy, which increase influence of the citizens to the government and which in favor of the state weaken monopolistic position of the private capital in the society.

Israel: Laboratory of the chaos.
“… the fact that nothing develops from force or ever could develop” sings for Sting in the song fragile one, whose most important verse in the refrain reads: “… with it we forgotten, we are not as fragile”.
“If my sons no wars wanted, would give it none”, say the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1849
After the last wave of the force between Israel and the Gaza Strip there, like always, was an immense number of reactions.
The one stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others again support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed at the Palestinian Arabs and designate the State of Israel than of terror.
I would here not like to write over it, who in these recurring waves of killing guilty and who victim is; finally the today's inhabitants of Israel including the autonomy areas were in-born into the present political situation and were not experienced the beginning of the force.
It concerns to me the view to open to the readers behind the scenes the view of it, the 95 years tension (counted starting from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) in small marks the country in the Near East are above all helpful to whom.
My thoughts rely on accessible historical facts, others are derived partly from these and come out from my own understanding of it, who and/or which group affects the events of modern history of humans considerably.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the fight for power.
In each epoch we can constitute a Alexander the large one or a Napoleon.
What it is less apparent is the question, whether these personalities were really always, their step autonomously determined, or whether behind their throne someone stood, which directed its acts on a pre-determined goal.
We must admit ourselves that we live in a time, in which itself the wealth of the world in the hand less particulars concentrated, and that this concentration of the money and power coming out from it did not develop within the life-span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families one particularly stands out, which one could head of the Kraken call (I white, whether over them still someone stands, I did not close this however not out) - the Rothschilds.
Much is not written over it.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) became already of the Rothschilds in the 90's the 19. Century bought, in order to prevent the connection of their name also high-criminal acts, in their background always the consolidation of their power, which stood for increase of its fortune or both.
The Rothschilds is involved in nearly all central banks of the world, and against the countries, in which they are not involved in the central banks, they lead wars or prepare on these (before the assault on Afghanistan there was 7 countries, after the assault on Iraq was it 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, whereby Russia subordinated in the meantime its central bank of the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with the life for it.
Abraham Lincoln rejected it to renew the status of Rothschilds bank OF America as central bank began during the civil war, own (speak: national) notes to give change and 1865 in a theatre were murdered.
J.F. Kennedy began to publish own notes and wanted the FED to abolish - he was murdered 1963; the delegate Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned 1936, after he wanted to sue the FED because of release of the world economic crisis in the year 1929.
The global power longing of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan to provoking of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason the 33. and thus highest degree of the realization.
The first war had the goal to eliminate the large monarchistic state natures of Europe by which second war should in particular colonial rule of Great Britain are broken, and which third war is the world population on approximately 0.5 - finally 1 billion humans reduce (such a number would provide for its conveniences and its luxury and so many resources would also not use), a universal religion create (the ecumenism is here nothing else as the apron) and to the assumption of absolute power to lead.
The method, with which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds works on the point, is the release of a crisis and the following offer of a solution (order off chao - order from the chaos).
These solutions are however wrong and always lead to the aggravation of the situation (see establishment of the FED, thereby to crises as the released by them in the year 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they had succeeded by the murder at the Habsburg successor to the throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo to release the First World War they destroyed the Russian tsar realm by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended to economically unfounded surrender of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian tsar realm the war was no longer necessary) with the sudden, militarily and, afterwards took place the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria Hungary.
In order to be able to kindle the Second World War more simply, the bankers let a latent conflict situation create by the policy, by occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations; thus they created the condition of impoverished masses, so that they had palm off the German only a sufficiently strong leader, that offered the guilty ones designated and simple solutions; a further factor was the creation of the multiracial state Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth column and also took, in order to kindle the war fire.
End the 19. Century initiated the Rothschilds the establishment of the Zionistic movement, with which a branch aimed at the establishment of a Jew state, if possible in the historical area of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return after Zion).
The Balfour declaration already mentioned created the condition for the mass immigration from Jews to Palestine; it came to first collisions with the residents Arab population.
There were attacks of terror on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether now Hitler of the chain tore away itself, at which the international bankers had kept it initial, or whether everything ran after plan, it is only difficult to measure, in any case created the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps the condition for the acknowledgment of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was created in the year 1948, and prepared just like through the war reparations against Germany the ground for the Second World War, represents proclaiming the State of Israel the creation of the focus for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will succeed to provoke this war the Jewish people becomes similar as this time in the Second World War the victim in the foremost combat line, together with the Arab and/or Muslim population of the Near East.
Israel is international like an enormous laboratory, a source of the controversy and the chaos, not only in the country, but also (one remembers only, like humans into supporters and opponents of Israel are divided sharply).
Who is guilty ones and who the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice releases only injustice in an endless spiral of the force, how at the beginning the greed of particulars and their striving for global power it stood?
One must between the inhabitants of Israel and its guidance differentiate here, sets nevertheless the international bankers in Israel just like with us, the people, excluding their own candidates to the choice.
The present prime minister Israels, the falcon Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascism-susceptible, the international bankers loyally devoted politician, who does everything in order to kindle a war with the Iran, of which itself in view of the membership Iran in the Schanghaier organization for co-operation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan…), rapidly to a global conflict to expand could, and with that it because of control of Iran of the only 2-mile-wide road of Hormus, over which 20% of the world-wide oil supplies run, to a destruction of the world economy to come could.
In which light there the words appear David Rockefellers from the year 1994: “The only one, which we need, is all a re-clamping crisis, and humans will welcome the new world order.”
In its conception the new world order is a world of the gentlemen and slaves.
A world, in which the rest serves the human population of a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world, in which each newborn child with the birth a chip is implanted, in order to subject this nature of total control.
“And it makes that the small ones and the large ones, the realms and the arms, give themselves the free ones and the farmhands all together the malt oaks to their right hand or to their forehead that nobody can buy or sell, it have the malt oaks, i.e. the names of the animal or the number of its name.
Here is wisdom! Who has understanding, consider the number of the animal.
Because it is humans number, and its number is six hundred sixty-six.”

The film Argo: If it stands most badly, Hollywood call
In November 1979 a mobilization of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the US-American message in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as a hostage.
For their release they demanded the distribution of the fallen shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled after the revolution into the USA, which had protected the patronage over decades over its regime.
For the American government there was no positive way out of this situation - she could not afford it to throw the shah over board since this would have damaged the confidence of her allied ones in other countries substantial.
It was not simultaneous in the situation, in Iran, where the revolution flowed into the installation of a theocratic regime, the release of the hostages to implement.
It was a heavy impact for the call of the United States, and the following fiasco with the attempt by force of the freeing of hostages made only worse all.
The imprisoned taken diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations had been obtained by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages caused at home a wave of the solidarity as well as anti-Iranian tendencies.
The debacle in Iran contributed substantially to the defeat Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan with the presidential elections in the year 1980.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history, which gave a small partial victory to the USA.
Directly before occupation to six message employees the escape succeeded to the message.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
It succeeded to the CIA in co-operation with the Canadian authorities to bring the refugees from Iran; extravagant story helped them for covering their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports camouflaged as members of a film staff, that visited turning places for a science fiction film allegedly in the country.
Combination that of category
Of the expert for “Exfiltration”, Tony Mendez, developed plan made also co-operation Hollywoods necessary.
So that the camouflage became reliable, articles appeared over this film project in technical periodicals, it press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a material office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film relies on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks film is a special combination several film category.
On the one side it is simultaneous in addition, a so-called “Caper Movie”, i.e. the history of a successful piece of Hussar as for example a realistic political thriller, the film Ocean's Eleven.
Thus the tendency levels off change themselves on the one side the documentary scenes from Tehran in the film (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographies are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other side the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and easily exaggerated from there.
And then there are still the scenes from the CIA center and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the office corridors, at the telephone…
Ben Affleck succeeded to its career with this film a remarkable restart.
From a smiled at actor respectable director became, and also as actors it is now no more the goal of ironical notes.
Argo is not its third feature after the crime film children's game (Gone baby of Gone, 2007) and the thriller city without grace (2010).
It is simultaneous Afflecks first film, which does not play in the native Boston of the director.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place belonged thereby to the characteristics which took the previous films off of this director from the standard Hollywoods.
Affleck proves this feeling however also in Argo, where Tehran of Canada becomes “played”.
The best scenes of the film play in the roads and show the reconstruction of events, which really took place - the entrance sequence of the storming of the message is in its clarity very impressing, and mediated thereby nevertheless the feeling of confusion and the unpredictability, which enters, if history moves somewhere.
A similar effect obtains Affleck with its team also with fictitious scenes (the wrong film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action at too many places
The director had to argue also with the fact that history does not offer actually many scenes stretching in the cinematic sense.
With the few he however quite successfully works, whereby sometimes he helps the reality somewhat - which does not work then always so elegantly (the scenes, in which the threatening crisis on the airport is turned away in Tehran from a telephone call in America, or also the pursuit on the runway, work somewhat affectedly).
The weakness of Argo is its all too broad dispersion, which is due to the necessity to have to show too much at action at too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in her roles as Hollywood employees, their figures however more area would have earned, and thus they are not located in the film by far alone.
Afflecks film loses thereby something at traction power. It is a film, which one pursues with certain interest and the organization and to a thriller from the 70. Years reminding Retro style to appreciate knows.
It wakes enthusiasm however only heavily.
As memory of up to today in certain way alive piece of history and as proof its, as covered nevertheless the conceptions of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, it is however sufficient.

Guidelines for blowing up ballons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which proclaims annually a survey over the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organize the competition “most absurd regulation and/or idea from the European Union-workshop”.
“On this idea us the plan brought forward recently by the European Union brought to introduce a woman ratio of 40% in the management of large European companies”, said Patrik Nacher, who worries about the organization of this survey, opposite the newspaper to Právo.
Under the nominated absurdities for example the judgement of the European Court of Justice is over the standardization of insurance rates for men and women.
By then women enjoyed an advantage with life insurances, because they represent a smaller risk for the insurance companies objectively.
“Further ones unbelievable ideas from the European Union-workshop can be nominated until the end of this year.
The actual vote effected then to at the end of February 2013”, communicated Nacher.
To the controversies among other things the obligatory admixture from bio ethanol belongs to EU regulations to fuels, which is nature-damaging in its consequence, the further prohibition of the reliable mercury thermometers, only because these contain a relative to small quantity of this danger material, or also the guideline the size of chicken cages, therefore in this year eggs became substantially more expensive.
Criticism harvested the actual prohibition of the use of the term “butter upstroke” or also the sales ban for conventional bulbs in the past also.
Bananas must be long 14 cm
The European union-apparatus decides to be usually represented often under the pressure of these or that lobby from trade and industry, their demands in Brussels of one or more member countries (thus Czech Republic tries at present for example to implement also with veto threat the demands of Czech banks).
Interests of lobby stood also behind the fact that bananas of the highest grade in the European Union at least 14 cm to be long to have and no “anomaly of curvature” to exhibit be allowed.
The European commission defended itself with the fact with the argument that it harmonizes only the non-uniform standards of the individual nations, which would obstruct the trade.
The standards concerning fruit and vegetable were already macerated by the European Union against the resistance of some countries with the reference that the past guidelines would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey is possibly the EU regulation from the past year, which in accordance with ballons with the sale with the reference it will provide must that children may not blow the ballon up under eight years without supervision of an adult.
The European Union referred thereby to an American study, which is in accordance with ballons the prominent cause with the asphyxiation death of children.
A similar restriction is valid already for children to 14 year with the use of Jahrmarktströten.
There are strange ideas also at home
Relatively absurdly is also a guideline, which concerns the European officials - everyone, which takes an official function in the European Union, may use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the topic for Greece not and must instead FYROM (molder Yugoslav Republic OF Macedonia) to say.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com of liberal economist Laissez fair one apart from the above mentioned absurdities nominated also the EU regulation over the extent of food supplies in the area of a member country in co-operation with the federation.
The European Union specified thereby the maximum volume at food supplies, which could be on the day of our EU accession in the area of the Czech republic.
Czech Republic then e.g. exceeded the fixed volume for mushroom tinned food, for which a high fine threatened us.
The organizers of the survey were impressive also of the idea that certain countries should receive money for it that they do not have a sea, or however of the idea to give aid money for requests for aid money.
These ideas originated certainly not from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will request, explained refund at the European Union” in the autumn 2004 the Secretary of Agriculture at that time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
As argument he stated that grain harvest had been very high and the national camps were overcrowded due to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czech Republic has a further way to seas port, the European Union should pay according to Palas hundreds millions euros at us.
The European commission came to meet Czech Republic finally so far that it organized an advertisement over the purchase of grain from countries, which do not have an entrance to the sea.
The Ministry for regional development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU) offered aid money for requests for aid money to the communities, concretely should it thereby means for taking up of aid money requests at Brussels concern.
European Union: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations in the member countries easily to the target of the criticism, the efforts of the European Union around adjustment and concomitantly around effectiveness and development of the entire European union earned according to opinion of some experts however rather acknowledgment.
A more serious problem are according to opinion of these experts rather the European Union-aid money for projects, which do not have purely nothing at all together with the recess of the European integration, which were forced however with the household negotiations by individual member countries.
In this country also the fact causes emotions that Czech Republic must fight similarly as other member countries in Brussels for the right to use of specific designations of traditional products and this fight thereby always does not win.
Czech Republic could defend after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria the designation “Olomoucké tvarůžky”, the resident rum (Tuzemský rum), its tradition with us in 19. Century goes back, had to rename our manufacturers however in “Tuzemák”.
The designation rum may be used only for products of sugar tubing distillate, not for products of sugar beets.
In the official list of the products registered in the European Union emerge in the society world-famous cheese places feta cheese and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker of marzipan or the Parmaschinkens now also that Carlsbad rusk, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer the hop.
About a European Union-mark the Pardubicer gingerbread or the Hořicer roles can gloat there.

“The people want that I save the republic, but I am only an amateur”, maintain Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how one comes on the idea to stand as a candidate for the office of the president?
It does not concern to me to be senator or president.
If in our country everything would function without problems, I would not stand as a candidate anywhere.
But I cannot regard no more also, how the republic is pillaged for 20 years, as thieves run around freely, while humans the taxes and the pensionable age are increased.
I did not have ambitions to become politicians.
If I see however something, to change what does not please me, then I try a solution to suggest, in order this.
And there I over 40 am independent and non-party already, and in addition to stand as a candidate have I no other possibility of affecting the things than for the office of a senator or the president.
Into the senate you created it and on the way into the castle made yourselves then alike.
Don't you turn thereby your voters the back?
I said myself the whole time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of the senatorial elections.
Later I specified and said that I will stand as a candidate for the office of the president, if I am selected to the senator.
My goal is however not the function. The function is an instrument, with which I mean visions realize can.
But I need as much as possible influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The difficulty does not consist however only of the fact that we grumble as a people in the tavern and before the television, but everyone annihilate, which wants to change something.
In addition come the media, which want to rob the honour, and which the freedom of the word with the freedom confound to lie.
Over me it was for example maintained that I would captivate journalists or that I was an advisor of Jiří Paroubek.
We speak about your visions.
You took up the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive fortune explanations over 20 million crowns.
In addition you must change for law.
When you do not have president in this regard authority, and only the senate can bring in as a whole parliamentary bills.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When simple citizen has I for the fact used that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be implemented.
The problem is the smallmental policy - if someone from right or from left with a good proposal comes, these is intentionally rejected, and the population only stops.
As independent non-party have I a by far larger potential to win support at all parties represented in the parliament.
My advantage consists of the fact that I can take myself that without pigeonhole thinkings and party dogmas of each party, which for our country the best is.
Do you see yourselves as humans in the policy rather on the right of or left?
From Czech view it seems to me that the people see me rather left.
For me this right left thinking is however completely unimportant.
For me it is important that we get ahead.
It does not concern to me whether someone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I would like to connect humans.
Always I support publicly each good solution, even if this of the KSČM or of the ODS comes, and likewise I against bad ideas will turn.
It displeases you, if someone calls you populist.
But you do not confirm that thereby, which you said straight?
If you set up a Business plan in a company, then you have also an ideal goal and a vision.
And you would like to approach this.
One can call this on my account populism, but all proposals, of which I spoke, function in the world already, or they were discussed by important experts.
But without support in the parliament only key words remain for you.
And thus you come in the policy on a long-term basis not far.
Or do you mean that you, if you talk only for a long time enough with the people will succeed, to implement for example the material and criminal liability?
I do not have other possibility.
Politician to convince and try journalists and the public to bring it on our side in order to implement these goals.
As a president it would not be for me a problem to request the chairmen of the parliament parties live on TV in addition the material and criminal liability for politician, an official, to anchor judges and state lawyers legally.
And the responding would have to then say if necessary, why them this to reject.
A strong personality, that refers to drawbacks, can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct choice of the president, who was a earnings of the public pressure.
I say completely clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try, allied for my opinions and visions to find.
With the policy I began just and try to find for my program the support of the majority.
I always try to judge the things themselves; and if it does not fold, then I decrease in six years again into the private sector.
That sounds little, as if Okamura Czech Republic should save.
I am not a rescuer.
I know that I reach alone nothing; therefore I spoke with several well-known personalities about whether they would like to stand as a candidate not also for the senate.
I spoke e.g. with Radim Jančura, which rejected however because of overwork.
In addition I supported the investigative lady journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud with the trade with light fuel oil.
My candidacy began myself I with the condition that humans are deeply dissatisfied, but am no longer safe I now.
At all to the elections did not go to sixty percent of the voters, and those, which went, selected usually representatives of the establishment.
In the senate we are only two independent ones thereby.
The people selected such a senate composition that changes will be only very with difficulty achievable.
Nevertheless I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district captains.
Do you think about the establishment of their own party?
About it I did not think yet, because I do not have time to examine the past of each potential party member and also not at all the money for it has.
I do not have yet times money for the president campaign; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
They do not have money?
They speak of fortune explanations, how their would look?
I estimate my private possession on approximately 60 millions CZK.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 million, a apartment for approximately 10 million, a further for 8 million, an art collection, which are worth about 10 million, as well as an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb, which is worth about one million. And then I have still a few millions on the account.
Aston Martin was by the way a child dream - James Bond always pleased me, how he drove in the car, was gallant to women and fought at the same time against the bad.
They do not drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and to have money for your campaign?
They say that you want to change the republic, but you would not like to invest your own money in it.
That is not convincing straight.
I do not have a 15 million for the campaign.
Am I to make debts?
I put already 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I do not have sponsors, shows that my program arouses probably not all too much interest.
And I am not obligated to deny the campaign from own means.
The costs of the campaign are covered strictly speaking by my content as a senator.
But of the senator content alone I could not live; so I e.g. my son would not know the English school financiers, whom costs 30,000 per month.
If I wanted to make only money, I would not stand as a candidate for nothing at all.
Do you remain thus active as entrepreneurs further, in order to have your getting along?
Didn't you say that you will go back these activities?
But is not connected with the height of the content.
As promised, has I mean activities partly gone back.
Thus my deputy becomes e.g. in the spring a managing director of the travel agency.
The people want to see me as Samaritan, who saves the republic.
But I must live nevertheless also on something.
To which monthly income were you accustomed as entrepreneurs?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that is also further like that.
As a president will I mean enterprises however completely to stop.
You find the complete discussion in the Saturday edition of Právo.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the head - by the example of Spijkenisse and the recently established book mountain - 2 photos
“I find the building hilariously, it look futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again”, says Lisette Verhaig, a Passantin at the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT-Technician in an nearby large-scale enterprise, means: “, Nevertheless beautifully it is already, the house.”
But I ask myself, for which we need still today another library.
All have Internet, iPad and E-Books.
No humans go still today voluntarily into one of these old style libraries, or?
Spijkenisse, a hardly inspection-needy dormitory suburb before the gates of Rotterdam, is strange record holder.
The 80.000-Einwohner-Gemeinde exhibits the lowest education council of the entire Netherlands.
In order to work against this stupid circumstance, one decided some years ago to contribute to the general education and the seven fictitious bridges, which are represented on the euro lights, to copy as pretty brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive held itself within limits.
And in such a way the city fathers that there would be only one possibility, recognized the statistics gentleman to become: A library must ago!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdamer architect's office MVRDV, master of the daring bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the thing with used to leaving and appeared to competition hearing in the year 2003 with five books under to arm and grinning in the face.
And during the jury still startled around itself looked and with the shoulders twitched, stacked the impudent Maas its exquisite souvenirs of the size after too a pyramid and terminated its actionistic supported speech with the words: “Love municipality!”
That is it thus, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Later the 30 million euros expensive mountain is heaped up nine years.
It is part of a revitalization project, to which also to underground parking, to supermarket, and a few adjacent apartment and terraced houses with altogether 50 apartments belong to post office.
At the beginning of November was distinguished the book mountain with the second price “Best LIBRARY OF NL 2012”.
In addition the project for the Dutch is national Wood Award 2012 nominated.
Thus is faceless town retort, which did not have to offer to date no more than a postmodern pedestrian precinct and a speechless ugly city hall, behind whose white fronts one would be bent to assume a dairy factory around a piece of contemporary architecture enrich.
Above all however Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural's building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Büchereldorado under cheese cover.
There is an elevator, which leads in the middle by the mountain massif, but the true space and read joys are opened when fußläufigen ascending topography.
The all around glassed interior is bright and clear, the burned clinker ground and elegant street lights speaks unmistakably the language of a public city place.
The urban ambience is perfect.
One already looks out for park bench, dog and football playing boy and girl.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Normally the bookshelves stand along the front, and in the center lies a large, dark area, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal”, says Winy Maas.
We placed the classical space configuration on the head and inverted the read range from the inside outward.
The inside of the book mountain is skillfully used: In the center lie offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and building services center.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are times wall lining, times parapet wall, times staircase railings.
Optics, surface feel and smell are strange.
Even confirmed architects and civil engineers shake whether the unknown building material the head.
“We wanted to work here with recycling materials”, explain Joop Trouborst, Projektleiter at the municipality Spijkenisse, on request the standard.
And like that we are discovered in a friesländischen agrarian enterprise of one day a suitable waste product from the agriculture.
For many years one uses a millimeter-thin plastic fleece in the Netherlands in greenhouses and on fields as root document.
That is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile keeps, two Saisonen, afterwards it is ripe for the skip refuse.
For the library the fleece was pressed - for the first time in this quantity to four centimeters thick plates.
Under heat effect and pressure the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) discolours to a dark, homogeneous, strong material, which smells a little after new vehicles and a little after sport shoe.
After 105 stages one arrived at the summit.
In the end that nearly 500 meters are not only enough for journey become one in the literature café with a fantastic prospect on the city, but also with Dutch Kroketten and potted Ficusbäumen rewards.
They provide for atmosphere, above all however for the correct air humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the new soul
“One would not believe it, but this house is despite the many glass areas a presentation project in terms of ecology”, says Trouborst.
One heats and one cools with terrestrial heat.
Although the book mountain stands under a glass fall, the sun shines only short on sunny days in the inside.
The broad glued timber girders, which serve transverse to the glass facade, as shadowing and intercept a majority of the sun exposure.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Fully automatic of Rollos settle the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT-industry, already dared the way into the new library.
Already there also Lisette Verhaig was.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Boekenberg Spijkenisses “for a long time overdue soul”.
The reason: To the opening few weeks ago each inhabitant was invited to donate a book from its personal existence.
With it for the time being once the optical gaps in the not yet completely equipped library - at present 70,000 pieces - are to be filled.
The concept is come up.
The shelves are filled to above.
“Nothing is worse than an halfempty library”, says architect Winy Maas.
“I think, owing to our invitation have now each inhabitant a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that its book is part of this building.
And if it is only to the Zierde.
Thus MVRDV that king discipline succeeded, which one calls in the jargon identity foundation.
Spijkenisse wrote history of literature.
So young and uneducated it to also be likes.
That is finally times a starting point for identity.

Szabo: “Germans must play larger role”
Germany contained in the vote over the admission of Palestine of the voice.
According to Stephen Szabo, Experte for US-European relations, balances Berlin thereby on a narrow diplomatic degree.
German wave: Beginning of the week had first signaled Germany that it would be correct against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
Then however Berlin contained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany supports what the Israelis did in Gaza, not.
Now Germany must be however careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But I believe at the same time that it does not support also the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - opposite Israel to be without however too critical.
During the rebellion in Libya in March 2011 Germany likewise contained of the voice, when it concerned to furnish a no-fly zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Does it fall Germany heavily to refer with important international topics a clear position?
Yes, which is correct.
That is because of the fact that it changes straight its foreign policy over away from a policy, which became as it were from the USA gemanaged to a German foreign policy.
Aggravatingly it is added that the Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans are thus between the fronts.
One expected of them that they play a more independent role, to it is however not accustomed it.
I believe, her still approach themselves to her role, but they are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Great Britain.
What means a “normal” foreign policy concretely from German view?
It shows the readiness to refer with national interests also positions those is independent from those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, thus from the exports and its relations to certain regions, about Russia, China or the Near East.
Of Germany economic interests are to a certain degree different than those the other large would like and therefore must Germany its interests to protect.
Did these economic interests have influence on the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand Germany has large sales markets in the Near East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore it must be careful, the public, in addition, the elite not to push in the Arab countries before the head.
That plays in any case a role.
But I would want to attach also not too much weight to that, that am no completely one-sided relationship.
But it plays in any case an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the USA, by containing with important decisions of the voice, with the vote over Palestine?
I believe, in Europe and even in the USA prevail large understanding for the German position.
Therefore I do not believe that this was a so dramatic break, as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany thereby will get into practice even a certain respect.
Because it signals nevertheless that as international players it is seriously taken and its interests to be considered to have.
There are different opinions in Europe to the Palestinian initiative.
The USA against it expressed themselves clearly for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the USA and many European nations?
Due to the American home policy these differences always existed.
I believe that the government among Obama has secretly probably a good deal understanding for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government can not represent this position publicly naturally.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not at all so large, as they always appear.
If you regard the relations between Obama and Premierminister Netanjahu, then Obama is not at all like that enthusiastically from Netanyahu's politics.
Does it fall Germany heavily, its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one to agree and the position of the most important partners in the European Union on the other side?
I believe, exactly make it so difficult for the Germans.
It would be naturally a little more simply for the Germans, if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, what at present not the case is.
Thus they cannot to be part of a broader line and have instead things from their own position to advance.
They make that straight with the euro.
I believe, in the future Germany a prominent role will take over, to Europe to a European position to urge.
That is naturally not simply for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
That was always already a sensitive topic.
But I believe that the Germans it is clear that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role as an important international player - does Germany want to take over at all a leading role?
Or does Germany the guiding role fall still heavily?
Germany is not accustomed yet to it, that is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, falls it the country still heavily, a larger role to play.
If we look at ourselves for example the euro crisis, there each mark, if Germany accepts a larger role, becomes most diverse anti-German feelings freely.
That does not make it simple for the Germans.
That is actually the old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is so seen in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be sensitive to most diverse neighbours and opinions and that is not simple.
Now does the influence of the USA in the European policy decrease continuously, the European Union fills for the moment this vacuum however not, who remains there otherwise?
The Germans will have to play simply a larger role.
Even if it does not please them, it them is unpleasant and it makes still many more unpopular - la vie c'est!

“Trademark protection” in China: If Puma and Armani become suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-well-known mark, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise.
What however is Armani Polo?
Behind it hides itself a designation completely officially registered in China, which has to do however nothing with the origin enterprises.
It enjoys so long protection nevertheless, as the actual name givers do not complain.
And even then it is not clear whether they get right.
“It will for foreigners ever more with difficulty to protect their marks in China”, says Thomas Pattloch, Anwalt in the chancellery Taylor Wessing, who is specialized in patent right injuries in the Far East.
Each week lands a new case on my desk.
Already a few additional letter is enough to the imitators, so that they may announce their marks.
Thus will from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada lets one Prada Kny register.
Also German enterprises are in this way legally copied, for instance manufacturer of sports equipment Puma.
Stalemate hole opens a folder with entries of the office for mark in Peking.
On 14 September 2010 there a Chinese enterprise let the registered trade mark Zegna DF Puma protect, an art name, which availed itself also with the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in the injured one of mental property is well-known.
In the large cities there are more-floor department stores, which sell almost exclusively falsifications.
Stalemate hole cases however are different: On behalf its mandators it proceeds against the fact that Chinese enterprises receive the right from the office for mark completely officially to use a designation which is already elsewhere protected.
The Chinese call “fear for Mingpai”, a front seat passenger mark.
The word orients itself on “fears for DAK SCN”.
Thereby women are meant who fish themselves rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of a debt
“Is business-damaging that, one must it fight”, demands stalemate hole.
“The mark is watered, the all attitude disappears, the image damage is enormous.”
The financial losses and the legal costs of the industries concerned go into the millions, particularly with expensive presentation products.
According to the market study company CLSA is China with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year the third biggest market for luxury items and the fastest growing.
But deletions of dubious entries in the register of trademarks are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine the procedure can drag on years, with uncertain exit.
Stalemate hole reports of cases, in which the court rejected complaints, because after the long duration the complained of name had become the “market reality”.
If the plaintiff has pitch, he must pay to the plagiarist even money, because he injured its mark in China, says stalemate hole.
Sometimes here the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases concern also graphic elements.
2009 lost Daimler a law case with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, that enterprise, which recently the Germans concrete pump farmer finery master took over.
The Chinese may use therefore to today a emblem, which resembles the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo, which reminded of BMW; the controversy was conciliation, Geely had to change it.
The mode manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, which let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of a debt.
The office for mark CTMO in Peking admits that it gave 2010 there because of too small personal and space equipment of bottlenecks.
Last year one returned however from the “emergency situation in the workflow to normality”.
Thus the existence of rough opposition procedures sank by 22 percent.
One locked nearly 57,000 of such cases, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Still 81,500 objections wait nevertheless for completion in the office.
On the other hand to concern much costs
Like so often in China the numbers are impressing.
Last year were received with the CTMO more as 1.4 million requests for trademark protection, nearly a third more than 2010.
That is a record and means that China would start the list of the new applications in all world one behind the other for the tenth time, communicates the authority.
That is valid also for the existence of all valid brand names, altogether 5.5 million pieces.
2011 was taken 1.8 billion Yuan at fees.
Simplified that means that each registration on average costs 1280 Yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand to concern a multiple costs, as the case of the German exempt private company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years the company fights against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans could reach that its illegal production of imitated motor vehicle parts was dug.
But the imitator secured itself further the Chinese rights at the mark Freudenberg.
One has missed, since in Germany surnames could not be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical specialities in Munich.
The office for mark CTMO also rejected the objection of the Munich.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got quite, but the litigants continue to fight until today.
One must watch out infernally
Now the affair before highest Gerichtshof is pending.
Wentzler is confident to bring the thing to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But it says also: “The procedure is extremely complex and costs us much time, money and nerves.”
The internal costs let themselves hardly number, had the company archives even one hundred years old documents to examine, in order to furnish proofs.
Before five years Freudenberg offered in vain a “high six-digit amount of euro” to the opposite side for the settlement.
“To it one sees, like much us that is worth”, says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten to back-slosh even to Europe.
If Imitatoren secure themselves unprotected marks there.
So a Chinese manufacturer wanted to announce the name Freudenberg for shoes and leathers in Germany.
This trading area gave up the company for a long time, nevertheless could turn it the registration away.
“One must watch out infernally”, says Wentzler.
Both it and the lawyer stalemate hole guess/advise German enterprises to be very careful with business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark laws on the contrary the foreigners of “everything that somehow worth of protection is, should also in China announce”, as Wentzler says.
Otherwise that can become many more expensive than the registration.
Indeed: If Freudenberg in the last act of its mark drama is subject, then one would have to probably pay the opposite side royalties for the own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed in the questionable segment from the market.

World AIDS day: Stamp, sing, help
In Heidelberg the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are pleased about it.
The history of a connection, which overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First is there stamping: Cowboy boots, basketball shoes, lady pumps and gentleman slip by look for the beat on the parquet flooring, find it fast.
Unity two three four.
Only then the voices of the singers swell slowly to on alto, bass, tenor and treble - press, beguile and pursue themselves.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year old conductor, lifts it nearly from its material shoes, if he unites her with his supply wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music area of the institute for medical psychology in Heidelberg rehearses the choir Imbongi a new song.
To the fifty singers and singer came, between 23 and 69 years old, of the Humangenetikerin up to Hausmann.
“Om'Obani” is not a simple piece, each choir voice has another text and this also still in a very foreign language: Zulu, who is spoken of eleven millions of people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help to the self-help
World-wide there is approximately 34 million an HIV infecting, estimates Unaids, the program of the United Nations for the Bekämfung of AIDS.
23.5 millions of people of it lives in the south of Africa.
In Swaziland 245000 AIDS orphans live.
More than 40 percent of the population are in the meantime HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitjeni found the association Voices for Africa godfather in Germany.
70 of them visits a resuming school.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month one can take over a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a hot meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means on Zulu Geschichtenerzähler or also Lobpreiser.
The Bantu language to speak flowing cannot sing anybody in this area, but.
For nearly ten years the choir learns songs in this foreign soft language and returns it there now and then also where they originally come: into the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers beeline from Heidelberg remotely, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there are the village Esitjeni, which depends on the voting force of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
There about 2000 humans live, some still in simple loam and straw huts, a majority of it are children.
More than 300 of them has no more parents, because these succumbed to the HIV.
To Esitjeni it points itself in the small one that Swaziland suffers completely: highest HIV Infektionsrate, lowest life expectancy world-wide according to Unicef.
Cutting the male foreskin, which reduce the infection risk as can be prove by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
The immunodeficiency virus in itself, with center thirty to die is no more rarity carries than forty percent of humans in Swaziland.
With a common African journey in the spring 2005 the choir discovered the village, above all however saw the Imbongis many children on the roads, which it did not only lack parental welfare service, but simply at everything: Meal, clothes, education.
Without graduation one has no opportunity in a poor country more than ever.
At first it was still the private commitment of particulars to make possible for a few euro in the year a child to the school to fancy and it a hot meal on the day.
But already one year later created the choir the association “Voices for Africa”, which worries since then nearly professionally about the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts to sexual transferable infections
What are the most important sexual transferable diseases?
Among the bacterial STI syphilis, chlamydia rank and trip by (Gonorrhö).
Frequent viral STI is HIV, human Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main concerning groups?
Syphilis and trip by occur particularly with men, the sex with men have.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes at least four cases of syphilis announced of five all in Germany will transfer by sexual contacts between men.
With the heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, Trichomonaden, Candidose (mushroom) are, trip by and human Pappilomaviren frequently occurring sexual transferable diseases.
The spreading from HIV is among heterosexual adults in this country comparatively small - nevertheless: Are allotted to approximately 20 percent of the HIV new infections to this group.
Among young people chlamydia infections arise substantially more frequently than at other subpopulations.
After European collections three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years.
In this country occur besides human Pappilomaviren with young people frequently.
How did the number of the infections develop?
Not all sexual transferable diseases are compulsorily notifiable.
The number of the syphilis infections doubled itself according to the Robert Koch Institute of 1697 illnesses in the year 2001 on 3698 illnesses in the year 2011 more than.
The number of the HIV new infections decreases since 2007.
2011 gave it approximately 2700 cases.
That is for instance a tenth less than in the year before.
Which symptoms refer to a sex illness?
The infections can cause ulcers within the genital range, complaints with urinating, discharge, hypogastric region pain as well as vesicles or warts.
Often they cause however no pain or other symptoms and remain therefore unnoticed.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of an infection, offer however no hundred percent protection.
Because partially exciters of sexual transferable diseases can also by lubrication infections and confine body contact to be passed on.
Therefore experts recommend regular investigations particularly with frequently changing sex partners.
Early made a diagnosis most STI can be healed and long-term consequences be avoided.
By sponsorships, donations and not least the fees, which the choir in all of Germany ersingt itself, some meets.
“Altogether we sent, say already approximately 200,000 euros after Esitjeni” Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village administers Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident and enforcement-strong Mrs., the funds from Germany.
It worries also about it that the orphans find accomodation well, with one of the grandmothers about.
The Gogos, how one calls the old women on Zulu, is the supports of the village.
Some of them took up up to 14 orphans with itself, give them a roof over the head and ensure for the fact that the children in their uniforms appear punctual to each day to the school teaching.
Who does not have anybody more, comes into the protection house to Khanyisile, a single woman, which is paid exactly the same by the association like the two cooks, who cook each day for more than 200 hungry children.
Besides “Voices brought for Africa” a sewing school into being, built and together with the American health organization psi it organizes two chicken houses that many let a HIV test make in the village.
That is not matter of course, because the illness generally speaking country is also so obvious, one is silent it most of all dead.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo”, says Annette Lennartz, “because it with sexuality to do has.”
Actually strangely in a country, in which the king holds itself officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, king Mswati III., is well-known for its excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things it also this by the state sanctioned way of life is owed that the HIV spread in the past decades so fast.
In addition, the many migratory workers, who carry the virus by the country.
Free condoms there would be at each corner, say Annette Lennartz, “however those is hardly used.
The culture is another - flesh tons flesh.”
In order to promote the cultural exchange something, the Imbongi choir travels every two, three years together by the south of Africa and sings songs full nostalgia, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many at the southern corner of the black continent still from times of apartheids.
A bus of full white, which sing songs in a black language - so much acknowledgment brings not only tendency and joy, but already from some furious border soldiers a few tears wrested.
The journey leads always also after Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godfather children.
Even if one hardly finds the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river is it more to be familiar.
“The light” goes says there humans to Esitjeni, there is.
And if one returns the 8733 kilometers of beeline to Heidelberg, to the ramming singers into the training room at the Bergheimer road, then one sees it shining also there.

Messenger: NASA discovers ice on that Mercury
The probe Messenger found proofs for the fact that there is Mercury ice on the planet.
The ice cover should be meters thick possibly up to 20.
The US space agency NASA proved the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is appropriate for the sun next, there is water frozen also there, how from three on Thursday comes out studies published in the specialist journal “Science”.
The probe Messenger found proofs for the fact that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet lying permanently in the shade.
This should be meters thick at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20.
The water came probably from comet or possibly also asteroids, which are hit on that Mercury.
Nobody brings the find of ice however with the existence of lives on the planet in connection, said the chief scientist to the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on that Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The finds could help however thereby clarify how water and other components of the life arrived into other areas of the solar system.
By the earth citizens are about unnoticed probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix to investigate the depths of the universe.
Occasionally they send pictures to the earth: Small peepholes into infinite widths.
The picture comes from a camera, which German researchers of the Max Planck Institute developed.
The eight planets of our solar system, in addition the dwarf planet of cerium.
As Pluto, which circles behind Neptune around the sun, is not cerium after the new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006 a “planet”.
This image detail of an infrared photograph of the pencil sharpener telescope shows a “family portrait” of uncounted star generations: The oldest stars are to be recognized as blue points, more with difficulty to identify are the pink-colored “newborn children” in the star circle hall.
This asterisking screen end region - mentioned by scientists unromantic W5 - discovered the telescope pencil sharpener in the star picture Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This shimmering glow of a dying star took up the pencil sharpener telescope of NASA.
The Donut förmige ring consists of material, which the star during the dying process hurled out.
In the enormous Trifid fog, 5400 light-years remotely from the earth, develop from gas and dust new stars.
The pencil sharpener telescope of NASA shot this photo of the galactic birth room.
The pleiad star cluster, “the seven sisters”, be seen at night can be also called with the naked eye.
With the telescope however the colors become effective better.
Like a red Age the Helix fog looks against to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is 700 light-years remotely in the Aquarius constellation.
Its similarity with a terrestrial continent brought in the title North America for this fog.
A combination of normal and infrared photo provides for the spectacular colour.
This baby star could be taken up in its full beauty only by the infrared detectors of the pencil sharpener telescope.
Saturn and its rings: As these developed, is one of the large mysteries of the astronomy.
Possibly they are the remnants of a Saturn moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs of the Hubble telescope: The whirlpool galaxy
Depending upon colour photographs from spiral galaxies to true works of art become.
The admission published by the European south observatory shows the several thousand light-years distant Trifid fog in the constellation contactor.
The name Trifid comes from latin word trifidus (three-divided, three-split), there dark dust strips the glowing heart of the star birth place three-divides.
In the constellation queue carriers photographed astronomer the harbingers of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from the earth remotely race the cores of two merging galaxies one on the other too and will inevitably with one another collide.
This star birth noted the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Whom technical abbreviations are not appropriate, which may call it with her nickname southern Catherine wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows a cutout from the iris fog in the constellation Kepheus.
The 1400 light-years consists distant nebulas of dust grains, which are smaller ten to hundreds times than usual house dust.
This picture was joined from optical and radiographs of different telescopes.
It shows a ring remotely from black holes, 430 million light-years from the earth.
This group mentioned by galaxies, Arp 273, took up the space telescope Hubble for NASA.
Scientists UGC call the larger spiral galaxy 1810.
In this star fog is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The star cradle produces always new Youngster.
Also this star cloud, connected with the rosette fog, brings constantly new baby stars out - 5000 light-years from the earth removes.
In this brightly radiating galaxy with a hole still no dust, but only gas exists to little black dresses.
Researchers assume that it developed only shortly after the Big Bang, when in the universe predominantly hydrogen was to be found.
Our insights of the universe: The most important telescopes
The telescope is to have been invented 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galilei used it one year later for star observation.
Since then the mirrors of the optical telescopes became ever more largely - and the insights, which supply them, ever more deeply.
30 years long, i.e. from 1947 to 1975, the resounding telescope was in the Palomar observatory close San Diego the largest telescope of the world.
Der Spiegel, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It permits views in the universe equal over two mirrors, everyone with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner feelings of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Kanareninsel La Palma are enormous - alone the mirror comes on 10.4 meters in the diameter.
Der Spiegel of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - around costs to save.
Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable building method: The telescope is fastened in its elevation angle - and thus its mobility limits.
Also the hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is fixed in the elevation angle.
Its characteristic: the high light collecting strength.
This reaches up - despite comparatively small mirror diameter - to those of the world-wide largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researcher hears the universe after extraterrestial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
With the “search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence” (SETI) can help each owner of computer, by making computing power available.
View of the observatory of the European observatory (ESO) into the Chilean Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope stands - which makes for its name all honour.
With its altogether four mirrors can the telescope also the middle infrared spectrum illuminate.
Likewise on the Chilean ESO observatory the European Extremely Large Telescope is planned.
Its main mirror is to be covered full 42 meters - and be set from scarcely 1000 mirror elements together.
On pictures however at the earliest 2018 are to be counted.
To 2007 the two saucy telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were valid as the largest world.
They offer equivalent two mirrors with one average each of ten meters.
The saucy telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which looks beside them still with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF into the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea is a new, enormous telescope develop - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However the space telescope Hubble supplies the most important impressions from the universe.
Since 24 April 1990 it already supplies pictures of far worlds.
Since March 2009 looks for the space telescope Kepler for extra-solar planets - main for such, which are habitable.
On 2 February 2011 by NASA it was announced that 1235 planet candidates were determined since beginning of mission.
In the picture the last start preparations at the space telescope documented Kepler.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot at the earliest 2018 on board a Ariane5-Rakete in the universe.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is to look for light of the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume also at the South Pole Mercury the ice exists.
However there are for it no reliable data since Messenger far more near at the north pole around the planet circles.
Radar measurements pointed for decades after that there is Mercury on the ice.
By the 2004 started Messenger probe - which circles first, those around Mercury - the scientists have now certainty.

Daily drink butter - and 168 years become old
In the south of Azerbaijan many humans reach Biblically a great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A tracing in the country, in which 97-year old are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan many humans reach Biblically a great age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A tracing in the country, in which 97-year old are still comparatively young.
The trip by the Talysch mountains is to be called wild and romantic.
The minibus rumbles over the winding road, past at closely wooded hills, rapid rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, one could mean, one would be in the Black Forest.
But that is here the deepest south of Azerbaijan, which is border to Iran only few kilometers remotely.
Here the Caucasian ethnic group Taly lives, from which much does not admit is, except that it perfectly Persian as well as Aserisch speaks and is very long-lived.
Last stop is Lerik.
The small small town shows off also to massively guessed/advised architecture from Soviet times, which does not want so at all to fit into the pictorial mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, are too cumbersome start from of Azerbaijan capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometers one needs eight hours, because the road is only single-lane one.
The incredible wealth, which the country owes to its oil in the Caspian sea, did not arrive here in the province yet.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced of the fact that Lerik has things for tourist attraction.
“Baku became famous in May with the euro vision song festival - and in the next year to have we here a festival of oldest humans of the world”, says Fatulayeva.
She is a directress of the museum for longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the résumé of approximately eight dozen, those documented Taly from the area older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
That is my grandfather, he here became 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years still another child witnessed
But disputed star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Șirali Müslümov, which is to have become 168 years old.
A birth certificate does not give it however.
And in view of oldest documented humans, who became 122 years old, Müslümovs age appears nevertheless extremely doubtful.
“1805 it was born in the region, 1973 died here it”, describes Fatulayeva.
The man was three times married and 23 children had, at the age of 136 years is he still another daughter to have witnessed.
Did Șirali Müslümov charge itself thus regarding its age around a few decades?
In addition, rem Brandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of the aged ones in Central Asia.
“Remarkable many hochaltrige humans gives it also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan”, says Scholz, “also in Sardinien lives extremely many very old men”.
Because of missing documents however no scientific proof is to be led across the age, particularly since person condition registers were missing.
Each day becherweise melted butter
Fact is however that humans of the region approximately achieve a Biblical age around Lerik remarkably frequently.
At present it gives 20 persons, who are older than 100 years.
Why thus here do so many aged ones live in the south?
The aserische travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains with the special genes Taly.
Museum directress Fatulayeva against it believes that it is because of the nutrition.
But that calculated the calorie-rich food Taly should be so healthy, the meat, bread and above all milk products love and of those many daily a glass melted butter to drink, do not appear also straight from nourish-scientific view plausibly.
Or is it the original way of life, which keeps humans young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement nearby the city Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years it is still comparatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, which states, to have 143 descendants lives that in a simple timber building, is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
It sits on the ground with a butter barrel, which and rolls her untiringly.
Eight humans live here under a roof, under it one of Mirzayevas sons and a daughter, both are for a long time grandparents.
Also two infants jump around.
In the kitchen one prepares tea, which is served in the typical, bauchförmigen Armadu glass ones for the guests.
Mirzayevas white teeth stand perfectly in line up and to member, under their headscarf hide them long, light brown plaits, which their son reveals proudly before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, then they never went out me and kept their color.
“I used, say shampoo also never” Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to the life
She ate in each case that, which came from its own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life long I did not buy only once in the supermarket food.
Then it tells of its man, who was in the army.
It was worst in the time after the Second World War.
But everything became better, than the “loved father” Heydar Aliyew took over the rudder.
Propaganda sounds strangely from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult, which is driven around the father figure of the nation, its country like a dictator governed, hardly knows borders in Azerbaijan.
Until 2003 he was at power, later took over its son Ilham the rudder.
There is nevertheless no emergency among of Azerbaijan old persons.
, Mirzayeva receives 230 Manat (for instance the same sum in euros) monthly as pension, for local conditions an amount, on which one can live well.
And perhaps also Mirzayevas is right for a long time turned grey son: “The old persons enjoy respect in our culture.”
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared and are happy.
If that is not a reason to remain as for a long time as possible alive

The word “human right” is missing in the condition
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivaling demonstrations in Cairo reveal deep splitting of the country.
The future condition with the sharia as basis is violently disputed.
The Egyptian president did not save with pathos.
We must create the transition.
“And that it succeeds, it lies in my responsibility, before the people and before God”, said it in public television.
Its speech was addressed to the whole people, above all however probably secular one at Christian Copt, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and.
Because they all, so far hopelessly fell out in a muddle-headed opposition, have fear.
Fear of a theocracy at the Nile of grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
It has, then Mohammed Mursi said nearly excusing, the authority of the constitutional court temporarily circumcisedly and its authority extended, “by the revolution to save”.
But which the 61-year old wants to really save engineer, who carries a doctor title of the American university of Southern California, over it itself the Egyptians are, are not whole itself the world in the clear one.
Is to be deprived of power the judicial power?
The 234 articles, which were pushed through there by the Islamist dominated 100-member condition-giving meeting in a night, 15-hour Parforceritt, are actual partial worrisome ones.
As in earlier conditions also it is called the jurisdiction in the draft, bases on the “principles of Islamic right”.
But which is called “principles”?
That was and is interpretation thing and it stands to fear that the Islamists will use the spongelike formulation and the legal clearance exerted by it for a stricter design of the sharia.
That suggests at least a newly in addition-led article: In all the sharia affairs concerned must the Al-Ashar-university advises to be pulled, the most important Islamic institution of the country with large charisma into the entire Sunni Islam.
That does not have, but it can mean that the ministry supervises the legislation, which would entail de facto incapacitating the judicial power.
Much in the Verfassunsgsentwurf is interpretation thing
Also problematic: The civilian military jurisdiction is to remain further maintained.
These courts served rule during Mubaraks for the suppression of oppositionals.
After the fall of the dictator sat up to 11.000 civilians in military detention.
The state is also, then it in the draft, “the true nature of the Egyptian family” is located protects “and their moral and their values promotes”.
That is legally so in a diffuse way formulated that national institutions with the help of this article even could control contents of film art and literature.
In the plain language that means nothing else as censorship.
No article by the way fixes expressly the equality of men and women.
For another forbids insulting or slandering the prophet Mohammed and its envoys.
Which however an offense is and is like it to be punished, remains unclear.
Just as dubiously the formulation seems, which is “offense of humans” forbidden.
Is a caricature of the president there already enough or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation thing, as so much in the draft, which is present Mursi to the signature and according to him “very soon” for popular vote will be presented to the Egyptians.
“The revolution returned”
The opposition is formed for weeks against the supremacy of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands met in unusual unity on Friday evening at the Tahrir place in Cairo and praised to bring the Charter to case before it can step into force.
“The revolution returned and we will triumph”, said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place finisher of the presidential elections.
Nobel peace prize carrier and ex-boss of the international atomic energy authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained, the draft constitution belonged “on the garbage mountain of history”.
Via news headlines service Twitter he accused the supporters Mursis to want to lead a “putsch against the democracy”.
“If he the referendum proclaims, we to his palace will go and him fall”, said the oppositional Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers are atoned yet”, did not quote the Egyptian media the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to supervise the referendum whereby it would become invalid.
“The Koran is our condition”
The well organized Muslim Brotherhood blew for its part for counter demonstration, as a precaution however not at the Tahrir place, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile bank before the Kairoer university.
Many masked women and supporter of the Salafisten participated in it and called: “The people demands the use of God law.”
They demanded from Mursi: “Clean the country!” and protested: “The Koran is our condition.”
A fight for the sovereignty over the highly symbolic Tahrir place, at which everything took its beginning, would probably have caused conditions like civil war.
Mursis supporters did not want to risk that completely obviously.
The Muslim Brotherhood explained, both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents loud and clearly would have expressed themselves.
Now the time is to let the people at the ballot box decide into which direction the country is to go.
A majority for the draft of the Islamists is considered as safe.
“The word of human rights does not even come forwards”
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious over this forced condition process, which would have actually by February to go and all social forces to merge be supposed.
The 48-year old human right lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian organization for human rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood, when they sat under Mubarak in the prison or were located in court.
Because it would not divide their world view, but because for it human rights are indivisible.
But it was lambasted, condemned, arrested.
“And now the word of human rights is located in the new condition”, does not even deplore it in the discussion with the “world on Sunday”.
Mursi expansion of power on all three force in the state let the lawyer resign.
These measures are striking offences against democratic rules and Egypt into a new dictatorship will lead.
“Instead of the civil society to strengthen, set the president it de facto repealed”, deplore Saeda.
But without civilian-social organizations a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels alone left, also from the international community, which regards the ideological direction fight at the Nile with a mixture from curiosity and tension.
That could avenge itself.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: “You gebährt a monster, it any longer to control can.”

Rakfisk from Norway: Is the most ill-smelling fish of the world?
The five million inhabitant of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - and not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the success secret of the country have to do something with the local appetite on rather evil-smelling fish?
One takes a selection of overripe cheese places.
One places it in the midst of a heap of dirty, damp sport clothes.
And leave it there one week.
So approximately one must imagine the nose-numbing smell of Rakfisk, one of large delicacies of Norway.
I am in the small city Fagernes, about three hours remotely from Oslo.
There is here snow, spectacular landscapes - and this persistent smell in the air, to which simply does not want to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt covered trout, which - dependent on how stinking one gladly would have its fish - up to one year in water is fermented.
If into Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes colder, Norwegians flow here to a celebration into Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, really very captivating speciality.
“One eats it roughly and rinses it then with a glass of Aquavit down”, says Havard Halvarsen, which actually works in the local fire station, but when so-called “Rakfisk general” organizes also the festival.
Over people small fish cubes consume and take us around in addition large quantities of alcohol to itself.
“Man people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk”, say Havard.
The Spirituose can displace the smell.
I cost some bits.
If one avoids it to bring the Rakfisk in nose proximity he is not badly - about like Sushi, which has a quite long bus travel behind itself.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different one, by far poorer Norwegian epoch, than there were and fish in the autumn in hermetic seawater barrels were soaked still no cooling possibilities.
In the deepest winter it was taken out then after long fermentation and - certainly with the aid of alcohol absorbed senses - consumes.
Still before a generation thousands Norwegians saw themselves in the search for work in a forced manner to leave their country and emigrated mainly into the USA.
Today the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted from a flourishing job market, high wages and a comprehensive health service.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who before not yet all too long time by far enrich was as Norway, flow immigrants.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, although strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
It belongs to the more expensive courts, which one can buy here.
But here yes everything is actually expensive - a small glass beer or sand-yielded costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not create it often into the world press, and that does not seem to disturb most people.
Here one hates it still to call differently Breivik with the name - that racist right-wing extremist, who shot last year of 77 men, women and children.
Instead one refers only to the “incident from 22 July”.
Norwegians have trouble to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murders in their pacific country.
For the today's wealth of Norway the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industries of the world is mainresponsible since the early 1970's.
“However oil is not the only reason, why we so well are, say” Anna, our waitress, who embodies round tray with ripe Rakfisk distributed and with their long blond hair and that stinging blue eyes the Nordic ideal.
We are in as say one - prudent people.
Their English is here immaculate exactly like that of most humans.
We are not very swankily, we like no bragging.
Norway dealt with its oil wealth very carefully - a large part of the branch yields is invested for the well-being of future generations in special funds.
When in the years up to the world economic crisis all threw with money around itself, which they did not possess at all, Norway kept its purse firmly locked.
“We in the winter ski to drive so long and in the summer walking go can, are happy we”, say Anna.
“And naturally Rakfisk eat”, add them with unencumbered laughter.
I am located in the snow and place myself for another court on of Rakfisk have I enough.
Such a moose Burger is in any case something else. The juicy meat mundet me.
But on evening again the stinking fish stands on the menu.
The hotel, logiere, is one of several places of event, which a Rakfisk Dinner organizes, with which, in which I, guests for the best - or perhaps the senses of smell at the strongest provocative - fish vote can.
There is a live TV circuit to one with fly dressed show master, which is surrounded with Rakfisk by plates.
The spectacle resembles the euro vision the song Contest.
“Which score have you there above in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jürgen?”
“Here our points are, Havard”.
One applauds and laughs.
A man falls overwhelmed by its chair, possibly from the Aquavit.
But perhaps it is the strict vapor of the whole fish nevertheless.

Of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto stands before difficult start
While of Mexico prepares future president Enrique Pena Nieto for its assumption of office, Will Grant analyzes forthcoming challenges and the feelings of his people mixed by the BBC it.
Up-to-date traffic is completely particularly bad in Mexico City.
Even on better days this is a always clogged city, but on Monday a ring from steel was established, which closes off several important traffic routes into the capital and on the roads for chaos provides.
The goal was it however not to disturb commuters on the way to the work to prevent but demonstrators from it the parliament to reach.
On Saturday will of Mexico new president Enrique Pena Nieto president-bind to receive and the guidance of the nation to take over.
It stands before a complex task.
Under the separating government Felipe Calderons could himself prove Mexico economically well, but the country is in the grasp of a drug war, which cost 60,000 human lives in the last six years already.
“My government engages itself strongly to reduce the force”, explained Pena Nieto earlier this week in the oval Office US-American president Barack Obama.
I will suggest a new safety strategy, with which we can achieve this goal.
Before it went with the US president on eye level, Pena Nieto was active as a governor of its mother country Mexico.
In this closely settled, extensive part of the country, which surrounds the capital, the opinions are divided over the new head of state.
A direct man
In the remote town Valle del Bravo one remembers for example gladly him.
Inhabitants of the resort attribute the development of the tourism and the structure of the infrastructure to him.
In order to reach the city, one can drive on one of the motorways, the Pena Nieto build let and the one large improvement opposite the fragile, bumpy roads represent, which there were here once.
Plaques with its name hang also outside of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum to the climate change.
“We expect of him genuine and continuous changes”, so its friend and political allied Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, which as a congressional representative for the party Pena Nietos, which works PRI.
In particular, which concerns security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change, which needs our country so urgently.
After 81 years at power the PRI was replaced in the year 2000 from Vicente Fox.
The congressional representative Olvera admits that the party places large expectations after 12 years outside of the presidential palace of lot Pinos at Enrique Pena Nieto.
The reproaches of the opposition, to the new president be missing it at substance, reject it.
It is very committed a very direct man, and has large plans for the country.
He is a outstanding statesman, above all is he in addition, someone, that can listen.
But on the other side of the state many humans do not divide this opinion over their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also admits as Ciudad Neza, could not the contrast to the paved roads of Valle del Bravo be not larger.
The place is hidden under motorway transfers and represents in many ways a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the community are from crucially urban nature.
Beginning of this year was switched on the military, in order to fight the drug gangs operating in the quarters, and force against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a fallow land in the proximity of a large garbage depot alone in the last two years the corpses of dutzender murdered women were left to marks.
While the term of office of governor Pena Nieto became in the state Mexico over 1.000 women murdered - a statistics, which exceeds even those the city Ciudad Juarez, which for their force and the murders at innocent women is notorious.
The critics Pena Nietos are the view that it is at least inappropriate concerned the problem of the woman murders during its term of office.
But in the worst case its government locked its eyes before the problem.
In a building of concrete, typically for the run down quarter, Irinea Buendia with the tears fights, when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version of the events according to Mariana committed 2010 suicide.
But their family believes that it was murdered by her life companion.
“As I with it at home arrived, seemed it, as if its body had been washed”, remembers Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was struck, and the corpse rigidity had already begun.
While its mother tell her story, a picture of Mariana on us looks down from the wall. It is attached beside a cross, which carries a single word: Justice.
But exactly this, so the family, one refused it up to now.
The authorities treated me, as if I am a babbler, troublemaker, Nörglerin.
They would like that one accepted its judgement simply and holds the mouth.
“However that is not possible, if there were, say so many formal defects and omissions” it.
If president Pena Nieto president-binds on Saturday receives, it takes thereby also a large responsibility.
Tens of thousands Mexican families were pulled in the last six years by violent crimes in, and the new president promised particularly to worry during its term of office about this problem.
“I hope, as a president am he like that, as he as a governor was”, say the PRI congressional representative Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But before it the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza at most are afraid exactly.

The public prosecutor's office states: Bradley Manning did not weight about mistreatment
The public prosecutor's office contradicts Bradley Mannings's reproaches, it in the prison was abused
The hearing is concerned with Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense aims at a rejection of the accusation due to too hard prison conditions
One accuses to the Gefreiten of the US-army thousand confidential documents to have stolen
The public prosecutor's office tried Friday to state that the Armeegefreite Bradley Manning - accused for the largest exposure of confidential information of US-American history - several opportunities missed to weight about the mistreatment suffered allegedly by it in military detention.
With a cross questioning Mannings during a before-judicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden fine that documents it did not exhibit to weekly visits, which had made prison officials during Mannings of nine-month term of imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia any complaints over his treatment.
One day before the cross questioning, which was held due to a request of the defense for the rejection of the accusation - Manning had been already sufficiently punished by the hard term of imprisonment - had Manning stated, it would have the suicide in the prison considered.
The secret service analyst of the US-army, which in June 2010 one arrested, is accused, during its office hours in Iraq thousand confidential documents to have stolen.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks in the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as source of the information.
In the hearing on Friday fine with Manning went through the forms, which had filled out officials after their meetings with Manning during its detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had served a sentence prison conditions intensified by July 2010 until April 2011 under.
The officials placed Manning Fragen and would label its answers.
When fine asked it on Friday to the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as “excellent” and the treatment by the facility altogether as “very professionally”.
The forms, so fine, did not contain complaints over mistreatment, although the officials had asked Manning directly to his treatment.
Manning answered, he had expressed his doubts verbally and had discussed and had indicated the officials these with him to be concerned as these. They were not logged however.
“You would label (after meeting of the doubts) “no problems”, and the meant not necessarily that I said nothing at all”, so Manning.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, asked Manning also, why it did not weight about its treatment, when he met in January 2011 with a committee, that should examine from him some months before on a form mentioned suicidal ideation.
Manning answered, its intention during this meeting had consisted of letting its observation status downgrade for the “prevention of injuries”.
The military stated, it had it this restrictive status - which stands a stage under the suicide endangerment - to its and the protection of others assigned.
“I wanted to convince employees of the fact that I well was, and the observation status for the prevention of injuries gets rid of (...) around a from my point of view higher quality of life to reach to be able”, said Manning.
Manning stated at Thursday to its arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held approximately two months, before he was moved in July 2010 into the prison of naval base Quantico in Virginia.
He said, in Kuwait he had considered the suicide and had become once unconscious due to the heat.
Does not know to be allowed, what with it or in the outside world happens, is loading.
“My world diminished on Camp Arafjon, on this cage”, said Manning on Thursday.
I thought, I in this cage would die.
When it was moved after Quantico, Manning had spent the majority of its days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
One permitted it only one mattress, a cover, flip-flop, clothes and its eyeglasses.
Manning said, he had tried to remain in motion because on day it was forbidden to sleep or only lie down.
Always it had to sleep with light, which penetrated from the outside into its cell.
If it turned at night and guards could not see its face any longer, one had waked it up, so that he turns back again.
In January 2011 Mannings lawyer raised formally objection against the treatment Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was moved into the military prison from away Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday the judge asked Manning likewise to an accusation, which it had raised in its statement on Thursday - in such a way he had one night naked in his cell in Quantico to sleep and with a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners to be located have.
Manning had stated, he had never had the opportunity during this counting coat itself with his cover.
For the questioning on Friday Manning indicated, he had concluded from an instruction of his guard that he the cover, with which he could himself have covered, fall let should. It admitted however that nobody had requested it in addition.
On Thursday Manning had stated that he was forced at the previous night to sleep naked. It would have tried before to show an official that it does not represent a danger for itself.
Manning said to the official, he could not have used the federation of its pants or his flip-flops, in order to injure itself, however done this.
At this night, then Manning stated, its pants, flip-flops and eyeglasses from its cell was removed.
Its lawyers hope that the judge its detention experiences will drastically reduce at least to consider and his detention measure, should it with his negotiation before the military court be condemned. This is set for beginning of next year.
The defense indicated that Manning will admit itself of smaller offences for guilty, while other charges, which than are too extremely regarded, are to be contested.
The continuation of the hearing is set for this weekend. A justification of the prison conditions is expected by the public prosecutor's office.
The Pentagon remains with its position that in accordance with Manning the regulations one held, which kept prisoners for all under highest safety precautions in Quantico are valid.
Among the charges against Manning rank the promotion of the enemy, illegitimate publication of secretofficial information in the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If it is found in all charges for guilty, a lifelong detention threatens him.

My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many humans are compelling due to the missing opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans tend to accuse the emigrants of - they call them hard times in the memory, say it
Navarrette is the opinion that Mexican Americans between two worlds are imprisoned
On a recent journey after Mexico City I had crossed just the hall and had arrived at the passport check, when embarrassment in me made itself broad.
Signs referred to two queues: One for “Mexicanos” (“Mexican”), another for “Extranjeros” (“foreigner”).
I stood there some seconds long, uncertainly, to which I should go.
I grew up in central California and my whole life long “Mexicans” was called.
An ethnic contraction - exactly the same, as my friends in Boston call themselves “Irish” or my friends in New York “Italians”.
Later I decided for “Mexican American”.
But that was Mexico here.
And in the homeland of my grandfather there was no need according to contractions or hyphens.
I was simply only American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough, in order to maintain me in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and my American accent become likewise not loose I.
Thus took I mean American passport and placed themselves into the queue for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment of this week, when future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the white house, in order to meet with president Obama.
On the agenda stood all those topics, which one expects, if the heads of these two countries meet: Immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was interested also very much to speak about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for the fact that Mexicans remain nowadays with just as high probability in Mexico, instead of emigrating into the United States.
It would like to create itself with the United States and Canada groups and a North American commercial block after model of the European union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug trusts even if it called in this connection no details.
Of Mexico relationship to the United States is complicated and full resentments.
Most Americans waste only one thought on it that the United States broke in the year 1848 in Mexico and forced the guidance of the country under reproached rifle to it, them more than half of their territory to probably never leave.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be ignored.
As soon as thus a US Government official practices only mild Estonian criticism at Mexico, one - in the Mexican press and under the elite of the country - hears complaints how the Americans press the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children Montezumas go on the warpath.
And the largest challenge of Mexico is appropriate nevertheless for Mexican Americans, who live in the United States in truth in the relationship with more than 35 million.
Desire to speak about resentment?
There are more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. Humans, for whom the country offers opportunities, and other one, for whom it does not do this.
The only reason, why so many humans of Mexican origin in cities live such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, consists of the fact that at one point in our family tree a person - perhaps a parents or grandparents - got no opportunity in Mexico required and toward the north emigrated.
And this person in most cases corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these humans, and our loyalty is valid for them.
Not Mexico.
And although we live perhaps now the American dream, visited good schools and it received good jobs we may never lose out of sight that it is the American dream, which we do not live - the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes possibly blurred, but which concerns our loyalty, this is not the case.
This is valid clearly for the United States.
Beyond that we are conscious to us that many members of the Mexican guidance layer do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They look down us to look as memorial of a humiliating defeat and on us, because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be never well enough, our gang to Mexico strong enough.
According to their opinion our existence is a symbol of the failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we nevertheless somehow did not lose ourselves now behind the silk curtain imprisoned to see - with a pleasant life in the United States, but.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and as a child legally to the United States immigrated, reminds me of the fact that between Mexicans and Mexican Americans tensions exist, because Mexicans possess a clearer conception over it, who they are - and Mexican Americans take them this badly.
While she is US-American state citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans, whom I know, have the feeling to belong neither on the one hand nor on the other hand country.
We love the Mexican volume lot Tigres del Norte, in addition, Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys that best ones of both worlds, but is rooted in none of it.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
How I should learn during my journey, there is something, which makes this relationship still more complicated: Some Mexican guidance persons and parts of the education middle class would like to again get in touch their to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional “Ambassadors” for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We are to tell our American colleagues how great a visit of this country is and exercises pressure on the political guidance to intensify their connections to Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many injured feelings.
And in view of the unfair income distribution, the unbridled corruption and the drug force many of us are not at all safe so whether it really concerns a great country.
I am afraid, there must do it alone through, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready, the United States for handling Mexico one and a half centuries ago to assign, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans preserve a resentment for it, how their family members were not treated forwards at all only so long time.
Hmmm.
Perhaps we are “Mexican”, than I thought.

Old engagements, the new Near East
The armistice between Israel and the Hamas could prove as unexpected cornerstones for the peace
Can there ever be continuous peace between Arabs and Jews in the Near East?
The newest bloody events seem to suffocate such a hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual accusations countless buildings were put in debris and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of it civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza are hit in the proximity of the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem imprisoned in their historical conflict, the Near East changes around it.
Arab spring created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or non Palestinians and Israelis is part of these confusions become.
Perhaps this will lead only to more bloodsheds.
But there are reasons to the acceptance that the deadly deadlock could find finally their end.
A war, which is lost nor won neither
At first sight optimism seems in view of the current situation everything else as appropriate.
Even if on 21 November the agreed upon armistice continues, this-week fights the hardsimmered on both sides strengthened.
The leaders of the Hamas, which Islamist movement, which controls the Gaza Strip since 2007, from itself to state the Israelis to have pushed back although its grouping had to register large losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitant of the Gaza Strip in one the desolatest and closely populating Estonian corners of the planet are crammed in, Israel did not succeed in up to now destroying the Hamas.
The Hamas in the West Jordan territory actually gains, which is controlled by the rivaling, moderate Palestinian group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come in the end that they have the time on their side.
Thus, as Islamists in the Arab world at influence won, the Hamas could pull powerful and rich friends on its side.
Turkey, one like-those-strong-ends, regional power, which was considered once as of Israel of closest Muslim allying, for Hamas Partei seized - exactly like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf States.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that around Israel an Islamist half-moon forms - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hezbollah has power over Syria, where rebels of an increasingly more Islamist coinage before falling Bashar Assads could stand up to Jordan, where Hamas allying threatens the king.
And in particular the ascent of the Muslim Brotherhood under president Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - which with distance inhabitant-strongest and most important Arab country - at the southern flank of Israel the balance of the region changed effectively.
Hosni Mubarak, the laicist despot, which governed Egypt up to its fall 2011 30 years long, had only little time for the Hamas remaining.
In contrast to it those depends more strongly on people opinions brother shank with the Hamas related by marriage and their leaders.
With future diplomatic negotiations the Hamas could prove as a participant, who cannot be out-pushed even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners however let an opposite conclusion pull.
Militarily seen the Hamas is no more danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, “Iron of cathedrals”, could themselves work satisfactorily and many of the Hamas rockets was destroyed.
At least one while long will be able to sleep Israel more calmly.
In diplomatic regard the United States hold unshakeably to their position. Many European countries made the Hamas responsible for the newest force escalations.
Israel was issued it in last years well, in particular under prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country remained relatively free by suicide bombers - not least owing to the check plants, which in-run into the West Jordan territory and thus into the main part of a any Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were explained for contrary to international law, however to be developed always further.
Netanyahu stands well there. Its Likud party allied itself before the elections on 22 January under Avigdor Lieberman with a still more aggressive group.
Why also do these deceitful Palestinians mollycoddle and them their own state left?
If they had actually control of the West Jordan territory, wouldn't they then fire exactly like their fellow combatants in the Gaza Strip also rockets?
No, it is better to hold and punish it behind the wall in chess, should it dare to lift the heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will be able themselves to implement. But Arab spring could make a line for them by the bill.
Even if the Islamists, who sit now in Egypt and in other countries at power, have few for Israel remaining, they will concentrate first on the difficulties in the own country.
The defense budget of Israel is together larger than its four Arab neighbours.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments during the repair of its economy.
That pragmatic president Mursi with Barack Obama together-did, in order to reach an armistice, perhaps a promiseful indication could be - and symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Also Israelis should think more on a long-term basis.
While the remaining Arab world undertakes timid steps toward democratization, Palestinians are robbed further of their right of self-determination - a powder keg, which one day in the Israeli occupied territories will certainly explode, exactly like this week a bus in Tel Aviv exploded.
The suppression undermines already the democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will be only intensified.
Bloody missions to the repelling of the Hamas in the Gaza Strip will demand their diplomatic tribute over the years increasingly.
Both sides need an impact from the outside
The correct answer is that one, those by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the remaining world and by this newspaper is represented: Two states, at which Israel retires for security purposes areas.
- For the near future small - hope consists of the fact that the armistice grants outsiders more influence for the enforcement of this solution.
Egypt must stop now together with Turkey and Qatar the weapon supplies in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever before, in order to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on basis of the borders of 1967, supplemental by exchange of territory and a common Jerusalem.
Outstanding Arab nations should likewise induce the Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
Thus more would be done for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN-observer status.
Also Obama must contribute its part to move Israel to negotiations.
During its first term of office it missed the conception of its own peace plan.
Remotely in the white house it seems far, as if it would be just as averse from a participation.
But that is an unfortunate, short-sighted perspective.
The United States have a substantial interest in stable the Near East.
And in addition a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians belongs.

Australian laws for uniform cigarette packing come into force
Health warnings and gotten sick parts of the body on neutral green packings, which are alike for all tobacco marks
Those world-wide first laws for uniform cigarette and tobacco packing stepped in Australia. With it mark logos and colors are replaced olive green covers, which are printed on with drastic pictures beyond that by neutral, which suffer parts of the body and by cigarette smoke of gotten sick babies and children show.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures once the only difference between the packings exists in the label names starting from coming Saturday, which are printed in identical, small writing.
Thus Australia introduces the world-wide strictest regulations for tobacco packing.
The Australian Federal Government wants to divert young people of smoking, as the glamorous picture of the tobacco consumption is eliminated.
The government of studies goes out, which showed that humans, who did not begin with 26 yet to smoke with 99%-iger probability will not no more begin also thereafter.
“One can see with children of recent age that they understand the message, which tobacco companies with their mark picture try to apply”, so Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies, which showed for example that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia exhibits one of the smallest smoker ratios of the world and the changes will affect only slightly the profits of the multinational companies, other countries consider already similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
Thus it was called, with the laws the black market trade was favoured, which leads to cheaper and more easily accessible cigarettes.
“The laws become serious, unintentional consequences lead”, say Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer by far larger quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others however say that the laws set their business in motion.
Sandra Ha von Zico import Pty Ltd., a small exempt private company, marks that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone covers for the cover of the intolerable packing enormously rose, since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, failed Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago because of the highest Australian Court of Justice with their contestation of the laws.
Zico sold up to 6.000 units to wholesale firms and waits for new existence.
For us that is a good business.
According to experts the hook lies in the popularity of social media at exactly the subpopulation, to which the plan addresses itself.
A number of Australian laws forbade tobacco companies from the TV-advertisement banished, it to them to appear as sport sponsors and most resellers forced not to lay cigarettes out in business longer. Now the tobacco advertisement is changed in the Internet.
The Australian government forbade, possesses Internet advertisement by local enterprises and sides however no influence on international sides.
“Who does not have tobacco marketed and only a small range remaining, in order to apply its products, comes around the Internet around”, says Becky Freeman, Forscherin in the health service at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook Freeman determined a rise at empiric reports to marks, which were written by “completely normal people”.
One must place oneself the question: Is that bare a private person, who finds so large favour at Marlboro cigarettes that she takes up for it even a video - or has a marketing agency thereby to do?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry concentrates instead of on marketing to argue with the new laws.
It went even so far, Ukraine, paying Honduras and the Dominican republic in order to contest the new regulations - those countries weight at the world trade organization about unfair commercial restrictions, although none of the countries operates larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for center 2013.
According to Plibersek the government discussions with other countries led, which consider similar packing laws.
Canada was 2001 the first country, which prescribed photographic warnings.
Meanwhile these were expanded on more than 40 countries, among them Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers appear stubbornly.
The pictures do not affect me.
I ignore it simply.
“One takes oneself simply a dump and puts the box away”, says Victor El Hage with the purchase of a cigarette box, on which a photo with a mouth tumor is printed.
Honestly said there is only one reason, why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, Betreiber of the tobacco trade “King OF the pack” in the city center of Sydney, says, the uniform packing made a filling up more difficult of its shelves.
“Early one I used one hour, in order to sort a supply, now need I four”, say Yu.
“The government should have forbidden cigarettes simply completely - then we would have said okay, that were it, we make close”, add he obviously furious.

In a constantly electrified world it is beautiful to be also times bored
This Thanksgiving spent I unexpectedly five hours in the airport, when our airplane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flier.
I had thus enough time, in order to make for me a few thoughts on boredom.
I do not want to lie.
A half day at the airport for a flight to wait, is rather nerve-racking -, if books, magazines and iPhones (and naturally taxfree shopping) are available.
But more and more university graduates and child development experts would start boredom as something positive.
If it goes according to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be occasionally bored.
Thus the brain is forced to lose itself in interesting trains of thought which possibly promotes creativity.
And because most of us nearly constantly stare to other screen nowadays at or, the advantages of the boredom do not benefit us.
Should we welcome the boredom thus with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
Whereupon I return again.
Like many humans also I always assumed boredom is a relatively current phenomenon, which developed with increasing spare time.
But Peter Toohey, professor for Greek and Roman history at the university of Calgary in Canada and author of “boron cathedral: A Lively History” (Yale University press, 2011) does not see that in such a way.
“Actual has the boredom a very long history”, says it.
The house walls of Pompeii makes a fuss latin graffiti over boredom, which decreases to the first century.
And then is there still the question, as we actually define boredom.
John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of the psychology at the University of York in Ontario, according to Canada consists the problem of the fact that boredom in various kinds defined and was discussed.
To long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a focus group of approximately 100 persons professor Eastwood and its colleagues came at the conclusion that itself boredom does not let this define as the experience to want to exercise “a satisfying activity however to be able”.
Boredom differs from apathy therefore in such a way that the person is not busy, this however to be would like.
With apathy however give it no urge to do something.
The key experience of the boredom, he says, exists in a “disturbance of the attention process, paired with bad mood and the feeling that the time passes only slowly”.
Boredom can sound thereby nearly in such a way like depression.
But professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions could stand in connection, sees bored persons the problem in its environment or the world, while depressive persons see the problem in itself.
Sometimes we believe that us is boring, even if we have only difficulties to concentrate us.
In its study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining boron cathedral in term OF Attention” - to German about: “The dormant understanding: The definition of boredom under the aspect of the attention”, which appeared in September in the technical periodical “Perspectives on Psychological Science”, wise professor Eastwood and its colleagues on an earlier experiment, with which participants listened to a volume, on which a person a magazine article read out.
Some groups heard a loud television programme from the neighbouring area, which did not have to do anything with contents. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was hardly perceptible, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The persons, who heard the hardly audible television, indicated, to feel more boredom than the two other groups - they did not have problems to concentrate could for this a reason find and attributed their difficulties of the boredom.
If one tries to concentrate on a difficult or arduous task the disturbance of the attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor for neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If one can divert however a monotonous activity exercised - “as the search for incorrect products on a factory conveyor, music and help, bored not to feel”.
Actually, then he says, knows we now that Herumzappeln and scratching interpret, often as an indication of boredom, these to even fight can, as persons remain physically more attentive.
“Studies showed that children, who may herumhampeln learn more and keep more information than those, which are forced to sitting still”, so professor Fenske.
Us all becomes sometime boring once - my late flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly fatiguing film.
But some persons bore themselves more easily than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed a “scale into the 1980er years to boredom susceptibility”.
On the scale statements are like “many things, which I must do, repeat themselves and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I do not have enough time for everything”.
Researchers found assistance out of such scales that boy becomes more frequently boring than girl, so Stephen Vodanovich, professor for psychology at the University of west Florida - in particular, which concerns the need according to more and a wide variety of external attractions.
But generally teenagers are a rather bracing heap.
In the year 1991 Reed Larson, professor for human and community development at the university of Illinois, an experiment, accomplished with which it contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times on the day with a Pager.
It found out that 32% of the growing up were bored at school and when settling the homework, whereas 23% indicated to be bored if they at school were not.
But only 3% of parents indicated to feel bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he knows not whether the percentage shares rose or sank regarding the boredom.
It is however sure itself that “the youth is felt as particularly boring”, mainly, because children and teenagers do not have large influence on their expiration of everyday life.
Back thus to my origin question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes, because in extreme cases it does not lead to it that humans take on extreme physical risks and to gambling or drugs purge, in order it to alleviate - studies showed that.
On the other hand many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is professor Vodanovich, who investigates the topic for more than two decades.
“With the boredom the brain wants to say to one that one should do something else”, so Gary Marcus, professor for psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not know always, what one should do straight best.
If one is boring and one uses this energy, in order to play and cook guitar, one becomes happy.
But television can provide at short notice for luck feelings, these evaporates on a long-term basis however again.
Who hands thus an iPad to its bored child, it can divert thereby of the boredom. It did not learn however to converse or control, says professor Fenske.
And it adds: “Self-check is passed from a situation to the other one”.
The child does not only learn to converse but receives also within other ranges more self-check.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Also we should not see it too critically.
Instead our goal should consist of probably-feeling us also off the constant activity and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“It sounds, as if would have to be more frequently boring us. But boredom is the tormenting, incessant desire, to do something meaningful”, says it.
He believes that humans in truth look only for a way to switch off and relax.
“In an environment, in which we are constantly over-stimulated, it falls heavily, to be occupied, if the noise grew silent.”

In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year old Community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorado for an offence in court, which will be legal in this state already soon: The possession some fewer marijuana breaking into and a whistle, with which it smoked these.
According to Orozco were it and some friends on one September day with the car in Lamar the close border to Kansas on the way, when they were stopped.
After the police officer marijuana in the car had found, Orozco for the possession of drugs and drug implements was cited - harmless crimes, which are provided with a punishment of 100 US Dollar in each case - and received a court date.
“We are treated like criminal ones”, so Orozco.
But it is also one?
In the uncertain weeks after the resolution of the state to legalize small amounts marijuana to the own use the answer depends less with hundreds of smaller drug offenses on the law, than on the location.
Hundreds of irregularities, which turn around marijuana, are dropped here and in the State of Washington, that approved similar measures, already.
The Police Departments do not pursue adults over 21 years longer for possession in small measure. This is legally permitted, as soon as the new laws step in the next weeks into force.
But state lawyers in the more conservative districts of Colorado announced to further pursue existing marijuana crimes and quote still humans in court.
At the same time several cities co-ordinate to prevent from the suburbs Denvers up to the westerns Mountains on it, new, national licensed marijuana business from the opening in their communities.
“This situation continues to develop so fast that I do not know at all, what will next happen”, says Daniel J. Oates, Polizeichef in Aurora, which lies east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the Federal State Washington scratch themselves helpless at the head.
They wait for a guideline assistance for the facility of a license system for production, production, the selling and the sale of the drug - and have thereby one eke out by 1 December 2013 before eyes.
In Washington is one the opinion that Colorado ahead is in each case most states, which concerns the adjustment of marijuana. There the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then to the self-consumption.
“Colorado has a more strongly adjusted market. The state is suitable from there well for orientation”, says Brian E. Smith, Sprecher of the supervisory authority for liquor in the Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no more place or system can do to serve than in the sense of a rough manual.
“We do not have a genuine precedent, which we can follow”, add he.
Washington the law, called I-502, comes into force on 6 December and forms thereby also the terminal gray area, in which the national license system does not exist yet, but the possession is legalized.
And unpleasant practice questions must be clarified in this time - about, like the national default of a “appropriate entrance” too licensed marijuana with the prohibition by cannabis business in the periphery of 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and child care facilities to be agreed upon is.
“Nowhere it to be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in cities, in particular in the densely populated area of Seattle”, means Ben Livingston, spokesman for the “center for legally cannabis”, a recently educated research group.
On 21 November Chief Oates sent in Aurora an email to its employees, in which he explained, which public prosecutor would not pursue smaller marijuana crimes with persons over 21 years longer, and that the police “immediately” will aim at no charges for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police will implement further urban defaults for the adjustment of growers of medical marijuana and drug dealers were further pursued.
In Weld County in the north of Colorado represents district public prosecutor Ken Buck a stricter opinion.
After the vote it indicated, its authority cases of marijuana possession further would pursue, mainly, in order to induce consumers to the withdrawal.
Up-to-date 119 persons for the possession of approximately 50 gram must answer for themselves or fewer marijuanas in court, although many were accused also for other crimes.
“Our authority has the obligation to pursue offences with which it concerned, let to point of time of the crime criminal offences” Buck in an explanation to be reported.
The reactions are even at places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative, ambivalently.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the district, indicates adults for the possession of small amounts not longer.
District public prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, decided in addition, to it to let not all pending possession procedures fall.
“I do not believe that I mean time waste to implement the right to it change”, say he.
Although 55% the voter in Colorado supported the measure, it was already from the outset clear that it would not be simple to agree upon the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities from government and juridical system to.
And the contradictory reactions generally speaking state promoted a profound cleavage among local officials regarding the large green experiment to day.
With district state lawyers concern it a “cultural barrier”, say yourself Sean McAllister, an attorney from Denver, which represents standing accused for marijuana crimes in court and locally as a spokesman for the national organization to the reform of marijuana laws acted.
“You spent such a large part of their life to pursue persons for the fact criminally that they cannot accept the legalization yet”, believe it.
When first states, which treat small amounts marijuana such as alcohol, Colorado and Washington acted as national typical cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and civil servants prepare for one age of legal sale, they wait at the same time also nervously for instructions of the Federal Government, that wants to treat the sale and the cultivation of marijuana on federal level further as criminal offence.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice becomes giving way.
Despite several startling arrests of consumers and salespersen of medical marijuana the Federal Government permitted the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to the majority.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy advisor of the Obama government is the opinion that detective no doors will probably enter, in order to seize small amounts of the drugs, will however probably bristle, the legal under the new legislation to bear by the state adjusted marijuana business.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait only at all for the fact that the federal authorities act.
Still before the election day some local local administrations approved moratoriums for new marijuana business, although these could open only in approximately one year.
Last week decided Montrose, a city in the west, a six-month prohibition, which is adopted probably next week.
“We would not like to turn out into a position, with that we someone license and then on federal level before a large problem stand”, thus for Bob Nicholson, member of the town councillor.
Our community was correct against this law change.
We depend on for which the community decided and not after it, for which the state decided.
Still many questions are open.

Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford, because I am Tory
University students today are not only attacked for their opinions
It had always been my largest dream to receive a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I regarded once as the largest knowledge temple of the world, for modern Greek symposium, which promoted the large columns of the civilization - free thinking and tolerance -.
But within two weeks after my introduction in the Worscester college end of the eighties - there I had intended to study history - I had packed again my suit-cases and had caused so the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening standard was called it, I would have gone, because I would have had a problem thereby that fellow students in the neighbouring room had sex.
The author A N Wilson explained mischievously, I would have left the university, because I was compelling to drink from damaged cups.
The truth however was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not due to my quite unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
One had chicaned me only for a reason - a reason, which seemed in this alleged cradle of the enlightenment all the more narrow-minded and crueler: Mine meanwhile the deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I proponent the conservative of the party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Now, according to current reports a new generation suffers rights under similar pursuit, moderate by students.
The organized and rising hate on Tory students in Oxford developed meanwhile such dimensions the fact that a group of them demanded last week the same equal rights protection, which obstructed gays, and ethnic minorities benefits.
Conservative members of Junior Common Room (JCR) of the corpus Christi College indicate, them due to their political views “are isolated often actively, personally attacked and for unwanted explained”.
They demand a place in the equal rights committee their college, in order to guarantee that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was aggravated by a recently radiated documentation over political students on BBC Two, “Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the right”, which represented Tories as Exzentriker and a neo-Nazi.
In it was shown among other things graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative student combination of the University of Oxford, which drove in a Rolls-Royce and with silver suit and showed off to silver-occupied going stick.
At other universities say conservative students, it than “scapegoats for the introduction of higher study fees” are regarded.
20-year old Luke Black, Vizepräsident of the conservative student combination of the University of Nottingham, mentioned in a Sunday newspaper: “There is an increasing on the left of tendency at universities.
The people believe, we are like the Bullingdon club, without us to have at all become acquainted”.
Samuel Roberts, 21 and a historical student in Corpus Christi, which initiated the request for larger protection, is the opinion, such a climate is “unpleasant”. 19-year old Stephanie Cherill, designate president of the conservative student combination of Oxford says, with JCR members an increasing refusal observed her opposite students moderate rights.
“This represents a danger for the intellectual discourse and for the well-being of the members”, says it.
In my first weeks in Oxford I belonged to such a minority.
As unbelievably shy 18-year old I had arrived in September 1986.
The hate on the conservative a party had reached its high point.
In the previous year the university had been correct for it to lend to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - due to shortening in the university nature no honour title.
The atmosphere would have let startle even stalinists.
In the first days of the frosh week, at which new students become acquainted with themselves and the tutors, I received a foretaste on the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors did not only bear the derision of Tory students, but even with pleasure to it participated.
Political issues like the miner strike, the privatisation and the refusal of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wood-panelled areas of the Tutoriums.
With my first of these meetings I should French texts from that 18. Century into English translate. On what should come then, I had not been calm.
“Miss Wyatt”, said the tutor Harry Pitt (meanwhile died), “translates you please the first paragraph”.
I tripped thereby.
Pitt was a small man with a face as nasty from cake paste, and rather.
“Refusing itself Thatcher supporters learning French or they are simply only stupid? ”, he asked me.
The other students giggled.
In my eyes tears wallten up.
“I suggest that they take a few French hours in your spare time - thus, if you are not too much busy with your social activities, snarled at” me Pitt.
I returned with hanging head to my room.
On this evening I sat in the college alone during dinner, when someone typed me easily on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James, which introduced itself as member of the conservative student combination.
“I know, who you are”, said he friendly.
Unfortunately is it, as it is.
Everyone, which is suspected to be Tory is oppressed.
For me it is already bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is close, therefore it for you will be worse.
Most Tory froshes give to be supporters of the labour party.
In a local pub I tried later to adjust me.
I insisted on the fact that I not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher of an opinion was.
This trick should prove as unsuccessful.
A first-year university student in the subject philosophy, politics and economy, which ironically as conservatively valid Eton the college had visited, said to me: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig”.
You are dirty.
Other students divided his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
“As Tories have sex? ”, one asked me.
Those strike themselves mutually, or?
I felt in such a way, as homosexuals before the more liberal legislation of the United States must have felt.
Would I succeed ever to lead at the University of Oxford a normal life?
Could I meet like-minded ones only after dark?
Should I to the labour party turn and my natural inclinations to suppress have?
The three years, which lay before me, stretched before my mental eye to a purgatory of the proscription and the isolation.
The only tutor, who gave to recognize each other openly as Tory, was Norman Stone, professor for contemporary history, which had his seat in my college.
To be hated it not only for it, a conservative, but also, because he had advised Thatcher in things foreign policy and had written for her speeches.
Only rarely there it was.
He hated the place, found him to provincial and narrow-minded and rejected him for its Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
1997 it accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
“You will become not happy here”, said he to me.
I began to oscillate between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refuge with more unlocked friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
It seemed disbelieving.
While its time in the 40s all political views were accepted.
“However it is the best place in the world”, said it sheepish.
Something like that they would never do, not in my city to that dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends put always perfect manners to the day.
Its damp eyes clouded themselves.
Give to the whole one an opportunity.
I am safe, one neckt you only.
It would break the heart to me, if you went.
By my frequent journeys to London my emotional resistance became exhausted more weakly.
One of my male friends, Tory supporters, had likewise given way to the pressure and its convictions had renounced.
During a Tutoriums in the following week, with which a further historical tutor had seriously stated, I am “an enemy of the people”, decided I, the same to do.
Although I melted secretly before shame, I added that my parents of a “brainwashing” had submitted me, and called them “old nincompoops”.
The relief persisted only briefly.
It was my father, who struck the last nail into the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time wrote it per week two columns in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes gave up my Hä.
When they went, I packed a suit-case and took the first course to London.
I never returned.
Gladly you can call a tearful wimp me.
But no 18-year old should have ever in an educational facility under such intimidation and wickedness suffering.
And it is still tragic that it was Oxford - a university, which did not only bring 14 Tory prime ministers out, but until today behind an undeserved call of equal rights and freedom of thought hides themselves.

“Valentino draws elegance of celebrity forwards”
On the occasion of the exhibition “Valentino - master of the Couture”, which this week in London was opened, speaks ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customer of the Italian mode doer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of the accomodation of an exhibition over Valentino Garavani.
This recognized the designer with the opening of “Valentino - masters of the Couture”, a magnificent retrospective, for which more than 130 dresses of the haute couture were arranged, which were created by its “Maison” in the last 50 years.
“I love this palace”, say he with its unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a history, whose only protagonist “IL is signore” Garavani, which could not have been written however without its distinguished clientele.
Valentino always already felt fascination for the stuffy and far world of the aristocracy.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will have to be seen still by 3 March, there is a variety at private letters and photo with the signature of the most exquisite aristocracy, begun from the princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England up to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino points these personal memories as trophies of its social ascent of the modest mode doer in the city Voghera in north Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
With the aristocracy falls in love to be, does not have to be not from disadvantage.
“At least they do not withdraw their dumps on your wonderful carpet, like it some beautiful famousnesses from the pop music do”, say baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In and the 70's 60's the two lived in the alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
“We all made us happy, if we were invited into its house into Gstaad”, explain the ex-wife of “Heini” Thyssen, closely friendly with forgotten beauties like e.g. Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino always already preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And it is a star nevertheless.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the mode doer.
Many years ago we went to a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna into Rome to him home with dinner.
We were approximately 20 persons, among them also Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
By each detail of its apartment, the decoration, by the meal and at the music and felt one recognized its influence.
“All invitations felt importantly and loved”, remember the “Top model”, which began their career at the week of the haute couture 1995 in Paris.
“He never comes from the mode, because its designs of works of art are” say them finally.
Fashion show of the origin
The life of Garavani is not history of obsessedness, rather from mutual affairs.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was transformed into a glorious and 60 meter long gangway, which suggests an exchange of roles: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the gangway, in order to admire a fantastic “audience”, which carries masterpieces of Valentino, as for example the dress, which selected Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes, which Monica Vitti carried in “La Notte”, or a coat from wool and leather, to which belonged to the empress Farah Diba.
In this audience from mode dolls names radiate as from Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn and Taxis, Mette Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the mode doer, 2006
Many of these customers say, which is first Valentino like the first love, “unforgettably”.
I can remember still perfectly.
It was trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat type “Gillette” and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift of it”, says Naty Abascal, one the Musen of the designer.
“I pull it to all different because of its large love for the women and because he emphasizes our beauty, forwards”, the ex-duchess of Feria adds.
I like the colors, which he uses, very much; they have much light and to underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion-prominent with the mode Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time, when she carried a Valentino.
When I lived as teenager in Italy, I dreamed to finally have the age and the opportunity one of its evening gowns to carry…
End of the 90's was added it then finally.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a celebration in the lock of my cousin, the prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying skirt and a draped upper section with a decollete, which makes honour for its name.
“It was a truely become dream”, says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino does not depend on the mode, its obsession is timeless”, describes this Italian aristocrat, which lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening gowns of the mode doer “with absolute care”, “because a dress not only a dress is, but also the associated memories”.
The “king” the mode
The large final of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Pablo de Grecia in the year 1995.
Four months work and 25 “Ragazze” (like the mode doer called its sewers) were necessary, in order this elfenbeinfarbene silk dress with beads, twelve different embroideries and four and one-half meters are enough for tail to make.
According to the lady journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the technical literature, was this dress a milestone in the haute couture end the 20. Century, “the return to the customers of the highest society”.
For many years with “savoir être” of the elite clouded, is Valentino now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honor of Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre the kinds et the Lettres, excellently with the Legion of Honour, cumulates to Garavani so many honours, like everyone of the husbands of its customers.
“Always its Raffinement, its peace, its maintained and perfect exterior was noticeable to me”, admits D'Arenberg.
I saw it the last mark one month ago with a gala dinner in the museum de Orsay.
It sat at the table of countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
“It was immaculate; the time does not leave traces at it”.
And this says a princess…

The most difficult occupation of the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their life and their health, if they carry 70 Kilos sulfur over the steep, stony ways.
There are humans, for whom their work is hell, and others work word by word in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers, who earn themselves their life, by getting sulfur from the volcano Kawah Ijen in the east of the Indonesian island Java.
In addition it must rise each day down to the ground of its crater, where sulfurous gas in the contact with air, the leaking out the earth, solidifies itself.
After it knocked out large sulfur stones, which can weigh altogether up to 70 Kilos, it transports them in two bamboo baskets on its shoulders over the sloping paths from stone.
There is only 250 meters up to the point of the volcano, which rises into a height from 2386 meters, but the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the ascent in the turtle speed, whereby them the balance to keep and carefully must set their steps, so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that each step can cost their life, as this happened to a French tourist, who fell years ago at the steep rock slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocent for each Kilo sulfur, which they reduce.
Arrived above, they clear the way between the tourists, them like circus apes photograph themselves and run with that fatiguing heavy baskets of three kilometers up to the balance, which set up a mine company a little further down on a height of 1850 meters
The society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which uses the occurrences in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocent) since 1960 for each Kilo sulfur.
It sells then for 10,000 rupees each (83 eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in the everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“There we normally 70 kg carry, receive we for each way approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros)”, explain to us Anto, which makes under normal conditions three distances on the day.
For each distance it needs three hours, according to which he is completely creative, in the end the day has got together it however then 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros).
Which like miserable wages for such an almost inhuman effort looks, is however the three-way of what he would earn with the farm work.
“Daily wages of the mine workers here, where with the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid on the day and the average monthly income amounts to two million rupees (167 euros), are very high”, describe the carrier, which worked before as a bricklayer on the tourist island Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with its family to Banyuwangi, a village in the proximity, and from a reason, which is as important in Indonesia as the sulfur: “I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hinduisten, and I brought them after Java, around them to the Islam to convert”.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and its eyes is attractive because of the poisonous gases.
The 27-year old Anto sets its life at the Kawah Ijen for three years on the play, whose sulfur already left the first traces with it, although it covers its face with a mask and special eyeglasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and its eyes is attractive because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price, which he must pay for reaching his dream.
“I will work here still two years, because I open a shop or”, promises he would like to learn Spanish or French in one more than only acceptable English.
This pleasant and intelligent, but young man punished by the life could work as a tourist leader, waiter or on the receipt of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a carrying donkey.
It divides a dirty cabin with other carriers and rises each morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur leaks out also at night, where its characteristic yellow color in the darkness shines bluish.
The shade provocatively, he rises in the light of a small head lamp at his helmet, which he bought from his own money, into the crater.
Approximately 400 carriers load themselves at the crater ground the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders.
Despite its large profits the mine company did not mechanize the sulfur dismantling, in order to save costs, and supplies with to the carriers, which work on own bill and are paid after weight, no equipment.
They receive also no portion of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) to addition per camera, which the guards of this nature park as well as the admission fee at a value of 15.000 rupees (1.2 euros) require of the tourists, who come to photographing the volcano and the human carrying donkeys.
“This work is for the animals and not for humans” protests to Madrusin, a born, 42 years old carrier, which works three decades since leaving the school on the Kawah Ijen.
It is able to carry as far as 110 kg and insured that he continues, “so long it goes”, because he needs the money for the education of his three children at the age between 10 and 18 years.
I will go not into pension, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and it itches the eyes if the wind suddenly turns and gets jammed the mine workers in the thick columns, which ascend from the crater, the men are so hard that nobody complains about serious diseases… naturally except the usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders, which deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on its back Unainik is with its 53 years only more able to carry 50 kg.
Break each day it and its companions 15 tons sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks over a goat path between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers distance.
“I will go not into pension, I will die here, because the volcano was my whole life” explains Unainik, whereby it opens its mouth far, in which some teeth is missing.
From its five children the oldest one works with its 30 years also as sulfur carrier.
The time passes, but the miserableness stops generation on generation in one of the hardest occupations of the world: that, which works as human load donkeys on the Kawah Ijen.

Singapore needs babies for the rescue of the economy
The singaporeans lay the blame for it that they do not have children, on the career, the stress and the costs of the real estate and children's education.
“The population of Singapore must grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you am my patriotic wife: We fulfill our civil duty and create we lives!
It appears unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but nevertheless - or straight therefore - they became at the beginning of this year in Singapore a viral video on YouTube.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local of sayings like e.g. “Pushing will one “bao” (loaf) into the furnace, in order to make itself over the low birth rate in Singapore hilariously.
The advertising company BBH, which turned the video, protects hope that the advertising spots in hilarious way reached, on the problem to make attentive.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of the music to bring the people to it its “national obligation” fulfills.
This is somewhat only for the Internet, therefore we had to arrange it hilariously and funny.
This concerns the largest problem in this country.
With reproducing we are the worst ones of the world, therefore we that it concerns a topic, noticed around which we to worry had.
We e.g. knew that the government had tried much, like the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed Dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possible that many of these ideas were creative, they did not lead however compellingly to success.
Therefore we thought: Why don't we make somewhat as creative as possible to how e.g. compose in order to concern this problem, a RAP?
1.2 children
Who does not take this topic easily, is the government of Singapore.
Each year spends it 1,300 US Dollar on political measures, in order to suggest the citizens to get more children.
A package of the government for married couples and parents granted up to 15,000 dollar per child, extends the maternity leave and distributes fiscal advantages.
But everything had so far little success.
Singapore is enriches, high-technological city state in the southeast of Asia, which admits also for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls is.
In accordance with its national population authority the birth rate is at present about 1,2 children per woman.
The last mark, when this rate over 2 amounted to - which admits actual also as replacement rate was in the year 1976.
Thus why don't the singaporeans any more children get?
Tan Wei Ming, directress for before and family policy of the national population authority, says that this improves training” and “larger career opportunities” on “to be led back is.
“This made humans to marry and a family form except substantially for more options possible regarding purposes in life to have and priorities set”, explains it.
These changes in the social conditions contributed to the higher number at singles and at delaying the marriage and births, whose result is the decrease of the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile an immigration policy, which aims at a drastic rise of immigrations, in order to work against the decrease of the population, led to resentment with the local population.
In Singapore there are web pages, where hardly covered xenophobia flowers against many new immigrants, particularly against the Chinese, who are criticized for the fact that they keep the wages low and do not integrate themselves.
The rise of immigration is regarded also as one of the reasons for the fact that the government party in Singapore obtained last year their worst election result since independence.
Since the elections an attempt was undertaken to correct the problem with higher contributions and deliveries for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate the well-known effects on the economic growth of a nation, the tax revenues, which has health costs and the immigration policy, the example Singapore shows also unexpected consequences.
The government tries to reach that so many small apartments are not built.
So it has already also effects on the housing market.
The authority for urban development began to check the number at small apartments which admit as “shoe boxes” are and in certain areas of the city be built may.
These apartments have a floor space of 46 square meters and to show a large sales impact.
However the concern exists that they can promote the lifestyle the singles, and that they deter the building firms to build large apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its “shoe boxes” can be sold very many faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are around days and even weeks faster sell off than the larger housing units.
This leads to the fact that they are very much better for our cash flow.
It admits however that the new standards give clearer orientations, to which before obstacles were put into the way to the developers, if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to a rise of the national birth rate, the discussions with the singaporeans, which are in the financial quarter work, to infer that they will not have large effect.
“The people are stressed strongly, the apartments and also the education are expensive, why it is postponed by many” says a young manager.
The children can get others.
“For me it is important, over my own money and time to order” says another, approximately twenty years old man.
Men and women would start their career, the stress and the costs of the property and the education as reasons for the fact that they cannot have children.
Therefore the singaporeans have the final say, if it concerns, children to get - there the government can do still so much.

The off-line private one off-line is on-line privately
Privacy
In accordance with the dictionary it concerns thereby the characteristic privately or “that range of the private life, where one has requirement on protection from each kind of interference”.
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers, to which he exposes himself, if he admits situations makes, which he would not divide in the material life in the Internet?
El Periódico interviewed five young people at the age between 10 and 15 years, which are frequent in the net on the way.
In four of the cases they linked the term with “somewhat very own” on personal level and “on the password and the user”, if they used it on the social networks.
“My deepest secrets I would not announce in a post office” say the 10 years old Jorge with the attempt, the meaning of “privately” in web pages such as Facebook, Twitter, to explain Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger where it has for two years accounts.
“Those are very confidential secrets, my mother may them, but not, he confirms the whole world”.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from plays.
I drive myself out also my time with acquaintance.
“I would not divide a photo, which is not from me, or of someone, that the fool makes” says he.
The boy is itself over it in the clear one that it is wrong, obscene photos, to write of naked ones, to publish from crimes to or insulting or comments by force.
Jorge insures to know 35 friends whom it has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are used.
Among them also the mother, that has the password to one of the accounts.
I registered at Twitter, in order to express me and write interesting Tweets.
“I white, whether someone answers me, I do not load it only highly” add it.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can fast with relatives in the distance or with friends speak” indicate he.
Asked it answers that he would never accept an invitation of unknown quantities.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to it, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year old José lies differently.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My space and Ask. In Ask it admits not to know 20 of the persons whom it added its friend list.
“Not, because we have somewhat in common, for example music” frightens me, indicates it.
According to the boy nobody made suggestions for it or asked it for its address or telephone number.
“If someone me pressed or her of me required, I remove him simply from my user account” admit he.
José announced itself to Ask, after he had read a recommendation in Twitter.
Experiences are not unknown to the boy, which one knows today as Cyberbullying.
The acquaintance of a friend was extorted in a social network.
They threatened it and required money.
“It never experienced, who it was”, insures it.
According to José the victim did not close the user account.
“It made it only private.”
Afterwards it describes a set of steps, in order to configure a user account surely.
In contrast to Jorge this boy would upload photos from acquaintance in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, which I would do, if it is me unsympathetic or I want to wipe it one out.
“However I know that this Cyberbullying is” explains he.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, Lehrerin for English with university conclusion in education and learning, means that around the children and young people to orient, be understood it must that it is purpose of the social networks, to inform.
“The Internet developed as medium for the search for information; with the appearance of these sides the rules changed however”, say them.
Porras describes that the university graduate Marc Prensky, Inhaber of a master title in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work formed “digitally native and immigrant” these terms to the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital native are they, the children and young people, which grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants, who are to teach them, where we still learn nevertheless” say it.
It explained that it concerns a complex topic, “because we of them require that they have a defined criterion over it, what may be spread, published or said, and this at an age, where the ripe one for it is not sufficient.”
“You should be also discriminating, if it is them at the most important one, like to be, thousands friends to have, without over the consequences to think”, add it.
According to the specialist the most effective way is to teach the children and young people what privacy is, them questions to place, which it brings to thinking.
“To you to say, her are it not to do, functioned not”, do not say he.
Porras calls afterwards some possibilities: There are things, which you would not tell to a stranger. Why do you make it then in the Internet?
Or: Would it please you, if one publishes a photo of you, how that, which you published from a friend?
Do you know, what the others publish over you?
Did you ask the other persons before for permission, if you labeled photos of celebrations?
And still another question: Do all have to know, what you do in each moment?
A further point is to give to understand them that they must act on-line, as they do it to off-lines.
There is the same rules.
“Someone outside of the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must be valid for the social networks”, explains it.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, basic school teacher and educational advisor, commentates that it indispensably that parents the guidelines of the social networks read carefully.
If they understand all sections, they have solid bases, in order to talk with their children about the meaning of opening one user account in the Internet.
“For example the age, or which one may divide or publish” explains he.
According to Guardia the children to the lesson “you must are not with strangers to speak” to be reminded.

Conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the explanation by Lima
The 6th summit of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the explanation of Lima, which was announced before and theoretically by the seven present governments should be signed.
Efe tried repetitive to attain entrance to the signed document with the VITH tidy meeting of the state and government heads of the Unasur. Sources in the state and president chancellery communicated at first that they were handed over it after the examination, explained after the fact however that it was published at certain time on the web page of the Peruvian government.
For questions to the text indicated it that contents of president of Peru, were stated Ollanta Humala, with brief statements to the press.
The entrance of the journalists to the information about the summit was limited at each time.
During the day in the press area only the picture of the president meeting without tone with the message “private meeting, limited audio” was transferred.
The few information, which circulated under the journalist, was received from the press spokesmen of some of the governments of the Unasur, but not of the Peruvian press spokesman, present when meeting.
The only document, which was spread during the day, was the list of the participating presidents, which caused journalists of different national and international media uneasiness with the hundreds, which demanded more information.
Afterwards the presidential office of Peru would send an email with the “final declaration” of the summit to the media, whereby it concerned however the explanation of Humala and not around the official document for the conclusion of the summit.
In past October Peru Gastgeber of the IIITH summit South America was - Arab States of (ASPA), and also on this occasion despite serious request by the press the so-called explanation by Lima, which one had announced before, just as few was published.
On the official web page of the ASPA one can make sure of the fact that the document was published on past Tuesday.
At both international meetings the Peruvian authorities that the information systems for the journalists would be present, stressed it limited however a high degree the entrance to the information.
The summit ended also with the common obligation of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Court of Justice of the Hague which settles a border conflict between both countries.
Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins on Monday into the Hague, during the process, which Lima introduced against Santiago, the final speech of both sides to listen to.
“We will obey and would drive, said the judgement out over the differences, which we state at present this International Court of Justice,” Humala as well as its Chilean opposite.
“Chile was, is and remains also further a country, which adheres to the international laws, peaceful solutions for disputes searches, agreements closes and to the International Courts of Justice submits”, adds Piñera and greeted Humala with a handshake before the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would be subjected to the IGH, took place, after Colombia had raised complaint after a decision over the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it regarded as a heavy error, against the agreement from Bogotá, where it agreed, to submit to the judgements of this International Court of Justice.
With the summit presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, from Bolivia, Evo Morales, and from Argentina, Cristina Kirchner were present.
Paraguay, which is impossible since 2011 after the joggle of his president Fernando Lugo from the Unasur, did not participate in the meeting.
Guest-giving president Ollanta Humala opened the discussions in the morning and terminated the summit shortly after the midday in Lima.
The head of state read out the conclusion document, where it communicated that 16 resolutions were met and the action lines were specified for 31 projects between the South American countries over an amount of investment by altogether 17 billion dollar.
To the met resolutions he said that the countries of the Unasur will undertake “important steps toward the goal of a South American nationality, to which we expand the resolutions over unlimited rights to residence.”
It communicated that measures were advanced, in order “co-operation in the fight against the uncertainty in the cities and against the organized, landspreading crime to improve, as well as to measures, to improve and together and efficiently act over in the case of natural disasters over the entrance to medicines and to the Internet to low prices in all areas of South America”.
With the crisis in Europe may “the economic consolidation (in Latin America) no triumphing courses assume, but is serve to expand and our peoples a better future point our output out”, added Humala.
“We decided to give to a set of 31 emblematic projects the priority which are particularly to improve the spatial connections in South America and in rural and border areas… and thus to unite and new economic forms open”, the Peruvian president in a read out explanation said our countries.
Under these projects would be also five Peruvian, which would be on the transverse axes of its area from the coast to Brazil, and about which two are to provide for a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not give further details.
Likewise the conclusion document referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the choice procedure in this country for its resumption in the union of South American nations serves”, from which it is excluded at present.
The necessity that Latin America remains also further an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighborly relations, was a further aspect, which was stressed on the summit.
In this sense the president said Juan Manuel Santos, before beginning of his participation at the regional meeting of Colombia, that he on Saturday in Mexico a meeting with its opposite of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, expected, in order to treat the maritime conflict after a judgement of the IGH placed by Bogotá in question respectfully.
“Possibly I will meet on the tomorrow's day (Saturday) with president Daniel Ortega”, said myself Santos.
“We will examine all these ways - they are not excluding, and also discussions with Nicaragua make, underlined the agreement with Nicaragua necessary” it.
“I hope to be able to say Ortega to the president the fact that we this affair so civilized and respectfully as will possible treat”, added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they have the intention, with the taking office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto, to be present.
As part of the summit the Secretaries of Defense of the block met for the adoption of the measure plan for the year 2013 also before, where the dialogue and consent were to be strengthened regarding the defense of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members with the UNASUR, even if the latter country is impossible at present.

“South America must learn with the integration of the citizens”, says Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common nationality is a goal, whereby “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, which in the 6th summit of the presidents of the union of South American nations (Unasur) participated, which took place in Lima, explained to the national television in Peru the fact that the Europeans killed themselves “in the Second World War and in other arguments” and “today practically a native country is.”
In this sense it defended the project to create a South American nationality which the member states of the Unasur advance.
“To be reached the free traffic of the citizens and workers in all South American countries must, how this is already in the Andes community the case; there is however still reactionary sectors, which aim at, warned a return into the past” it.
In addition president Ecuadors endorsed the reorganization of the organization of American States of (OEA) under the default to reduce the influence of the anglo-saxon states and consider those, which signed the agreement of San José over human rights.
Those, which teach, never commit themselves to something, and in response to it we always sign the south Americans everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the inter+American commission for human rights has its seat in Washington and by the United States is financed”, explained it as allusion on the political asylum, which granted Ecuador the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa insured the fact that he do not regret this decision, because he did not betray thereby his principles, but followed his “deep democratic values and opinions over human rights”.
It added that it had given at that time “justified assumptions that Assange was not kept to a third country delivered and its procedure.”
In addition he criticized the Swedish law, which had required those of him to submit him on its national territory to a questioning because of an alleged sexual crime while “the Swedish jurisdiction permits this by means of a video conference, over the message of Ecuador in London have been implemented could.”
Correa explained that the danger would exist that the health and the psychological condition of Assange were impaired.
“Since then it in our message is, I with it did not speak, which ambassador has me however informed that he has an easy problem with the lungs, but no serious” said, the head of state of Ecuador.
There is however the danger that he would take physical and psychological damage, because he was imprisoned in a close area and no physical exercises in the free one would drive through can.
“That would impair, added the health of each humans” it.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, which was granted to Assange since the month June in the message of Ecuador in London was the grant of a charter, with which it can travel to Ecuador, and that this would lie in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities Europa's. It underlined that it had given discussions with London, in order to find a solution for the locked up founder from WikiLeaks to.
We do not act with the human rights, this word do not use we for this case, it however constant discussions gave.
“The solution for this problem lies in hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, leads, explained Baltazar Garzón, a set of procedures on different European instances” he.
And “if Great Britain morning this charter granted, is in my opinion settled this.”
And if Sweden Mr. Assange on the message of Ecuador in London or over Skype cross-examined, as it permits and in other cases was made the Swedish jurisdiction, is settled the problem.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm around itself as defenders of freedom of the press and said that what it does not tolerate “those weaken the mediocrity, which is bad intention and the lie the free expression of opinion.”
“The largest enemies of freedom of the press are not the bad and perverted politicians, but bad journalists, who strive for profit and extort, said” he.
In this sense he congratulated himself that Ecuador no more by such journalists is also not controlled “and by the bankers or hegemonic and skewer-civil countries”, and anticipated that it will deepen the revolution with a re-election “, around the way into this right direction to continue.”
Correa supported also the decision to maintain the veto at least against Paraguay in the Unasur up to its next elections whereby it argued the fact that the organism must remain hard “and as legally disguised coup d'etat may allow to no opportunism and none”, because thereby “the legitimacy of the democracy in Paraguay was destroyed.”
In addition president Ecuadors regards the desire of his Colombian Gegenübers to negotiate Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgement of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which gave preference to the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, with Nicaragua the sea-legal borders between both countries as “absolutely entitled.”
At present this judgement is not converted.
This concerns a problem between a south and a Central American state.
Conflicts are unavoidable, them must however in striving for a common way be overcome.
They must be treated comprehensively, so that one can overcome and look them forward.
Likewise he trusted in a good conclusion of the disputes over the sea-borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and meant that “it is correct for Latin America, to call international instances if itself both countries obligate to accept the judgement even if it very hard fails.”
Regarding the possibility that he places himself as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to reach its third mandate in consequence, it indicated that he sees this possibility “with much optimism and joy, although it falls sometimes also very heavily.”
Correa insured that, if he lost the elections in February 2013 he would withdraw himself from the political life.
Power personally never interested me, but under as unfair circumstances as in Ecuador this socio-economic poverty can be corrected only by political power.
“My political movement had the faith that I was it, this probable victory guaranteed, therefore I must follow this responsibility”, said he.
If I should win, it would be my last period as a president, afterwards I withdraw myself from the public life.
This is valid also, if we lose.
“That is decided”, explained it.
Correa took also on the treatment of the health problems of the president of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba purchase.
I spoke straight with the vice-president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He said to me the fact that he traveled for a planned, routine treatment there, and that was expected that it can travel after the election campaign again to Cuba.
“, He commentated it meant in no case a relapse in the state of health of president Chávez”.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the 6th summit of the heads of state and government of the union of South American nations (Unasur), which was terminated with the call to a higher regional integration, in order for a lasting progress, equality and a security to provide.

A cause for dying because of AIDS is today a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old, when one confirmed the test result: HIV positively.
“It was, as if a bomb hit”, says it over the moment, in which it received the diagnosis, the physician without recognizable success “to weaken tried”.
He hid it before his family.
It decided to worry alone about its illness and began to inform about it; and this with such employment that it straight its 43. Birthday celebrated.
It is without a doubt one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit the hospital of the civil de Guadalajara (HCG), into whom he came to several fights 1994.
Fabrizio lives many doubts, few possibilities of treatment and more Stigmata with the human Immundefizienz virus (HIV) for 22 years, which at the beginning of the 90's was with difficulty conceivable, as it gave.
At that time it avoided the director of a hospital of the IMSS to say good-bye “because it into a dead end led.”
At that time AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However still many persons come into the hospital, which know nothing from their illness and with those the virus already damage arranged and their immune system exhausted, and which are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after occurance of first reported cases, “large success meant today that surviving a patient, who takes up the treatment in time, and which surviving the general population is accurately alike”, explained the director/conductor of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, whereby he said that this information had been supported in the April of this year of a respected scientific publication.
The specialist for infections and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commentated that the scientists concluded since the year 2008 that AIDS was no death sentence that however would depend the years of surviving and the quality of life on the degree of the impairment of the immune system of the persons with beginning of the treatment, and that those larger opportunities would have, who are not drug dependent: up to 30 years with a counting of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a counting of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above report that, who HIV positively receives the diagnosis at the age from 25 years in this sense “it can become problem-free 75 years old, means so long it under control stands”, explained this specialist.
In order to be able to arrange this progress correctly, it must be reminded of the fact that the life expectancy of the Mexicans amounts to today on the average 76 years.
Even if the number of deaths were importantly reduced in the past years (in Mexico has itself the number of the persons, who die at AIDS, from 6.678 cases in the year 2007 on 4.862 in the year 2011 (annual report of the ONUSIDA) it reduces), it is nevertheless correct that since the appearance of AIDS 60 percent of the patients seized in the national database died.
However in Jalisco 2011 255 persons died in the year, and up to the month May of this year there is already 187 deaths; however it is insured that there is universal access to the anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why thus still do humans die to it?
- In my opinion the problem is not the entrance to the treatment.
This is my opinion, and like that is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years we did not have supply problems with the medicines. The problem is that the persons come in condition progressed far, because they do not know their infection condition, i.e. in very late phases of the illness.
It makes a striking statement: “Nine of ten patients come to us, if they have already an accompanying infection. To be able in order global number of deaths to affect, are earlier diagnoses necessary, why solid recognition test must be offered to all persons, with whom this is necessary.”
This proposal tune the specialists and the official of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida EN Jalisco (Coesida) (national committee to AIDS avoidance in Jalisco) and also the patients such as Fabrizio too, which would drive through its test with a private laboratory let, and this for the only reason, because it had made a friend of it, who was already despite its recent age in the AIDS phase and even the kaposi's sarcoma (a cancer-like tumor) had, which one of the usual complications is.
Everything is different, if you know that you have AIDS.
Some it think for hearing that they will die, and would like nothing.
“If I to die must, then rather three times burst”, say one in my case.
The change was for improvement, I nourishes themselves well, drives sport and takes the medicines.
Today its parents know only that it had cancer.
I live a normal life, like every different one also.
“I work, undertake much, have an active, but responsible sex life, I pays attention to my health and those the other person”, counts Fabrizio up, which agreed, its intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to divide, in order to animate with its certification those, which have fear today in the context of the world-wide AIDS day.
They should make the test, if they belong to the risk group. Ever in former times they know, whether they are HIV positive, so much the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, is to learn them, how one can live like all humans responsibly.
Its message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in the year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Between the health programs and the simple citizen large holes exist, explain Ricardo Salazar, Journalist from Guadalajara, which took care of the thing of the HIV.
And the most important is the prevention.
At the places intended for it “the distribution of condoms was actually increased; in former times it separately delivered, now give it to us packages too with hundred pieces, which is already good, it gives however still humans, who do not have an entrance to a condom”, said it.
Among the risk persons for new infections the young people rank.
“To which do you need those?” if a common mockery question of social workers, orientation personnel in schools, is employee in pharmacies and in the health system, to who young people would not like themselves to expose, the correspondent insured.
It struck forwards to orient this inefficient distribution again; the condoms are to be not only behind the counter, but in output devices in public toilets of facilities, which are visited frequently by young people.
Promiscuity is not to be promoted.
The beer and motel are not to be paid to them, as the governor Emilio González answered to the question whether under its administration condoms would be distributed.
“Sexuality does not look so; at the best one it is to bring the condoms to those more near which already exercise, brought a sexual activity” it on the point.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is national seen at 4th place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and because of 13. Place regarding HIV.
92% of the cases of infection are made by sexual intercourse, 6% by means of the blood and 2% perinatal.
It becomes estimated that 50,000 persons with HIV live, because there are 4 or 5 persons, who do not know it for each registered case.

After the court of appeal of the United States confirmed a judgement, which does not recognize the restructuring of the commitments of the group of Vitro, which were reached by means of a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, a disastrous precedent for each national enterprise with addresses in the neighboring country is created, which has payment problems.
One could say thus that the procedures for surviving the enterprises, which permit the Mexican laws in the country the star do not have and Stripes in the contradiction to international agreements validity.
In practice on 15 June the acknowledgment of the judgement which was issued leads by the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas to the fact that the Mexican enterprises are helplessly exposed to the seizure of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However the resolution opens door and gate for the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico, in order to call because of three inconsistencies the highest Court of Justice of the United States.
While the judge of the thing points out that the creditors must be subject to the law of bankruptcy of the United States, says the court of appeal of the Fifth Circuit with seat in new Orleans first that it concerns with the main trial the commercial bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first item would mean that the international cooperation in procedures does not admit with inability to pay of enterprises with landspreading profile is.
For this purpose the model law of the United Nations for the standardization of the international trade law was actually created, whereby the American Law institutes was used as mediator.
Secondly the judgement determines that without the voices of the societies after acknowledgment of the commitments in the bankrupt's estate, which the branches of Vitro with their parent company had the necessary majority for the restructuring of the commitments would not have been reached.
However this possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
Vitro is not actual the first case, with which this pattern became certified.
There is a half dozen of examples, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose commitments under enterprises of the group were confirmed by the Instituto federal one de Concursos Mercantiles (Bundesinstitut for commercial bankruptcy).
It is in addition correct that after departure of the voices of the branches the creditors of Vitro, the creditors, who complained with the courts of the United States against Vitro i.e. the vulture funds like e.g. Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, majority would not have reached.
The vote would have gone out 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not considered by the court of appeal.
On the other hand there is Vitro debt for its difficult situation starting from 2008 in the context of the large economic crisis in the United States, which gave impacts to the country.
For this reason the family inserts González Sada before the same court of appeal contradiction, so that the vote takes place in the plenum, i.e. from all judges, because only three of it co-ordinated.
One does not allow to that, the cerium CIO rare objection is inserted, which demands the examination of the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the highest Gerichtshof of the United States.
The serious at this case is that the court let a document aside, which was sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the court), where the procedure accomplished by Vitro is described in the context of the law over commercial bankruptcy, and where is pointed out that it had adhered strict to the agreements signed by both countries, in order to correspond to chapter 15 of the bankruptcy law of the United States.
In addition it is pointed out that the country was subjected to the principles of the commission of the United Nations for the international trade, i.e. the fixed rules for the cases of transnational inability to pay, which guarantees the equality of debtor and creditors.
Zweibandige Karambole: an impact for Vitro and for the country.
General balance
After the announcements came by the Mexican trade unions for air traffic against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, which is accused of a fraudulent administration, several months not forward, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (federation of trade unions of the pilots) made finally progress.
The request stated by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now a criminal procedure against the national bank and security commission one submits, to the handicap of the law one accuses.
Afterwards the supervisory authority refused systematically informing the head office of the republic about a transaction accomplished by the entrepreneur in order to take off from the trust account F/589 of the bank IXE on the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These means were used for the acquisition by shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel administration).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the principal shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Dragon Mart is encircles
With a meeting on the weekend on a forum of the university of the Caribbean a group national and foreign environmentalists, university graduates, decided entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society the creation spreading of a front in order to oppose the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of an enormous sales and sales center in Mexico, central America and the Caribbean with products of the country beyond the wall, supplements around a living area for the employees of 150 enterprises.
Before the Canacintra (the national chamber of the processing industry) reached to unite the governors in the southeast in order to oppose the monumental facility, which destroyed partially protected areas and which mother of all threats of the industry represents.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of an inquiry of the senate to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the anti Counterfeiting trade Agreement, which admits ACTA under the English abbreviation is, the affair did not follow in accordance with Mexican Institut for intellectual property was already archived.
How you know, these measures took place, although the senate had drawn the possibility except consideration, because he regarded it as offence against the free expression of opinion in the social networks.
Homex on a long-term basis
In striving to pay long-term commitments without impairment of the short term commitments brings the building contractor Homex of stock exchange certificates over 500 million pesos on the market.
The emission is first of four equal emissions, which promise an interest payment every 28 days.

Héctor “Hetin” Reyes: “Basketball was my life”
The globetrotter of the basketball, Héctor “Hetin” Reyes, was longer than 60 years connected for the basket haven and the whole world visited.
Few in Puerto Rico have a as large mental collection of the history of the basketball of the country as Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Before it was bound by an apoplexy in the year 2008 to the wheelchair, Rexes was 6 years long part of this sport, was it as a player of lower classes, players of the first national league, authorized persons and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or Präsident of the basketball federation.
“My life I put in the basketball many hats long, even several at the same time, as I president of the BSN, managing director of the national team and a president of the federation in the 90's was”, remembered to Reyes on with a visit of Primera Hora with him at home in Bayamón, where he with Isabel, its faithful wife lives for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of its house are decorated nearly all with photos and memories of its long career and testify them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those, which remind of its time with the Vaqueros of the center of the 50's as players to 1982, where it celebrated its 15-year old anniversary as joint manager or a managing director of the club.
“That were my best years, which I had enjoyed at most, because I am part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 it as a managing director, joint manager or coach could be.
Were many fulfilling years, including the five championships successively from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said good-bye with a championship 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy with BSN.
Off then took over “Cuco” Ortiz, which was a very good manager”, says Reyes.
I know still that me Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed on the university of Alabama (Birmingham), said: “I have very strong and 2 m a large player.
Would you like it?”
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, who had Puerto Rico ever.
Bartow recommended thereafter the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who let himself nationalize and one of our best throwers was.
I know still, how he said that, if Mincy had made a championship possible for Bayamon gau SSE would provide for a further.
The championship of the Vaqueros with gau SSE was granted to it, but already from a distance, because it stood already for 1988 in highest place of the federation.
At this time it preferred it to enjoy its enforcement and from Mincy in the national team.
I know still, when we won for the first time with the before-olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA.
Afterwards the world championship came 1990, with which we reserved the fourth seat, what bronze have been actually should, if not this Canadian arbitrator had been, who let us repeat the last play course for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the world championship 1990 the best national team, which you saw ever?
It belongs to the best ones, how also that one, which won with the Olympiad 2004 against the Dream team.
My favorite is however the crew of the Pan-American plays 1991 in Cuba, where we won gold and to the team of the USA a fight offered, like at that time, when they won against us with the world championship bronze.
At that crew not only Mincy, gau SSE, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and “Piculín” (Ortiz) participated again, but also the young players (Javier) “Toñito” Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario “Quijote” Morales, which could not be 1990 because of a knee injury thereby.
Crew, which was not perhaps the best one regarding personalities, with which we won however a gold medal and whom large joy prepared us, was that one of the before-olympic tournament 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and young Rolando Hourruitiner as replacement for the closed players because of the occurrences on the Pan-American plays in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against each prognosis.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was certainly Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers on level of the international tournaments are impressing.
Nobody in Puerto Rico dominated in such a way on this level like Piculín.
And this, without considering its career in the different leagues, in which it played.
Who was the best coach from Puerto Rico?
That is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches such as Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From the boys the work of Leo Arill pleases me well.
What believe do you is the best, what you reached in the federation?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which covered the BSN at the beginning of the 90's up to 17 crews in one season.
What remains still doing to you?
There are e.g. things, which I would have introduced, like the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce e.g. only in their area play and only in national play-off on crews from other corners the island meet.
Today the children make unnecessarily many journeys and plays.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table-official and arbitrators.
Whereupon I am proud.
What do you make today?
I hear gladly music, see videos of music my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and from time to time go I to a basketball play.
And naturally I enjoy the society of my Mrs. Isabel, who always was at my side.

Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became world-wide famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as “J.R”. in the TV serial “Dallas”, where it played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role became as the oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the TV serial “Dallas” a symbol of the greed of the 80's, is dead.
It became 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new relay of “Dallas”, Friday died afternoon due to cancer complications in accordance with a press release of the family at The Associated Press by Warner Bros. , Producer of “Dallas”.
“Larry was back in its loved native city Dallas, where he played again the iconic role, which pleased, said him at most” the family.
The family of Larry and its closest friends were with it in Dallas for the celebrations of the Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, which played the role of its wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman, when he died in the hospital of Dallas, said her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
It made all joy, which could do it.
It was creatively, generously, hilariously, funny, affectionately and talented, and I will miss him much.
“He was an original person and lived the life in full courses”, explained Gray in a report.
Hagman 1992 cirrhosis of the liver were diagnosed, and he admitted that he had drunk much over years.
1995 were determined a malicious tumor in its liver, and he underwent of a transplant.
In the years before “Dallas” Hagman on TV charming one as nice type in the years 1965 to 1970 with that sitcom did not become “Jean ever” the TV organization NBC admits.
There it played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is placed on the head, when it meets attractive “Jinn” (easily of Barbara Eden), which will at home live with it.
He was also actor of two comedies, which were radiated only short time, like e.g. The Good Life” (NBC, 1971-72) and “Here incoming goods Go Again” (ABC, 1973).
To its cinema work well evaluated roles belonged to Tonto” and “Primary Colors” in “The Group”, “Harry and from the criticism.
But it was its masterful interpreting of the charming abhorrent J.R., which made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the television chain CBS over the Ewing clan and other figures in their environment were radiated by April 1978 until May 1991.
The advertising slogan “who shot at J.R.? ”, which should create expectation for an episode of full emotions, where the figure was killed by haggard man nearly, led to an international speculation, and millions dollar became in houses bet.
Thus the series reached a spectator record in that time.
When the answer in a chapter in November 1990 admits became, it was seen by on the average 41 million spectators, the “Dallas” into second at most seen entertainment program since the end of “MACHINES” 1983, which had 50 million spectator, transformed.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted from Mary Crosby) had shot.
J.R. it had made pregnant and threatened to represent it as prostitutes if it did not leave the city. In addition, others had reasons to want to see it dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a perfidious businessman and an unfaithful husband, who strove for it to let his alcohol-ill wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) instruct.
“I know, what is to stand Hagman on the gravestone of J.R.”, said 1988.
It should be called “rests here the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing”.
This is the only business, which he did not win.
Victoria Principal, Mitdarstellerin of the original series, remembered on Friday at Hagman as a “enormous personality on and outside of the screen”.
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions adorers in the world and remains us, that had the luck, it knowing and love, in our hearts to receive.
Ten episodes of the new edition of “Dallas” were radiated before few months with large success in the television channel a TNT.
The admission of five chapters for the second relay was final, and a sixth chapter was turned straight, informed the transmitter.
From Warner or from TNT it did not add an immediate explanation, how the loss of haggard man in the series was treated.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works like “South Pacific” and “Peter Pan”.
Martin was still another young person, when it got Larry during her marriage with attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre stages in New York at the beginning of the 50's, afterwards he served from 1952 to 1956 in air forces in England.
There he became acquainted with the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The pair had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived long time in the California city Malibu, where many famousnesses have their domicile.
2001 he called its memoirs “Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) valley about My Life”.
“I did not write anything, from which I believed that it could harm someone or impair it somehow”, said that Associated Press at that time.
After liver transplantation it began for liver donations and worked themselves as a volunteer in a hospital, in order to assist fearful patients.
“I advise it, give them courage, I meet with them, if their operations are approaching and afterwards”, he explained 1996.
I would like to donate something comfort to them, like e.g. “no fear, it is a little uncomfortablly the first time, but you well will be”.
Likewise it began against smoking and participated themselves in several campaigns.

Beginning the course, which studies the “end of the world”
The students apocalyptic topics e.g. examine each week like the nuclear war, zombie, virus and germs and the global heating up.
Each term, if the religion professor decided to hold a course over the end of the world he knew that he had an irresistible fishhook: the end “counting backwards” the Maya calendar is enough on 21 December, from which many humans believed that it means the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea, which should expect him into following both months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some “Deudarmaggedon” it called as well as an increasing conflict under participation of Israel, which place, from which the Christian theoreticians believe that the Apocalypse begins.
“I do not have noticed that this will be the apokalyptischste term, it ever gave” said to Charmé this week the student at the University of Rutgers Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes, what happened today in the world, as if we would be distant thirty days from it, would be this a really good period.
And it reminds of the fact that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And it is not an only professor, this term, which should actually be the latter in history, courses over the “end of the world” offers.
In Temple sitting professor Barry Vacker gives the course to “media, culture and the end of the world.”
The students apocalyptic topics e.g. examine each week like the nuclear war, zombie, virus and germs and the global heating up.
“Analyze we, why these ideas spread, said with the time” it, as well as the way, as hypothetical scenarios are offered, which lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material arrives into the hands of terrorists, for example a war could break out.
The students of films with apocalyptic contents analyzed and examined this month, how they let themselves compare in the comparison with the real life.
“I tried to inform the students about it what possible, probably, convincing and impossible is”, said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor for Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a team, educated a sitting professor for history of art and anthropology in order to offer a course with the simple designation “the end of the world”.
“We do not take up 2012, so that we the option to always keep to be able to hold the course again if the world does not go down, said” Restall.
Despite the “forthcoming fall” the students must study, provide projects and participate in final examinations.
In Penn State the final examination the eve of the Apocalypse is accomplished, why the students do not have other opportunity, than continuing working “up to the night, where the world goes allegedly in the end”, said to Restall.
The courses were much like.
“To two hours there were no more places” said rest universe about its course for students with high average, which filled with 35 students.
