The Republican strategy of resistance to the renewal of Obama's election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat the falsification of the election.
However, in the center believe the last myth, arguing that the cases of fraud in the elections in the United States more rare than deaths from lightning strike.
In addition, the lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is for certain: These new trends will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.
In contrast to the Canadian American states are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009 take laws, the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received a new dimension after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, only one 2011 was adopted 180 bills that restrict the right to vote in the 41 state.
New election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, uprazdnyayut the right to voter registration on the day of the expression and take away the right to vote of citizens who have a prior conviction.
Before the 2006 elections, not one American state not oblige the voters to present photo identification.
Indiana became the first state, which introduced a similar requirement.
The US Supreme Court confirmed in 2008, the constitutionality of the law, passed in Indiana.
Republican authorities rushed to spread the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills, forcing voters to present photo ID, in 34 states.
It is important to note that in contrast to the Quebec American citizens do not have such a universal identity card, a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people, have reached the required voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by the governmental authority of their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 does not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity often exceed a hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people who easily earn less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years of age and 20% of voters from 18 to 29 years do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters, who are believed to vote for candidates from Democrats in several states are not allowed to use photo identification issued by their educational institution.
But these same states permit members may benefit fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans, voting to use certificates issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required evidence of the presence of American citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Starting in 2011, more than ten states have adopted laws requiring voters to prove that they are citizens of the United States.
These measures, apparently aimed to limit voting immigrants from Latin America.
It is estimated that two thirds of the Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011, the laws, uprazdnyayushchie registration of voters on the day of voting in eight states.
They also have limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not been without consequences.
So, for example, during the 2004 election campaign for voter registration has helped make the lists of about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009, led to a fall of 17% level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers took in five other states laws aimed at reducing early voting period.
So, during the general election of 2008 in Florida 33% of voters who voted in advance, were, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened to come from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast to the white, forming 76% of voters, among those who voted in advance amounted to only 46%.
Of course, and their supporters are actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several projects laws was vetirovano gubernatorami-demokratami.
The most ambiguous laws was suspended when the intervention of the attorney general of the United States.
This allowed in part to limit the negative consequences.
So, for example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws requiring charge photo ID.
However, the new rules, joined the action, of course, the implementation of suffrage in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the bias laws adopted, seeing in them an obvious direction to affect the 2012 election results in key states.
Report of the Brennan Center of 2011 demonstrates that states that implemented these laws are 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections of 2012.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative effect on turnout.
In this sense, such actions partly discredit system of American democracy.

Screening prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the test PS is sometimes erroneous results, false negative and sometimes false positive that lead to useless Mu medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant undergoing dispensary, and there is good reason for doubt even more.
Walk test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In the research, conducted in the United States, observed numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so the findings difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time the European found differing levels of mortality for those patients who have been screened, and those who do not it took place.
The study also showed, after a 12 - year observation that the likelihood of metastasis 30-40% higher for those who have not passed the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to pass the test starting in 50 years, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men African-American origin also at increased risk.
The key is the right decision, as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be as aggressive and sluggish current.
The patient needs to clarify the extent of the risk of cancer, offering him options, without compulsory treatment of prostate cancer, which is not a danger to life in the long term, and given the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
Today, many men who have indicated a cancer, will not undergo a course of treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not represent a threat to life.
We will them to offer active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly, we exactly define criteria for making a decision about who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
Thus, I would recommend still pass the test.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine or not to pass this test.
In cooperation with the International Association of Urology, Movember created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the test on the dog.

To prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, the observance of a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is estimated that if all the people are nice and quite moving, 30% of cases could be prevented.
"If no one smoked more, this figure increased to at least up to 50%," said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cases of cancer caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unaccountable.
For the Canadian Association of cancer fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking linked to 85% of cases of lung cancer.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It is doing immense harm to health.
"Even today, in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," said Press Secretary André Beaulieu.
Promising fact: 10 years after giving up smoking risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to Kar, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," adds the Association.
The food
The association also recommends that limit consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities it increases the risks of cancer of the colon.
To avoid the meat products.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or zasola, can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The past can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the association.
The vitamins
In recent years, many scientists engaged in research on the impact of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But for the moment, the results of these studies can not be called clear.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In an assessment of the impact on the development of cancer vitamin D also no full clarity.
However, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes that their anxiety and family medical history is important to discuss with your doctor.
"Hiring the analysis does not lead to cancer."

Higgs boson in the details
Summer a message that scientists may be able to detect the Higgs boson, caused a real boom - - and with good reason.
It is believed that the boson explains the mass of particles in the universe, as much.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the standard model, our best, or at least, "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter, "but which had not been able to find an experienced by.
But physics are not fully confident that we are talking about bozone Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with is indeed a new particle and that it strongly reminiscent of the Higgs boson, predicted the standard model.
In addition, new data presented this week at one major physical Congress in Kyoto, it seems, it confirm the full confidence of some of the data still lacks.
Imagine all the same, that we are talking about bozone Higgs, because the chances of a mistake appear to be minimal, and see what it means.
There are, in this world one law is inevitable, said that two things can not be in the same place at the same time.
To circumvent this rule there is no way, do not try too hard, otherwise hurt yourself.
But although particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it, too, there is one law of a similar nature: the principle of the Pauli exclusion, which suggests that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" is a "state" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
On this basis, physics share particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find decent citizens, called fermionami, who wisely subject to the principle of Pauli.
In the other, the gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - - at least to this principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (by the way, quite extraordinary) particle adventure laboratory Berkeley, these are divided, in turn, into two groups: Meson, of which we are here to say we will not, "particles and forces," by which apply the basic forces of nature and that in some ways applies Higgs boson.
These most, it should be stressed, not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly bozonu: fotonu, or "light," which is a "courier" electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle, which has an electric charge, accelerates or changes direction, it "violates the" electromagnetic field in this particular place, it is like a stone thrown in a pond.
One of the "breach" is born electromagnetic wave (of light or infrared radiation, or UV light, etc., etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photo to date - and, therefore, one of the boson "vectors of force."
More stable field
The same is happening with the Higgs, with the only difference being that, in order to this boson appeared to be "broken" another field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field much, much, much more stable electromagnetic fields; to stir to achieve very, very high energies, as if it was a surface which could only be shaken by very big stone.
That is why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that operated in CERN's Large Hadron Collider, being a circle with a diameter of 27 km! - in order to achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful and also to explain the relationship between the Higgs boson, and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all of the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, he never will keep in the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: Those who interact, have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) do not have.
So, what "can do" all these studies, asks Ms Plamondon?
In the science they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (see), and it also allows physicists find the divergence between the results of observations and forecasts see.
In addition, some of them passionately yearn for, to such divergence was discovered, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for "new physics" and plug some holes model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant flaws, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oj-oj!).
But CERN such differences are not found.
The consequences
The benefits of this research for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not even imagine what kind of revolution will bring their work.
They foresee their application in science, but not more than that.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in the laboratory of Bell, where in 1960 was invented the laser, and who himself has developed the first continuous laser (previous were) in 1962, said that originally the laser was seen rather as a "laboratory gadget."
Imagine ...
And in addition, the application can for tools, accompanying the study.
For example, the same will and Ara Boyle during his optical research in 1969, has developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, though it was not his original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and has earned the Nobel Prize in Physics 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider and necessarily will change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that all can be.

Palliative care is the best way to die ... | "debt"
The Commission for a decent death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of his life.
The debate about to resume, while at the same time preparing the bill.
However, in this crucial area, much work remains to be done.
"Debt" tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
Prostate cancer, razrushavshij inside, gave him a reprieve for two years.
"I was given five years, I lived for seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the orphanage palliative care Viktor-Gadbua in Belúil, where arrived the day before.
"But it is always a shock, it is impossible to prepare," he says.
The disease does its work: unbelievable weakness, which does not give themselves to go to the toilet and even on their own to eat.
Sitting at the table, which is a delicious lunch, he gives up and agrees to him have helped to eat.
He bodritsya, even manages to smile, to talk to strangers, who work around him, bring him drugs, lead it in the bathtub.
Courage before normal death.
"My greatest desire to me cured the diarrhea, it is humiliating," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this malaise.
"For the life we teach that a man has to urinate standing up," said Pierre Broder, a psychologist at the orphanage Viktora-Gadbua.
Regress to the child - for some with an unbearable humiliation.
"It all depends on the ability of man to come to terms with the decline," he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people involved in care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who received palliative shelter Viktor-Gadbua, all sick with cancer.
Forecasts looking into them to a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more help, called "therapeutic."
Ms. A., 89 years, most afraid to die "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has enabled me to know their children.
"I have good children," she added.
"I want nothing more in life," she says, before being allowed to put her mask, remove emitted breath.
She is still waiting in the coming days last visit his son, from Italy.
In the orphanage Victor Gad Bois with a group of volunteers to provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is the palliative care, which remains, when nothing more can not be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec for every 11 700 residents have one place in the institutions of palliative care.
This very little, given that sooner or later we are all dead.
Here, life goes on in the best conditions, which are possible, "explains Dr. Christiane Martel is one of the doctors shelter.
Whether it comfort physical, emotional or spiritual.
We agree to provide wash of brandy or Pepsi, though he will ask.
We no longer control blood sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we had brought beer Mr relates, who died today at night.
On the morning of his son to drink a beer in the feet of late.
"We help close, as well as patients," said Nathalie Savard, director of the care of the sick.
In the orphanage Viktor-Gadbua no day is similar to the previous one.
Next to the 93-letnim old man who enjoys his last meeting with the family in the yard, sitting on their pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies young man 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two small children and pereprobovashij all, in order to survive.
"In the past six months from three to five beds, always busy cancerous patients under the age of 45 years," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients taken to an orphanage Viktor-Gadbua, coming from the house, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to care, that is available to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in the orphanage.
And some agencies, such as shelter Viktor-Gadbua and society of palliative care at home of the big Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively on caring for cancer patients.
It is this big gap in the health care system Quebec makes many doctors - specialists in palliative care to fear the law, computerizing and assistance in suicide.
Since October circulates a manifesto, signed by beacons in the field of palliative care, doctor Balfurom Mauntom and doctor Lyapuantom and endorsing the their disagreement with a similar initiative.
According to Dr Cristian Martel, Quebec health system not effective enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before they will be allowed to transition to euthanasia.
Recently, "she says," I saw the patient, who has spent 14 days in the emergency department, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I am afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day trying to save patients, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard already been minimal, when she stopped chemotherapy.
When I reported my oncologist that I stop treatment, she said to me that regrets that I stop the fight, "she said.
At the same time, she I said that my days are numbered!
Care no
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who asked about the death, thank medical personnel, for the fact that they have not fulfilled their request, after the team on palliative care facilitates their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsa, Yukon and Monroe, director of palliative care in the community of palliative care in the home of the big Montreal, patients are not susceptible to pain inflexible in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient is sleeping to the moment of his death, from time to time or permanently.
Can not be more pretend that we do not know about these suffering.
More and more often, patients who fail to ease the pain, will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want to held," which means "I want to me easier."
The establishment of this report was made possible thanks to the journalist Grant from the Institute of Health Research Canada.

And large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, collectors of political parties and experts on the Italian Mafia day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system," the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and the Mafia.
"Industry," which is very expensive cost taxpayers of Quebec, especially in the 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how split the system after they were put on it all means, jokes Jacques Dyusheno, MP and former chief of police of Montreal."
It is thanks to him in 2011 scandal erupted as a by-product of the investigation of official crimes related to dorozhno-stroitelnymi contracts in Quebec, which the prime minister of the time of the Liberals, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly.
"The report Dyusheno" established a direct link between the industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stresses, only one ministry of transport would have kept the billion dollars in contracts" if some withheld their instincts to take share.
The Commission Charbonneau "already two mayors," he added, hoping that it can "to uncover the scheme behind the individuals."
Permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The case created in 2011, a permanent anti-corruption unit, which entered a vast state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, employees of the special unit "hammer," which made after the 2009 "stochnyj Cartel Montreal," Stop the value of the contracts.
Over the past weeks has conducted a series of searches, and some municipal officials, in particular Franco and Risharu Markottu - The mayor of a small town, had been charged with fraud and corruption.
Line - Gilles Vaillancourt, the recently retired from the post of mayor de Laval, the third largest city of the province of Quebec.
The suspect in neodnokratnom receiving bribes when placing public orders.
In addition, the indictment was charged in several engineers of railways Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
The last blew up a real bomb, having told the investigation of "the system" of government contracts.
For several years Zambian gave 3% of the value of the contracts signed in Montreal, transferred the facilitator, connected with the mafia, which, in turn, to translate the money party Mayor Gérald Tremblay "joint Montreal."
In the 2000s Zambito soril money right and left. He listed more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 Euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals, were ongoing then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally collected funds for former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Nathalie Normando.
Sewer contracts, in which the cost
In Montreal "system" corruption worked trouble-free.
Gilles Syurprenan, a former engineer, civil construction, described in detail her before the Commission: in the ten years he has received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to the golf tournaments, restaurants, the games of hockey and bribes in a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the value of it.
Other officials responsible for the construction of roads, admitted that received on the leg, zavyshaya account for 30-40% with the help of fake additions.
Then one organizer of the party mayor, Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay is that he deliberately turned a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget, napolnyavshego party offices dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, bathed Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal was one of the first deputies in Montreal, zabivshikh alarm.
The mayor of the district of River-de-Preri in the east of the island, it is opposed to the 2010 sale of municipal land, purchased for $5 million and pereprodannogo for ... 1.6 million developers at the height of the construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which eventually will be launched, it "he pulls the plug, allows to understand the functioning of the system, ants and to stop the gangrenu and identify the perpetrators."
This process it kharakterezuet as "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wounds, but Montreal will be necessary to have their own investigation team and the observer, in order to avoid the return of questionable practices.
As we ubiraemsya home.
On a regular basis.
Jacques Dyusheno notices for his part, that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially concerned about the role of elected officials who knew about the scheme, but is not involved in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebec proposes to limit to $100 donations to parties, but, according to him, it will not change the situation: "While we do not strictly limit elected costs policy will be dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of granting government contracts and financing parties: "We can not go below; bravely in the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and legality."
If this story and cast a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Dyusheno calls on those who laughs, look in your own yard ...

"Paris St Germain, FC Barcelona!"
This season you have achieved extraordinary scope.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual unawareness, but it can - - and new measurement of Paris St Germain.
Profit great players.
I next to them every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I do not LA.
From the start in the center of the preliminary preparation in the Klerfontene and prior to my arrival in saint-étienne I always Chagall forward.
So, you are learning the benefits of competition, established by Carlo Ancelotti...
Topping this summer is not a novelty play matches a very high level.
They also know that every training is very important.
This leads to a player like me, eager to be at the level and place to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has support in my positioning.
He help deputy like Claude Makélélé, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the owner?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspire respect the technical staff.
Today in the first league there is no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with top clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles Paris.
In January, I was with him off the conversation.
Then I wandered away from a series of injuries.
The trust, which he has me, also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the season?
In the first League Lyon took place at the US leader.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we spectacularly qualify in one eighth of the final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, all can be.
We will be able to say their word face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in order to be able to take the return match in one eighth final.
Whether a first class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget ...
In order to become a major European club, Paris is necessary to win the titles and consolidate positions in the long term.
Today it is not the case.
Financially Paris St Germain have the means to make this project real.
Do not take the title in the first league, as last season, will be a huge failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we warmly wish to get the champion's title.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, it was a disappointment, because we had to come to the finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assumes the title of champion.
But the other team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's going to be fine.
Despite the fact that the fight for the title have entered such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think that we have the strength to win.
Do you think that the media expected too much from Paris St Germain?
It's normal that we expect much, given how much was invested and what we have players.
We are fully ready to do.
On the other hand, when we are at home against Troyes and we find that, of course, it's a bit frustrating.
We wonder what in the first place people expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4 - 0.
We do not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a project of the game.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League, that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has two seasons fails to pass one eighth final, although they too have spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amount, you were 15 points ahead of the winter break.
It would be a dereliction of our opponents and to the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, were "awakened" the new Paris St Germain.
This shows just how fascinating first league.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to yourself that, despite all the difficulties, we won.
Paris St Germain, it seems, depends entirely on the feats of Ibrahimovi.
So what if they say that there is a "Zlatanozavisimost."
It only means that very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to do this, and he proves that he is the first star of the league.
Wherever he played, he has shown that he is a great player and a star on a global scale.
As a group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people that surround it.
What he did, it's really only.
It stimulates and others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates all move forward.
You survived the Euro - 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I warmly desire to participate in the Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me a bit of game time.
I saw many things there, and I came out stronger from there.
Today I managed to play good qualifier matches.
This is what I hoped for since my baptism of the blue.
We have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now must behave.
What do you think about the first months Didier Deshama at the head of the blue?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the selection group for the world championships.
He is a strict coach, he is close with the players and inspires the victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to compare.

Pay and sell without the help of banks
The exact opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on the central bank, numbered transactions between the receiving parties C commission fees on their processing.
In addition, as often happens with these technologies, clear political vision: the conviction that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, invented (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (convertible into dollars, Euros ...) and secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows for the exchange of files between members of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites take bitkojny for the implementation of the donations or as a means of payment.
The course bit coy on, reaching a maximum of 30 dollars (23 Euros) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2, before return about to ten dollars (courses are given on the website of the bit coin charts. Com).
Nothing special compared with the global exchange real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on the virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes the bitkojn as "the most successful virtual currency," "a rival the dollar or the Euro" and "similar to the common currency."
Bitkoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as "loans" used to promote the video game, which is made in the course of the game, or that it is possible to buy (and sometimes exchanged).
Social network Facebook also has developed a similar system.
But the operation always exchange controls and processes of any central authority.
The Bitkojn all nodes of the network are at the same time, holders of accounting books, auditors, issuers exchange, pokupatelymi and sellers.
Functions the network?
Each transaction between two users actually going on between the two electronic addresses, like e-mail.
Only payment for each new user can choose another address, thus providing anonymity.
A set of information relating to the deal, signed by e-mail, using a system with double encryption key.
The network also can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to check that bit coy also used in the transaction, really exist in the public accounts book, sent Noah across the network.
A key step is the registration of new transactions in this book.
It passes through the mathematical tasks, sent by computers, determined that, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege to add this new line.
It is a phase of hashing file, that is a large file conversion a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers take "a new transaction and add it to the room, before" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
As soon as this number is found, other sites it is easy to check that it is the right thing.
Transaction thus turns nerarzryvno associated with a chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the digital signature.
If the purpose of cheating user very quickly (in less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice among and subject to money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed network - and the other would have remained unconfirmed, because they have different electronic signature.
Computer, determined to task, gets 50 bitkojnov.
To avoid inflation, the award regularly is divided in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitkojnov in circulation therefore limited to 21 million, but they are up to one stomillionnoj, that leaves a reserve of ...
The complexity of the tasks also increases with the increase in computing power.
Life Network already experienced the ups and downs.
Sites providing services, were subjected to attack, and bitkojny were stolen from the reserves.
"Used by the defect does not apply to the protocol," said Pierre well, who recently launched the pay company payments real money using the network bit coin.
The ECB said of the possibility of money laundering through this this anonymous service.
But cash also have this disadvantage.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog software WordPress, their permit.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book and found that almost 80% of the bitkojnov are in circulation.
"Giant sell-off" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," pleased Jon, working in Coinabul, which deals with conversion bitkojnov in gold.
Pierre Nuaza, another author of the benefits of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or non-contact payment via mobile phone, but she uses to verify the transactions is cheaper.
The holder of the better control of their personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Enough to tell the address, which you can take pictures and recognize the "phone, specifies Pierre Nuaza, not to worry, because he has already thousands of users.
There is a general trend revision of the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"Before bit coin to establish ourselves, will be some time, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB in its report suggests, by the way, to review a variety of risks, considered today elevated, in the success of this system.

We have gone from Afghanistan.
What next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan, Kapisa Province and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its own territory, and for Afghans to choose their future, hoping not only to the US.
The US suffered mostly Afghan peasants, which we regarded as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and crippled by.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from farmers, who reject the presence of foreign armies, as was the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They suffer, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West will behave more delicately.
The departure of French troops from the base Nidzhrab, which I watched from the height of the hills of almond trees the French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being.
Since the end of 2014 invasion of the Taliban at Kabul will not be.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of the struggle between different factions.
Taking them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid for these farmers, in which their surpassed Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved and in these days.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in the position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, exciting public land to resell them under development immigrants, returning from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American contracts.
They discredited; most of them, by the way, do not even fought.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that would have consisted not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those who managed to American generosity: outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during exile in Iran or Pakistan, they estimated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years; in Kabul now there are 5 million people, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with, both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to go back to mrakobesiyu old parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which are the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment, the army is.
Authorities, will be her command, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders, anti-Soviet struggle, already taking measures to restore the provincial guards, who would not obey the central authorities.
Afghanistan, mountain country, with strong local differences, must be to a certain extent detsentralizovan, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the election, targeted for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put back on its feet, no dam functions, no system is not repaired.
All imported; produced nothing, fruit and vegetables.
Priority given to private initiative.
In a country that had been destroyed by the thirty years war, state control over infrastructure would be needed.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has vast mineral riches.
It only intensified the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to capture them.
Without the energy for processing iron ore and copper on the spot, without the means of transport to their exported through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese already almost left the field copper months, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers in the province.
It is also necessary to one day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which to a large extent depend on imports and exports, restored normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional aid: Lyceum for Girls, boys, the faculty of the French language at the University of the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support archaeological delegation.
In 2009, in an effort to "win the hearts and minds" and to perform the task of combining aid with offensive operations, service civil-military activities "at the Ministry of Defence (CIMIC), in 2012, along with a small French public organization, contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intense involvement of the local work force, could help to contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in the area of arable land.
We leave the memory of himself, having spent two billion Euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget has promoted to improve the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests made on the implementation of the small agricultural work emanating from the local communities in the province of Kapisa province.
To get rid of uprisings, governed by foreign groups, which want to farmers, as I said, we need to provide them a small military support, which would be well controlled themselves and would come to him directly.

Heavy birth of the constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky step of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the question of the constitutional declaration, which temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play all out.
Finding all by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the constituent assembly will vote on the final text of the following day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state has provided the Assembly two additional months to finish the job.
Soon for two years, as Egypt is based on a preliminary text, in which several amendments that weakens the institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative is only reinforced the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the president persists in its "autocratic delirium," continuing "to violate the word" and "flout the law."
In the camp of his followers are confident that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, speeding up the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which makes the brothers to give up the intention to explain to Egyptians text, article after article.
For the president is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, it seems, convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with American Weekly time.
The more that the call for accelerated voting like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people, "or you vote for my text, or I leave emergency powers," which is supposed to be completed after the adoption of the constitution.
In this strange atmosphere 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, for the most part, the Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals not responded to the challenge.
In the middle of November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to deliver an opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same thing.
That the necessary quorum was reached, 11 people, spare, participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to our Muslim brother.
It is not surprising that in most cases, the articles were progolosovany unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day came around ... time to pray, because some members of the Committee thought that the hours of the constituent assembly were incorrectly configured.
The text, which yesterday even as the vote went, consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, Article 2 at the end of the day remained identical article of the constitution of 1971, that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
Salafi party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" to "rules" that would allow them more strict application.
For the Islamists the fact that this article has not been changed, is a testament to their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," meet the liberals, who see in this a PR.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the constitution is going through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which gives the university Al-Azhar advisory role, in particular, with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of the laws of Sharia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommiers, it is alarming, because "people to make decisions, not elected and do not have no democratic legitimacy."
We see the emergence of theocracy. "
Many liberals, of the fact that the next rector of the university, it seems, will be much less moderate than the current.
"At the moment, there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text, "it is not, and people with university education, some trained in the French system" - calming Alexis, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that "around Article 220 ambiguity may arise, because the terms used in it borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, "note ed.].
And in the future may question how civil judge competent to pass judgment about it. "
In addition to their religious aspects, the text adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives broad powers to the president of the republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claim that they significantly reduced compared to what were under the old regime.
Another contentious point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will take place not in parliament, and the National Defense Council.
Also be banned the trial of civilians in military courts, despite requests associations for the protection of human rights.
The latter also expressed concerns about the text, which they consider subversive of freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and from now on is forbidden to insult, that could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles no longer speaks to the protection of women, highlights the Kheba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word that does not appear in the previous constitution.
At a time when the Egyptian president was to speak last night on television, manifestation are scheduled today in the second half of the day.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"The Great and Mighty" to Moscow over: migrants money language
The deputies and human rights activists argue that would give the law on mandatory language testing, in the country already appeared fraudsters selling "certificates"
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million guest workers.
For the most part, the citizens of Central Asia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families left at home.
The law came into effect on December 1, according to which every labor migrant is obliged to take the test on knowledge of the Russian language.
As long as this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the services, housing and utilities, life and retail trade.
However, over time, "promise in the federal migration service, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
The surrender will have not only the language, but also Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to verify and to obtain, and to extend work permits.
The exception is valid only for the citizens of those countries where Russian is the official language.
Not subject to the law and people have to get certificates and diplomas on education to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The benefits, being doomed and protection of the rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Institute of the Russian language, Pushkin, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, Saint Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Pass the tests migrants will in all cities; in Russia have opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative to introduce testing supported and deputies of the State Duma, and the Federal Migration Service.
But human rights defenders, before the law took effect, many times had time to ask a press question: what is, in fact, will?
That will change the language, and for the Russians, and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, say representatives of migration services, "this will reduce the number of people suffering from" labor of slavery. "
Many say now on the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains the head of the representation of the Federal Migration Service of the Russian Federation in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should start before their departure.
Only organized system will set at 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems appear the migrants without profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, "said Sebelev the future migrant doomed to face a dishonest people who under the guise of aid vsunut him" putyovku "close Barack, where he and dozens of his kind will be months languish without food and documents, 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get many complaints from our migrants.
"At home they promise one thing and on arrival they deceive, select passport, not pay promised salaries," confirms the chief management labor migration MC Tajikistan Sharipov.
Not rugajsya, nasyalnika!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, gathered to work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country, which seek, but also on sobstvennykh-to write with difficulty.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as the trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive even primary education.
Because their families can not even feed the children, let alone to their dress decently, and with the school.
Dorastaya to adolescence, these guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if not with knowledge of the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and shallow."
However, in respect of the language of the law, human rights activists note one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there are no status - there will be no examination, no subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized entry prohibited"
Many of the visitors claim to get official status in our country is not as simple as that.
The reason is bureaucratic and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.
Staff of the Russian police know that we have mostly false documents, there is no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two on cigarettes, tea," shared with journalists citizen of Tajikistan Umed Khushkadamov.
"Not, buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it turned out that there are not only false documents for registration.
Few "sham" certificates of completion of a language tests already seized by the federal migration service.
Fake paper printed on ordinary color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, thus facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than two times more expensive procedures official testing: It will cost Labour the three thousand.
The fact that the main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption, to "ID" could not be simply buy, converge and representatives of the authorities, and human rights activists.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise am, not who managed to successfully pass testing the first time, the study of basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not have knowledge of Russian, will be offered work in areas which do not involve active communication with people.

The Interior Ministry does not take in turnover of illegal arms market
The share of crimes using legal weapons of extremely small
Interior Ministry proposes to tighten the law with respect to the owners of civil weapons.
The authorities' response to recent incidents: press shots at weddings, when without its victims, and the massacre, ordained by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov by which Press seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the wearing of travmatiki in public places and to raise the age from which you can get a license for weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and counter corruption Irina and promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will contribute to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is pleased with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws."
The network appeared open letter, whose authors - representatives of various public organizations need to give up the "senseless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons minimal, said the BBC Russian Service yurist-kriminalist Vasily forest rangers.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012 committed 142 crimes using firearms, registered in the bodies of internal affairs, in the same period, there were 11 68 thousands of crimes.
The authors of an open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civil weapons not places to go on the black market.
Now, they said, in Moscow you can find any weapons at a low price.
Meanwhile, the interior ministry argue that control the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
"Black market weapons through several channels.
The main channels of the five, says retired Colonel Victor, ten years who had worked in the structure of the Ministry of Education and military headquarters.
A screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first is the "army or military footprint," that is a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"Weapons dragged and Russian officers, and the Caucasians," says.
The next type of "black" - weapons stolen criminals representatives of the security forces.
Huperzia explains that this includes and gone from police warehouses, and stolen directly to law enforcement officers.
Illegal "baggage" go on sale from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often have occurred explosions.
"There is a proven version of that part of the arson were made specifically to cover the shortage," said former military.
Their contribution, according to Baran ca, making weapons manufacturers.
"Now get divorced private arms factory, which does not stand up to competition in the international market and thrown weapons out of the floors on the black market, including Moscow," said the expert.
Another source of "black market" smuggling.
A lot comes pistols and assault rifles from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes primitive, and has formed the Mafia, which organized the flow," explains the former military.
Where the weapons?
Experts thought, what is the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons on the black market.
The report in 2011 prepared center the troubled analysis and gosudarstvenno-upravlencheskogo design.
Experts analyzed the reporting of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, kriminologicheskuyu literature and open data portals on issues.
The overwhelming majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "through the fault of the officials, whose work is related to the weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases, the weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur theft at the stage of the production of weapons, 5 percent of the "black archaeology."
One of the weapons stores who requested anonymity to call his name, assures that the weapons, found black kopatelyami, long no one buys - too old.
More often than not, as he says, the new party sellers go to a military warehouse.
A person buys unit, such as TT pistol.
He prescribed it, pass through the fence.
"He carries her to the city and sells here for 900 Euros a piece with two shops," he says
"The police in the course of all cases, so periodically when burning plan for crimes, is conducting a supervisory procurement from traders illegal weapons," adds consultant.
"As in the luxurious shop"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through friends.
I had looked at the sites, in blogs, has not yet responded comrade, who offered to come to the platform "racing," where will the man who me in the corner, where we will bargain.
The price of the barrel I learned only there
Military observer Viktor Huperzia
To get the barrel I need a friend, who has a way out, "says." I have a friend there, but I do not believe in it.
Sellers in the markets there, but there is also need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that she is a daughter of tooth fell."
I am now even a couple of caste in a person, in which I am sure.
He also delivers only to me, because I did not know that.
Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Huperzia tried himself in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid - 1990s, when it was preparing to publish an article about it.
The scheme, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos, where "anything."
"I feel like in luxurious shop," recalls military.
The buyer, according to, does not offer a pig in a poke - you can try.
I, a potential customer, not just buy - We drive with the seller in the forest, there set a target.
"I was given the opportunity to shoot, and I am assured that weapons beats well, begin to bargain," describes the procedure expert.
Shop on the couch
Search engine and online posting on Web sites and groups "in contact," where the offer to buy weapons "for different purposes."
It does not need any documents and personal meetings.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," write the advertising cap on the site "to buy combat pistol or machine."
It users leave their application and asking questions.
And will sell?
"Without a license, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow" - tersely formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service now razbrosila a huge network of fake sites and willing to buy combat weapons rowing by a shovel.
People go, like a hungry fish on the food, and then drill in Siberia coal
Military observer and former military Victor Huperzia
I heard about such schemes: usually site registered outside the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer through an ATM produces payment.
"In response, send the photo and instruction, where hidden weapons," said a spokesman for the public organization "right to bear arms," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor argues that leaving the application on the site, you can stay without weapons and get behind bars.
The Federal Security Service now razbrosila a huge network of fake sites and willing to buy combat weapons rowing by a shovel.
"People go, like a hungry fish on the food, and then drill in Siberia coal," he says.
Makarov for $100
Buying illegal small arms, according to experts, it is possible to meet the $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislova of the organization "right to bear arms," Makarov pistol can be bought for $100-300.
Wait will have a month and a half.
He shipped from a long-term storage leadership of these warehouses middle management.
According to the official stastistike departments, compared to January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole of Russia has decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousands, and the number of detected cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 percent.

In the United States strike workers and supermarkets
Through the work at the box office, "MacDonald" goes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days of America wave of protests against low wages in the Corporation's department stores Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, "" Uendis "and" Kentucky ."
So far, no one is taken to predict whether this wave will turn in the ninth wave or it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
Shares support trade unions and a number of left-wing organizations.
In addition to raising modest salaries, who receive ordinary employees of Walmart and fast food system, the aim of the co-sponsors of the protests is the establishment of trade union organizations.
While this sector of the economy hardly stirred with the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Shares began last week, after a day of Thanksgiving, in the so-called "Black Friday," when America fallen orgy of cheap sales, with millions of average citizens, and sometimes accompanied by.
On this day, some employees of the Corporation Walmart, in which all over the world work 2.2 million people, have left their jobs and picket secretive together with the trade unions and left-wing activists shops Corporation, whose goods provided for people of modest and middle-class.
Walmart sells all in the world, from the cradle, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores by an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Many underpaid workers Walmart only in their work.
Availability and range of goods made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods cheap in part because little is paying their workers.
The past also complained about the heavy working conditions, for example, the lack of trucks or hand scanners.
Participants of the shares in the "Black Friday" demanded higher salaries and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the Corporation, jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical worker Walmart, 9.5 dollars per hour, this expenditure not afford, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley, argue that if Walmart will increase salary to 12 dollars per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
It is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If Walmart entirely wage growth on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will do them all 46 cents more expensive.
For the year they will spend some 12 39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart fairly point out that the protests have occurred only in the nine states and not caused corporations or malejshchego damage.
"Black Friday" continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day, and during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
A total of the cash registers produced in "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Corporation spokesman Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post, that Jobs left a total of "less than five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was just "another gimmick" a trade union.
"Free cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (in this city does not favour, and so they are not), "MacDonald si" and other cheap restaurants.
Macdonald says that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even give you the hospital and does not pay you for honest work!
Dzhumejn Williams, a member of the New York City
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7, $25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants over time increase, but not much, and on average their ordinary workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars per hour.
Less than them in this expensive city no one earns.
How can you be in New York for the money, incomprehensible to me.
Once through "MacDonald si" took place almost a quarter of American teenagers and their after school, living with parents.
Few people saw it as a main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly coming across' Web interview with workers "MacDonald," who complain that must live on this salary and sometimes even feed her children.
On the other hand, the Forum newspaper, the Wall Street Journal hanging commentary, whose author notes that irresponsible to have a child, if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday, "MacDonald's" on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast food system began to pay at least $15 per hour, more than doubled their current minimum earnings.
They also demanded that the fast food in the area of trade union organizations have been created.
American law prohibits the administration to prevent and punish activists of the trade union movement and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes it easier for them to life.
But cover Union fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the main staff turnover.
Not consonant
Noisy protests were held on that day, and a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the action was in the middle of the day rally of McDonald's near Times Square, which made by several local Democrats, in particular, member of the Dzhumejn Williams, insisted: "McDonald's says that he sells billions of cabins, and after that he did not even give you the hospital and does not pay you for honest work!."
Demonstrators supported and other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for the post of mayor of the City, Bill de Blasio, insisted that "we need to vigorously join in support of the fast food workers so that they have achieved a fair pay and economic prosperity, which deserves every nyu-jorkets!."
As described what happened to the New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of American fast food industry.
But it involved only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of rapid catering, in which New York tens of thousands of people.
It is not clear whether this will bring spark of flame mass movement.

"Fool the brain is medium"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme, rich augmented reality recently taken seen largely through the prism of special glasses.
First summer at its annual conference of the current model showed Google, and then in November, it was known that an application for a patent filed and Microsoft.
A conversation with the head of the group of Interactive in Kembridzhskoj laboratory Microsoft Sharamom Izadi follows that for scientists of the company points - passed stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating a virtual open spaces.
Tell me, please, in general, what does your research group?
"We are engaged in human interactions with machines, but at the same time, are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
As humanity mass at the stage of the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes the finger.
We want to look at five to 10 years ahead and foresee the drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, the prefix Xbox and Kinect sensors is a step forward, and almost none of the Xbox today without Kinect is not for sale, after all interesting zhestovoe management.
What are we waiting ahead?
- despite the fact that the Kinect suffered interaction to a physical level, much still going on the flat screen, sometimes in 3 D.
Enter information improved (system gets more data), and the conclusion is not very.
We are trying to change this, working on true three-dimensional display systems on the basis of various technologies, including proektivnykh.
Need to release the computer world in our physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement real world virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about the voice control?
The popular thing, but do not overestimate it?
"It certainly is not a panacea - privacy question, because they do not always want to notify others of their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own market niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project, in which we thought over gestures, but not over, and over such being parsimonious, short.
At the same time, the gestures filmed not camera device, and naruchnym, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While big, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of wrist watches.
But in general, the future of the mixed type of management, for example, a gesture + voice.
Like?
- for example, how do you ask me to give you the bank?
You say and at the same time show.
"I usually just say.
"Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- that is, you want to force users to adapt to what can or can not at the moment the machine?
"It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we mostly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will more precisely define the human reaction.
It can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
"If you're talking about your work with sensors Xbox kin, what you claim to modern cameras?
Lacks permission, depth or something?
"In principle, the current generation is what can make a start in our work on the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a rate of 1,000 a / s.
But it is not in themselves, as the Matrix and depth.
The last point of view of the current technology is not good enough for us - it adds to the work of designers algorithms.
That is, to keep in mind not only about resolution on axes X and Y, and Z.
It is also very important speed, the number of frames per second.
Traffic rights quite dynamic, and the current 30 to / with frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Beriev be quieter with our P laboratory made the sensor touch with adjustable delay processing - - from 1 to 100 m with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60 - 100) index.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would in my work is the equivalent of such a device, not requiring kasanij to frames per second was more.
- and the number of cameras increase does not need?
- There are three "chambers," one of which in fact - infrared emitter, and the second receiver reflected signal.
And this is the third camera is, in fact, the typical sensor of the visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem ...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount of settlements.
It would be a good idea to create a flexible counterpart kin, play with the camber location of the cameras and to see how this will help in 3 D determining provisions.
"As far as I remember, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, not presented to the public their points.
You do not think that in terms of everyday use of technology, rich augmented reality glasses is one of the most promising platforms?
"Of course, all the time, holding a smartphone in raised hands, not very convenient, but that's what I think: The most steep option would be" "reality, when on the basis of cloud platforms you could switch to points on the smartphone, projection screen and then everywhere.
Points is a very personal device, at the same time, their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time, the weakness of the reality on the basis of points will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
"Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in" Iron Man ," but also an ordinary mortal.
There is one problem, which often indicate critics of this idea: there is no tactile recall!
Hands do not feel anything!
What answers your group is preparing for the challenge?
In his lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh account breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be an additive of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - Use of second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
It perfectly registers clicking!
But there are technologies that are aimed at giving this "the images in the Air" - for example, several aimed ultrasonic beams at a certain point, where the finger, gives a sense, but as long as it is very weak - as if you on the pads.
There are also bracelets at the wrists, which affect the nerve endings in the fingers is a promising direction.
"You tried to deceive the brain?
Make him think that he feels that seemingly must feel at the moment when he sees something?
"That's a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
Here lies another task over which will have to beat for a long time - - how to make a person physically located in a very limited space, to believe that he is an open, virtually endless - work and the concepts of cross-country tracks (not, like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
The fool the brain is a medium, the work is still very for many years.
This is what makes working on virtual reality such attractive to researcher - many things in absolutely its infancy.

Instead of culture - Rosbalt. Ru
"Rosbalt" continues to project "Petersburg Vanguard" dedicated to city dwellers, who are ahead of us, in the forefront of culture and art.
The top-spisok already got bright figures of St. Petersburg, whose achievements are outside the scope of the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing the fame.
The new hero "Rosbalt" outrageous by the artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller is a bearded man dressed in all red, which meets the Russian Museum, summer garden, on the fashionable and vernisazhakh.
Picture Cyril Miller always gather crowds of spectators, where they not exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg sotsialno-filosofskikh, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, its appearance on the streets calling smile residents of the city, the mood.
He recently took hands and became St. Petersburg sharmanshchikom, as ripe for this complex role of all of its existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, and why are you still go around the city in the red rather than yellow or turquoise, for example?
"I chose red as a designer, dealing with a view and image.
In this world red color is a compromise between the artist and society.
Although society, that a bit grey, causes aggression and excitement not good properties.
But my provocations aimed at conversation began.
The whole history of my provocative shares - an invitation to the debate.
"And when you realized that to be an artist?
At the exhibition in DC Nevsky, where were exhibited my work.
I realized that this is my way.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists has passed, and the new, free like me were unintelligible.
I became friends with New Wave artists, post lawn in, which led to the Pushkin "10," and more waves.
I casts theater, clothes, music, all genres, the words.
- and all this has been united in your art clinic ... "It was important to me to go to the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the need to gather the best creative forces.
In 1995 I took territory on Pushkin - 10, and there, there was no repair, there was a musical and artistic club, Bohemian Club, home of the St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: prefectures, Tekila-dzhaz, remember the cord led the project "ear Van Gogh."
Cord and his friends sang under the veneer light songs, they were in obtyagivayushchem tights, among them was a fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it was "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg was leading many programs to khali-galivskikh times.
We gave them, and went to his great career, and basic education and the education he received there.
Gallery D 137, "club" the echoes from Art-kliniki.
Our employees there and gone.
I hero yesterday's century, when the culture will mean something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "people of our city."
In the category of "artist of the year" was named I ended my culmination.
In the new times of the old rules uncomfortable work, I am a man of truth, integrity and culture of the last century.
In our years, it is easy to be popular, but culture and the popularity of split, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
"Your work is characterized by manner.
"A lot of my paintings are hits, they are clearly expressed the urgency and sharpness.
I will have the software exhibition, "the Russian Museum in."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used to social was now be so is a painful and scary.
But in all, the tragedy of the shooting.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian dressing in order.
Now on clothes are met, based on foreign mechanics, not the inner man.
And, perhaps, his hand file can not be and should be.
And deception will be lifted with the help of dressing.
"We recently saw you in the role of the city. - cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, like me, they will be.
"Well can and commercial art can be beautiful?
Now commercial art has to be orderly, considerate, sweet.
Is disintegration of cultures.
Earlier, the people pressed in the pack, La Bohème one loved, another.
Now all crashed mikrosoobshchestva, is hard to please everyone.
I am not one hundred dollar paper to all like.
Now need to think who will be like.
Now each of the cult hero 100 fans.
The Stas and Mikhailova comes a few thousand!
- come to broshenki there sekso-sotsialnaya sphere works.
The cultural soil 300 people will come, and 10,000 not come, and as a result, less management, money, everything.
I have fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, do not spoil acquired.
I wrote in his youth such paintings that one collector they are on the wall next to the Falk and Larionov by Hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually finish.
Now often confusing.
Say: the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is of another opera.
I am a man of culture yesterday, grew the examples of artists who lived in poverty, and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing pictures.
I for this is culture.
- Kirill, which lacks Petersburg?
"Good cultural experts.
There is such a notion: official from the culture.
But not all of them can do culture.
The right tsars was, the Kings, can not really understand the culture, but they understood the need to keep the right experts.
This is in Moscow now good consultants.
In St. Petersburg people have to be experts, but they are, need higher experts who correctly appreciate these experts and will give them an opening.
Now thrives vkusovshchinka.
The same, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we take, there are some artists who should look for other museums.
- what is for you - St. Petersburg?
Petersburg is the cultural capital of culture in Moscow, much more, there is soil.
And our stones art grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, this is wrong.
Here in Europe a lot of people are curious. Who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer.
We need to make fashionable art, as it did at the beginning of the last century.

Give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with asteroidom-ubijtsej.
Caravan of the ships to land us on board go in search of a spare planet.
In order to save humanity, the question arises as to continue the sort in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare the planet?
I think that the choice is small.
In fact, these planets only two, which you can explore at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said a senior researcher at the National Astronomical Institute named after P. Sternberg (sh) Vladimir sur Dean.
But if Mars conditions more suitable for life, on the surface of Venus - temperature to 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus ... in space.
Approach to issues of reproduction in space began with flora.
A half-century ago conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations grown in orbit peas are no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then in orbit insects, tiny fruit mukh-drozofil.
In 1979, space sent eggs quail, to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get on exit absolutely normal young bird.
But further problem begins.
"The problem related to the fact that this nestling must find support, he must get back on its feet and start moving," explains the head of the Laboratory of the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev.
Not finding support, the Chicks indiscriminately.
And after 10 hours in newborn took place full atrophy instincts.
The chicks do not react to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And the two times we vyluplyali chicks, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them," notes the failure of the experiment with the space Vladimir Sychev.
Animals last time biological "minikovcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 experiments will continue.
The biosputnike "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
The experiment with rats, which were sent into space with the fruit.
In principle, there found nothing supernatural.
"It was just the bio satellites, but again, this is an isolated experiment, and such research should be conducted," said Vladimir Si.
After the landing of the space rats appeared offspring.
But the approach to the problem of reproduction directly in space until it happens.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing, usual environment, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
The man, in contrast to the beast NIS, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and able to create an emotional background.
For ethical reasons such experiments are not carried out.
But women in space travel for 50 years.
The biggest risk was.
And the most precious, that humanity, is a woman's body.
Our Chaika flown, and no one on Earth could not say whether he will continue after the flight into space.
If she can give birth to a child after the flight.
"After all, no one responded to this question," said veteran rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolayev was a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second Svetlana Savitskoj, twice in orbit and in outer space, was born the son.
However, the risk remains.
We have very little units there are astronauts, who after long flights all cost, and growing healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even under orbital flight," summarizes a cosmonaut and hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia's Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity should look for some new ways of biotechnology, protection from radiation, creating an artificial gravity.
The obligatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in the zero astronauts skills in outer space.
The water simulates weightlessness.
If the adult water, albeit comfortable, but the alien environment for infants - native element.
Small ikhtiandry seemed to confirm - life on the land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months mother in "one liquid, it is easier to get used to.
In principle this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bathing, is only 2 weeks.
"This is a very little to something to forget," says instructor swimming Marina Aksenov.
In short, if a child born weightlessness more natural state, for women necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness dryakhleyut muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, falls ability to expel the fetus.
Oh well, skip it, relying on stimulants generic activities.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go on birth, it.
"And then what?" Asks not trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.
Not feeling of Earth's gravity, the body does not form a skeleton and muscle system.
The newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to dress in a special suit for training.
It will be deprived of what it will be vital.
"And this experiment, we will go with you, kept the birth of a child in the environment, will lead to what we on Earth completely dezadaptirovannogo man," foresees the head of the committee on bioethics IMBP RAS Igor Pestov.
Until the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a time, it will be a reality, when the earth on their ships will go on a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants, born in space.

The chief of the management: checking shvarts-sistemy failed through the fault of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, has lagged in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, vice president of the supreme security management of the interview for the website AK Tu N. Cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough," commented on the current situation Kala.
Such conclusions provides joint inspection of the Czech and German authorities control.
As an example of improper practices lead approach Peter Nechasa to the so-called shvarts-sisteme.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not disturb entrepreneurs audits - is prohibited or allowed?
"The law should be in any way set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister can not stand up to the work of the institutions, which compelled to check and seek the implementation of obligations," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the committee in the Chamber of Deputies you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, within the framework of which was the legislation on public procurement in both countries.
What exactly was it?
A parallel testing, which we started, probably, two years ago.
Simply put, the question is whether that European law says, how should be public procurement, followed by national legislation and then application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even if unfinished verification, revealed some interesting differences - in short, the legislation we can be "accurate and infallible," in practice, however, the use of certain parameters we concede Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more and more revised rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law.
As well as the project can help you, what it means for you?
A joint control can contribute to efforts to stop clarify laws, reduction and improvement of the restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive outcome.
Economy means getting appropriate things for reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and, possibly, criminal behaviour.
But not the fact that we will reach, reducing the limit orders.
This system "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find it much easier than if the restriction had not declined.
You talk about internal problems in the practical application of the law on public procurement.
But as a functioning control system in Germany?
If there is such an organization as our KRU (Kontrolno-revizionnoe management) or this works differently?
As for the institutions, as our KRU is re Ch, arranged in our principle, there is also the college, which operates a bit differently, but for the most part, both institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the authority to a certain extent similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of federal lands - - in their system is different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have a state means.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal calculation chambers.
As for the local law, there is easier than we have?
In general, I would not want to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany and can be used as a model, but we can not definitely say that it is better.
This is the case, because they are better at dealing with the control?
Definitely not, I repeat, such comparisons do not like.
But it must be said that even countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not have received any benefits from cooperation with our office, right?
Speaking of domestic law, as reflected in your institution of the amendments to the law on public procurement, somehow manifest consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not manifested itself in our work to control.
So as we carry out control in fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
Take this into account in the process of preparing future inspections - we started using our new tool to detect risk neekonomnosti ," through which we almost 14,000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There is, of course, these changes will come, because changing restrictions, changing the terms of some types of tenders and so on.
Do you think the approval of this law will benefit or additional strain on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and, I hope it is.
The problem that may arise, is that the rules "uzhestochatsya" and it will be impossible to comply.
The functioning of the previous rules controlled enterprises intertwined with the supplier (for example, regional operational programme - with the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means violation of budgetary discipline.
Whether in such a case, to tighten the law in this way?
I do not think that in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not to punish those who commit the formal mistake, not influencing the decision.
Such a system only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let's recognize that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the prime minister said that will not bother entrepreneurs audits of the so-called shvarts-sistemy. What does this mean?
"Shvarts-sistema" is prohibited or permitted?
The law should be in any way set, and, if he does something, then the prime minister can not stand up to the work of the bodies, which compelled to check and seek the implementation of the commitments.
You can say: "We have this law and let it," but you can not say that we will pretend as if nothing is happening.
The law on public procurement contains very strict rules, and it should formally be conducted, and it is the right thing. It will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it's tragic, when the candidate with the best offer disqualified only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough.

Shimon Ornest: at concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think of that, less than a month must come the end of the world?
This is just one of many disturbing news, to which we, the people, so it is easy to popadaemsya.
Together with a group of the tap tap we are kidding on the subject and say that we are the only group in the world, which will be able to collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you are going to give absolutely unique three concert against the end of the world.
Could you tell readers about it?
It is a national fundraising event, which we are planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential, which has the Mayan calendar, whose end declared on December 21, at 11:10.
The day before the event, December 20th, at 21:00 parallel start three concert in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They are gone, roughly speaking, at a time when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific time zone which 12 hours earlier than we have, will be completed May calendar.
Who came to head this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we are all together with our artist Gonzoj.
Apart from the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want, together with the public consider the condition of the world, we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the calendar we have created a unique collection of objects of the shoes, T-shirts, bags and original against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website of the www.e-tap.cz and thereby accord US support.
The group of the tap tap together with other musicians also sang the hymn against the end of the world, which is called "the end of the world is cancelled."
Sounds whether already fancied listeners YouTube anthem on these concerts?
Of course, in the end, if in the end, it and the end of the world will not come.
His singing all the artists for all concerts at the same time.
Hymns at the same time also live Czech television.
The words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomasz Ghana to participate in the performance also Xin DL X....
As you have begun to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other Czech cultural life, because we spend a lot of charitable events and concerts.
Try to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many would like to work with us, it is interesting.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for bezbarernogo educational center STUDEO, now in its sixth year we are working with civil association of tap at the Institute of Edlichki.
Teachers regularly attend school students Institute Edlichki and spend with them cheerful and interesting events.
The students themselves do not have the money to go to the teachers, and thus we try to give them the opportunity.
In the framework of the additional construction institute Edlichki in the future there will be a separate building, in which we are with this project.
At every concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to draw up a program that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will, support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Bart, the tap tap, Marjan and Jií Suchý.
Of all of the details can be found on the site at KP KS.
If you are planning any such grandiose events "in the future?
In May, will for the first time to perform at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we'd love to have representation in the Czech national House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
A group of the tap tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you cope with expensive in terms of organization and logistics??
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in the electric wheelchairs, their carriage should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes of instruments.
However, as with that without problems. Czech Airlines SA and British airlines British Airways have always been perfectly prepared for us, that I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without problems.
The abroad you can compare the different countries in terms of availability, public attitudes towards the disabled and so on.
You encountered to date?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where all works better than we have, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow a lot of barriers, and there is still in the independent movement of the electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also not in the course of such banal things as a give way to an invalid in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up advanced country?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance which far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement always depends on the efforts of the people whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid it is normal that people with a severe form of disability to move in the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere ...
There is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in that we have with them the tap tap a little!
Respect the public or bezbarernost is one thing, but at the moment when among us will well-known athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then really start to change.
This isolated cases - - people with a strong will.
The group of the tap tap is very popular, but back in two years ago, in 1998 you made to organize?
I entered the institute Edlichki as teacher and around me there were a lot of young people who wanted something to do.
And since I am a musician and play the saxophone, together with a colleague has organized an interesting music circle.
Well, over time, says our leading lad I Angelovi, a bit spun out of control (laughs).
The popularity came only in recent years, or I something?
It is true, we helped that we have begun to join the famous singers and actively working on the propaganda of the group.
We have come to the conclusion that the work that no one can assess, as a matter of fact as if does not exist.
Due to the funds of the European Union we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Whether standing in front of you a goal so well turn the tap tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, one another.
This is logical, all new is taken with caution, and lasts so long.
There is very little rare things, but I dare say that tap tap one of them.
The first impression of a man who sees us, of course, sorry, of course ...
But the pity completely izlishnya, because people with disabilities are not some afflicted with and all abandoned by individuals, whom we should pity.
They are people who can live a full life and evolve, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities something happens, this shift is not only for them, but also for the whole of society.
Provided the success that you strict head, what you believe many?
If we want to do the job properly, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think that it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and two times a week to learn that they have to go to rehearsal, to attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly losing enthusiasm.
But this is the same in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently group the tap tap twenty people.
How many were at the beginning of 1998?
Only one way I Angelovi.
We open Group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and will power, our doors are always open.
He will be held the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday, 20. 12, 2012 at 21:00.
The concert will take place at the stadium in the Prague Incheba, in Brno - at the club F Da and Ostrava - in the center of the p ly no JEM with the participation of the 12 groups and other musicians in the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert all three of the city at the time of the execution of the song of the tap tap "the end of the world is cancelled."
The purpose of this project is to collect funds in the amount of 25 million kroons to buy multifunctional bezbarernogo equipment for educational center STUDEO the Institute Edlichki in Prague.
A ticket to the concert worth 400 kroons, for children under 12 years of entry is free. Tickets can be bought in advance in Bohemia ticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic, which has become a full member of the European Space Agency on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and over the next years took an active part in a number of projects the agency.
But the way to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II Polish enthusiasts were flights into space, but it is not always seen with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, lectures A. Stern, who on December 6, 1933, represented in Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas of his pioneering work "introduction to the Cosmonautics."
The idea of a young engineer (1905.) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only doctor Jan Kostka Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France won the prize Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Luis for "Introduction to the Cosmonautics."
Dr Jan Kostka Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became the great propagandist, astronomy and space science.
He has published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to the scientific disciplines.
Became known world propagandist space, and his contribution was assessed including the fact that one of the craters on the reverse side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway, equipped with missile engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not clear even to break up or for braking carts had to be used rocket.
Information about the drezine known only from the press of that era.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to worry about the missile.
Study Section technology weapons in cooperation with professors Mechislavom Volfke and Gustav Mokzhitskim.
Of the remaining materials can be seen that research has reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops work was interrupted.
In 1937, in the specialized press had the idea of rakety-istrebitelya, which proposed engineer Rogozinskij, and the following year out work "air raketa-torpeda and aviation raketa-bomba" author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotskogo.
Both projects were developed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war all the projects military use of missile technology was involved in a temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (TYMCZASOWY Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated the work.
The committee was created in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the start of the war.
The next scientific work devoted to space exploration, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (to two YC).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November issue of the magazine's 1954 "problems," in which four volumetric published articles on astronavtike.
In one of them professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a society that will be kosmonavtikoj.
At the time, already gaining momentum projects of artificial satellites, and it was clear that space exploration is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of the 1956 Polish Society of Astronautics (POá) attempted to join the International Federation of Astronautics (based in 1951), and in the autumn became a full member.
And next year, the first chairman of the POá Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became deputy chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
In this post he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
From 1956 to and contributed to the development of a highly successful meteorological rockets RM (R Aki ETA o logic), which became the first Polish missile, fulfilling Shay scientific study.
The first type of RM - 1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
Rocket, capable to overcome distance 1800 m, was about 80 cm in length, and her weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently was built improved version of the RM-1A, and in the summer of 1959 on Bledovskom conducted tests of the two-stage missile RM-2.
The rocket was the length of about 1.4 m, and her weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile was already in a position to do the real scientific work - rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the high-rise wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The first missiles RM became rocket meteor - 1, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965 for years.
The rocket was conceived as two speed, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - kg.
Developed three types, designated as a meteor - 1, - 1, - 1 C), which were split by the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
Rocket meteor - 1 and had space volume of 0.4 L METEOR - 1 - 0.34 L, and meteor - 1 - 0.6 2 L.
The maximum flight range of all three types of was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 for years in the Aviation Institute was the development of missile Meteor - 2, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Rocket Meteor-2 with initial weight of 380 kg was able to bring useful cargo weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built version meteor - 2 N and Meteor - 3.
Should also mention the accession of Poland in the (Committee on Space Research) in 1960, and the creation of the National Committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of Inter space, Poland participated in the research of outer space on a Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Mirosaw Hermaszewski became the second Inter cosmonaut after Vladimir.

The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
Resolution caused heated discussions in society.
Certainly, it will be interesting to look at the issues from a broader point of view.
Liberalno-orientirovannye economies in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economies are in constant conflict with each other.
It has to do with the principle of free trade and free, is not restricted movement of private capital, together with raw financial speculation.
As a result of the significant difference in labor costs (wage) there is a price tension.
Under this concept to understand the condition when producer through the delivery of cheap goods is trying to stand in the economic competition that "the cost of a competitor in order to take a larger share of the market and, thus, to increase their own income.
On a massive scale this means for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result of rising unemployment in those countries where the cost of the labor force, compared with other, high.
Because private capital does not assume any social responsibility, including for produced them to unemployment, the growing the inevitable state spending on social needs.
In general, the situation strengthens the reluctance of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby offset the public economic and social damage inflicted by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that do not need to bring specific statistics.
Bestseremonnye methods of private capital create at the level of the economies of individual States situation, when governments are forced to enter into competition with each other, in order to artificially reduce the social level of its population in order to attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the government give own population at the mercy of private capital, despite the social decline.
First and foremost, it is reflected in the changes of the current legislation.
The goal is to economically to force his people to submit to the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result of the increased levels of poverty, and at the same time, and the difference between rich and poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany for several years, there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves own labor.
The number of these people already approaching one million.
In the framework of the competitiveness of the German economy is constantly occur cases, when employed by people get such a salary, that the state they should, that they have a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional workers of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU, of course, lead to the same state, in which people who are under pressure from the catastrophic collapse of social status, or forced to emigrate, as it did in the 19th century, or exist on the extremely low pay on the margins of society in the hope that one day the country will come to the private investment capital.
But may I ask you, where he will take?
If capital will come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turks, an Egyptian, African still works for the European share of wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media to nausea, argue that the state can not participate in the capital of their own economy, which managed the economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not management actions to interfere in the economy.
On the question to be answered if private capital does not work, now almost managing policy and the entire state, in their own selfish purposes?
One digit answer is yes.
Proof of the existence of virtually all able and the omnipresent Lobby in all states.
As a result we have a hopeless situation, corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits in the legislation, where almost all deserves punishment, however, is not a crime.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that the Public Ministry due to lack of financial resources like the development of bills private legal firms, which are tightly linked to the industry.
Then these bills approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the saying the constitution of the western type, and from the finansovo-moshchnykh groups who prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberalno-orientirovannaya democracy now quickly turns out to be in such a situation, as described Appianom in the "crisis of the Roman empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": "The state has been disintegrating, and departments are involved in the violence.
Bribes, illegal acquisition with stones and swords.
Taken och range and corruption flourished without any taboos, and ice used to go to the elections in advance sold voice "" ... decent people in the position of the ruler, in the end once the state in the eight months left without consul ....."" Began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose vigorous man ..." Appian thought that it would be a Pompey, but they became Caesar, who finally replaced democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by their own reckless interests without taking into account the public interest.
Private capital is already at its core is not intended for use in public order.
The present result is no different from the past: the demon approximate decline of elite without any efforts to reform the deeper character.
Means the cause of the rise of fascist and communist regimes we should look for in a reckless economic liberalization systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of democracy of the liberal type can be seen as a pause, after which it is expected the next round.
First of all, tragically, that the current elite completely ignores the consequences in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophe that we are seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from the old and new history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution, or at least, not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce social level of the population.
So this trend is systemic in nature.
The decision is a targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.

Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"The violence it will not work out, and can never get out," Sting, the "fragile," where the main verse are the words: "Do not forget what we are fragile."
"If my sons did not want wars, they would not be" dying Shnaper, wife Meera Amshela Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, as always, has provoked many responses.
Some advocate for Israel, arguing his position that he has the right to defend itself, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that racism of the state of Israel, genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel attributed to the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate about who in the periodically recurring waves of killings, the offender, and who is the victim, in the end, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and not have seen the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain, to see who primarily serve which continues for 95 years of tension (apart from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning backed by historical facts, some of them taken on the basis of my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is the history of the struggle for power.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
That is not so clear is whether these people are always completely independently take their own steps, or for their throne stood someone who guided their actions to set goals in advance.
We must admit that we are living at a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and leading the authorities could not for the life of one generation.
Among the wealthy families stands out one that could be regarded as the head of the octopus (I do not know whether or not someone over them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
Many of them do not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 1990s of the 19th century, to stop rumors linking their name with criminal actions in the higher areas, in the shadow of which they were, and that always fought to strengthen their power, in the multiplication of wealth or at the same time and by that, and to the other.
They are large packages of shares in almost all of the central bank of the world, and against countries whose central banks, they do not have their shares, they lead or preparing war (up to the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq was a 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the central bank of the country into their own hands).
Anyone who tried to resist this family, has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to preserve the status of the central bank of Rothschild's Bank of America, during the civil war, he began to issue their own (government) money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue their own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve), was assassinated in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the Fed over the outbreak of the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power in the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development plan three world wars produced great Mason level Albert Pajkom.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial domination, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (of so many slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume a lot of resources), creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be other than as a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
Method by which the working group of the world's richest families, headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent offer solutions (order ab chao, order out of chaos.
But these decisions are false and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the Fed, which was intended to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the first world war by the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed imperial Russia, by the Bolshevik revolyutsiiyu.
The first world war ended with a sudden, unjustified in warrior and economically Germany (there was no longer a need war for the destruction of the Tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there has been the separation of powers, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the second World War II, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, imposing huge war reparations to Germany than have created a prerequisite to the radicalization of impoverished masses, then had only given to the Germans strong enough, oblichayushchego guilty and offering simple solutions leader, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, of inciting the fire of the war.
At the end of the 19th century the Rothschild family provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above mentioned Balfour declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, have started to happen the first clash with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
The second world war broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler pulled out of the chains, in which he was initially kept bankers, or what he did, it was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was instigated by the military on the 2 nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a hearth war, the third.
If international bankers will manage to unleash, the Jewish people, as well as in World War II, will become a victim of the fighting on the front lines, now together with the Arab or, simply put, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, the source of contention and chaos is not only inside the country, but also at the international level (to take only a sharp division of the supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we have, international bankers people to vote in the election solely their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's Hawk is a typical example of a fascist, loyal international bankers politician that makes everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), threatened to turn into a world conflict, and given Iran's control over the Strait, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (ship corridor is only 2 miles wide), also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what the light now show up in the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept the new world order."
New world order in their view, is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy, naslazhdayushchejsya comfort.
A world where everyone born the body at birth implantiruyut chip, with which it is being stored under total control.
"And makes all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slave have on the right hand or forehead on stigma, so that a person who has not been marked with the name of the beast, or the number of his name, could neither buy nor sell.
Here's the wisdom: every person who has a mind, could calculate the number of the beast.
Because it is the name of the human, and the number is six hundred and sixty six.

The film "operation" Argo ": When worse, Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, which had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The US administration a positive outcome of the situation not to be counter-productive - she could not afford to throw out the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later strengthened by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations mediated by the government of Algeria.
Their fate has caused home a wave of solidarity and anti - Iranian sentiment.
Defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election year, ended the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, srezhessirovannyj actor Ben "operation" Argo "describes one of the episodes of the history, which brought America small victory.
Shortly before the occupation of the six embassy workers managed to escape.
After some serious troubles, they finished their way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities managed to take them away from Iran, helped extravagant I legend cover, according to which they rode the Canadian passports as members of the crew, ski existed in the country a place for the filming of scientific and fantastic epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendes, required cooperation of Hollywood.
Legend to be reliable, in specialized magazines wrote about the film project, people arranged press conference, fictional manufacturing company had a real office.
The details of the operation for a long time were held in secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film is a particular combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film-kinoopus," the story of a successful project, is an example can be a number of films about friends.
In the film constantly changing mood on the one hand, documented conceived scenes from Tehran (a subtitle shown significant historical photos of events and the way in the same situation have been demonstrated in the film is a big difference not).
On the other hand, light Hollywood passages, with irony and moderate an exaggeration.
And then the scene of the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the staircases of institutions, on the phone ...
Affleku remarkably managed to make a career.
The vysmeyannogo actor became a respected director, and his game has ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"The operation" Argo "his third feature film, the dark detective" Gone Baby Gone " (2007) and the thriller" The Town " (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film, which is not removed in the hometown of the director of Boston.
Sense of the atmosphere of the place at the same time is one of the qualities that earlier film director above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck is shown in "Argo," where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film are in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the entrance of the scene of the fall of the embassy impressive for its clarity, which also captures the emotions of confusion and that arise when somewhere suddenly changing history.
A similar effect Affleck and his colleagues reach in scenes of fictional (fake headquarters in the bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not imply a host of exciting scenes cinematic value.
He has been successful in working with this little, sometimes something - there it all comes not so elegantly (a scene in which a phone call in America prevents a looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and Chase runway looks seem pretty).
The lack of "Argo" is a distraction, associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues really very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are not alone in the film.
The film lacks a bit, this is a film that you can watch with moderate interest in assessing the performance and, thrillers of the Seventies.
But captures with difficulty.
However, it is enough for a reminder of one, still in a sense of living history, as well as for evidence of how exaggerated idea of and vseznayushchikh security services.

Rules fueling balloons, bananas and circus
Portal website Bank ov N IPO Plat Ky. Com, annually conducts the survey about the most absurd bank fees, now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd resolution or a draft of the workshop of the EU."
"We this last event, in which the EU plans to adopt a quota for women in the administration of large European companies," said "Law" organizer questionnaire Patrick Nager.
Among the already put forward for the nomination absurdnostej - the recent decision by the European Court of unification of the rates insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have benefits for life insurance for insurance companies, because they are objectively less prone to the risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU, people can nominate for the contest before the end of this year.
The vote will take place before the end of February 2013, "said Nager.
The controversial EU directives applies, for example, as well as a mandatory addition of the fuel, that as a result of damage to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable Mercury gradusnikov only because they contain relatively small amounts of dangerous substances, or directive about the size of the cages for chickens, as a result of the this year significantly tightened eggs.
Also criticized was subjected to a de facto ban on the use of the term "butter" or withdrawal of the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters in length.
Pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose position in Brussels usually protected by any state or group of states (the Czech Republic now even under the threat of the veto to stand up for the requirements of their banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, higher quality bananas in the European Union were to reach 14 cm in length and would not have dared to show ."
At the same time, the European Commission justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing disparate national rules that are complicated by trade.
The EU, despite the opposition of some states, all same softened standards relating to fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing Directive will lead to rastocheniyu products.
A candidate to win in the poll could be and last year's ruling by the EU, according to which sold balloons must be bathed by warning that children under the age of eight can not finagle them without adult supervision.
The EU has asked the American research, according to which balloons in the game are a potential cause of death of children through suffocation.
This restriction now applies to children up to 14 years, which is not allowed to blow in the trade fair dudelki.
Funny ideas are born and at home
Enough is absurd and rule, regarding the European officials: anyone who has the EU any official position, can not, given the delicacy of the issues for Greece, to use the name Macedonia, and should instead talk " (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Portal Bank ov pop LAT Ky. COM, in cooperation with the Association of liberal economists "principle of non-interference" (Let faire), suggested for the voting, apart from a few more of these absurd rules, for example, the EU's rule on the volume of food in the territory of the membership of the state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of supplies that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, set amounts of canned mushrooms, for which it threatened a heavy fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire also interested in the idea of pay some countries, because they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the statement about getting subsidies.
But these ideas have emerged in Prague, rather than in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage, because we do not have sea.
Ask the European Union about compensation, "said in the fall of 2004, then agriculture minister Jaroslav Palace (CSSD).
As the argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain yield, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases the state had full warehouses reserves that it was necessary to take out.
For the Czech Republic is far from ports, the EU, according to the palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of Euros.
As a result, the European Commission went towards the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for the subsidies offered to villages, the ministry of regional development, minister Paul German (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were supposed to go to the preparation of applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: bizarre orders are the exception
Although the Regulation in the Member States easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulation, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, in the opinion of many experts, deserve more recognition.
A serious problem, experts say, is the attention of EU grants to projects that do not have even a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States have made in discussing the budget.
Arouses emotions among Czechs and that, as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of their traditional products, and it is not always wins in this contest.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians have retained the name Olomoucké Syreky ," but" Tuzemskij rum ," whose traditions in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename the" Tuzemak. "
Rum can only products of distillate, of sugar beet.
The official list of registered products the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta and Gorgonzola, martsipanom of German Lubeck or ham, already turned out to be, for example, the Karlovy Vary, pogorzhelitskij and trshebonskij carp and Saaz hops.
The trademark of the EU can be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and gorzhitskie tubes.

People want me to spare the republic, but I'm a fan, "says Okamura.
Mr Senator, as a man comes to mind to run for president?
I do not think about to become a senator or president.
If we all in the country function without problems, then I would not ran.
But I can not see the country in the last 20 years, as is busy finding the thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I did not have ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something that I do not like, then try to find a solution, as change.
And since I was forty years old and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I do not have another opportunity to influence things, but to run for the post of senator or president.
You have got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Do you turn this way back to the people that you have chosen?
I always used to say that the key to the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the election to the Senate.
Later, I said that if I had chosen senator, I will run for the presidency.
My goal is not a post office is a tool with which I can make their views.
That is why I have the greatest influence and vast powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation Rop in a bar or watching television, but at the same time, ready to anyone who will try to change things.
To this are added to the media, which rights ochernyayut, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, said about me, that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri Paroubek.
Go to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with theses of material and criminal liability of politicians and the inverse of property declarations on the amount above 20 million.
To accomplish this, it is necessary to change the law.
You as president such authority, and only a Senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbied to conduct tours became free entrepreneurship, it managed to advance.
The problem is when someone comes with a good proposal on the left or right, he deliberately were being thwarted, which discourages citizens.
As an independent without party person I have much greater potential to obtain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I am without party raskladyvaniya order, without regard to the tenets can take each party that is best for our country, and to apply it.
Do you think of yourself as a man, more relevant to the right or the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that my people attribute more to the left.
For me it does not matter at all - a little bit to the left or a little to the right.
For me, it is important that we go forward.
It is not that someone refers to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good for society decision, whether it will offer or, and I am the same way against bad ideas.
You get angry when someone says that you populist.
But do you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And for that you try to get closer.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about is already operate in the world, or say about them prominent experts.
But without the support of Parliament you will remain only slogans.
And with that in politics you did not hold on.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other opportunities.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on their side, so that we have achieved his.
If I was elected president, would not have amounted to problems to organize direct TV broadcasting, in which I shall refer to the presidents of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in the case of refusal, will have to report it so it does not want to.
If there is a strong personality, which abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - - it was a credit pressure from the public.
Say directly that I'm a lover, not a genius and not intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and views.
I am only a beginner in politics, and for his program will try to get the support of the majority.
Things I am trying to promote themselves; if it fails, within six years and return to the private sector.
This is partly sounds as if Moore's eye must save the Czech Republic.
I'm no savior.
I know that one I did not do anything, so I bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to the Radimu Yanchure, he refused in connection with a large volume of work.
Also I at least supported leading investigative journalist Jan Lorenzo, which revealed fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy, because people really did, but now I feel myself the balance.
Sixty percent of the people do not go to the elections, and most of those who went to chose representatives of the establishment.
The Independent in the Senate only two.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be implemented with difficulty.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, for the direct election of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the basis of his own party?
I have not thought, because I do not have time to check the purity of the past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money to do so.
There is no money and on the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You do not have the money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how the situation is your own business with this?
Personal wealth is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a station in Prague will cost approximately $25 million, 10 million apartment, another apartment at 8 million, a collection of works of art by about 10 million, Aston Martin 3.5 million and Koda per million, and a few million on the account.
By the way Aston-Martin I appeared, because it was my malchishechya dream - I always liked James Bond, who traveled by car, was with women and at the same time, fought against the meanness and lawlessness.
You drive the Aston-Martine, own property in the 60 million and you do not have the money to the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but their own money particularly in this invest do not want to.
It is not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million on the campaign.
I have to inject themselves into debt?
In the campaign I invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I do not have sponsors, indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of pocket.
The cost of the campaign I essentially cover senator's salary.
But the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English school, which is worth 30,000 a month.
If I wanted to make money, so nowhere not ran.
So you will continue to engage in entrepreneurship, in order to live?
Do not you said that reduce these activities?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, its activities I partially reduced.
For example, managing director of the tourist agency in the spring will become my deputy.
People would like, that I was Bess N Nick, that will keep the Republic.
But I also have to do something for a living.
How much, as an entrepreneur, you are used to receive each month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, that get further.
And if I become president, his business would be finished.

The architects argue that the real adventures are not only in the imagination - example and his recently built the book Mountains - 2 photos
"To me this building seems to be fun, it seems, at last we again you can see something interesting," said Verkhajg, on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist the nearby large company, believes so: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: Why do we need another library today?
All have Internet, iPad, and electronic books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned library, right?
Spijkenisse, maloprimechatelnomu spalnomu under, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population numbers 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To deal with that unfortunate fact a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build the seven fictional bridges depicted on Euro banknotes, in the form of a spectacularly colored miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Blame Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau, master of bold diagrams and the author of the witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual and appeared on a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and the grin on his face.
And the members of the jury looked and shrugged shoulders, bold Maas of his original gift piramidku in size and completed it in defense of his project in the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here's my proposal: "book mountain" in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain $30 million Euros increased.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, Mail and several adjacent apartment buildings and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November "book Mountain" was awarded second prize in the contest "the best library of the Netherlands 2012."
The project also participates in the national Dutch contest wooden buildings of 2012.
Thus, faceless suburb, which previously could not offer nothing but the postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly beautiful city hall, the white facades that suggest the milk factory, wealthier the one modern piece of architecture.
But the most important in the Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this town of public building cultural destination.
The long road to book
First impression: Eldorado under the hood for cheese.
There is only one elevator, passing in the center of the mountain array, for real fans of architecture and reading choose to explore the area on foot.
Osteklennoe from all sides of the room is bright and easily foreseeable, the floors of bricks and elegant street lights accurately create a sense of public town square.
Urban environment perfectly.
View unwittingly looking for the bench, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"Usually bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle is the big dark hall, as a rule a comfortless and faceless," says wines and Maas.
We have set a classic configuration space upside down and dragged zone for reading from the inside out.
Inner space of the book Mountains used skillfully: in the center are located offices, internet-biblioteka, chess club, environmental center and technical facilities.
Especially delight black bookcases that serve as the finish walls, railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell of unusual.
Even experienced architects and lost in conjectures that kind of unknown material.
"We were eager to work with the secondary materials," explains Joop Trauborst, head of the project, representing the community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once on a single agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and on fields in the Netherlands as lining under the roots applied artificial material mm thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serves one or two of the season, after that, you can throw.
For the Library This painting - for the first time in such volumes - was panel four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure the so-called Lund plastic (K LP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, solid material, smell a bit like a new car and a little sneakers.
On top of the lead 105 steps.
Those who overcome path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in the literary cafe is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch kroketami and fikusami in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and in the first place the right humidity on the literary mount.
The cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but the building, in spite of the many glass surfaces, is a model project in terms of ecology," said Trouborst.
For his heating and cooling used heat of the Earth.
Although the book Mountain stands in a glass cage, even on clear days the sun gets inside only briefly.
Vast farms of wood, located perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take up a large part of the solar rays.
The climate in the room very nice.
The rest of the protection provide fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above skeptic of the of it, has already visited the new library.
Verkhajg also was already here.
As well as traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, which called Bukenberg "soul Spijkenisse, which long lacked."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate one book of own Assembly.
These books were to fill the empty space on the shelves are not yet fully equipped library - at the time it was 70. 000 books.
The idea worked.
Shelves to the top.
"There is nothing worse than polupustaya library," says architect Maas.
"I think that our invitation now every citizen in some ways connected with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it serves only to decorate.
Thus, M VR DV managed to solve the royal task, which in the professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And even if they are very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for building identity.

Szabo: "the Germans should play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the US and Europe, in doing so, Berlin is teetering on the narrow the diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: at the beginning of the week Germany first made it clear that it will vote against the application of the Palestinians to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany now need to be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position she also does not support.
Germany wanted to demonstrate their independence - not speaking too critical towards Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011 Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a forbidden zone for flights.
As a result, NATO conducted this proposal.
Germany is difficult to take a clear position on difficult international issues?
Yes, it.
The fact is that it is in the process of transformation of its foreign policy, namely transferred from the policy, which, so to speak, led the United States, to the German foreign policy.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no agreed common policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.
I believe that as long as they are only a part, but are on the way to "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which holds France or Britain.
What specifically means "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
This willingness to borrow in their national interest position, unaffected by the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is from exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests largely different from the interests of the other large states, and Germany must protect their interests.
Whether these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and to a vote at the UN?
First, Germany has a major markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.
So it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not attached to this is too much importance, it is not completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
On whether Germany and its relations with the United States, refraining making important decisions, such as the vote of Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of the German position.
So I do not think it was as dramatic as the Libyan issue.
Germany may even acquire so a certain respect.
After all, it signals that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, clearly voiced support for the veto.
Is there a divergence of opinion between the United States and many European states?
The American domestic politics such differences existed.
I believe that the Obama administration in the depths of the soul has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But the local political situation, the government, of course, can not hold such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion is not as significant as always seems to be.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not thrilled with Netanyahu's policies.
Is it easy to Germany to combine their close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier, if there was a single, a consistent European policy, but now it is not the case.
So they can not act as part of a broader approach and have to instead to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That's the way they do with the Euro.
I think that in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that for Germany, it is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel.
The issue has always been a sensitive.
But I think the Germans, it is clear that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player - not whether it will take a really major role?
Or leading role is still hard given Germany?
Germany is not accustomed to this, it still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, still is always hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the Euro crisis - every time when Germany takes an important role, manifested various feelings.
The Germans do not just deal with it.
In fact, this is an old problem: you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more precarious position than the United States.

"Protection of trademarks in China:" When PUMA and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is internationally known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren, too.
But what is Armani polo?
It is officially registered the name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms, the names of which it formed.
However, it will be protected as long as the owners of the original names not will put an action.
But then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
"Foreigners all the more difficult it becomes to protect their trademarks in China," said Thomas Pattlokh, lawyer Taylor Wessing, specializing in human rights in the trademarks in the Far East.
On my desk every week a new case of this kind.
Imitatoram enough to add a couple of letters in order to get the right to register their trademarks.
From Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
The same way legally copied German enterprises, such as sporting goods maker Puma.
Pattlokh opens the folder with records departments registration of trademarks in Beijing.
September 14, 2010, the Chinese company has registered a trade mark Z DF Puma, artificial name, which used the name of the fashion house er Gil do Z.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions copied and violation of intellectual property rights, it is well known.
In big cities are high-rise department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, the case Pattlokha not such. On behalf of their clients' he opposed to Chinese enterprises is officially received from departments registration of the trademark right to use the name, which is already protected by somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban minpaj" marka-passazhir.
The word is associated with "ban dakuan."
Call women who are hunting for rich men.
The Chinese authorities did not recognize the guilt
"This damages the business, it is necessary to fight," convinced Pattlokh.
"Trademark, unique position lost, image suffered tremendously."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries millions, especially in the case of expensive products.
According to the company's market research, China with sales of 15 billion Euros per year is the third largest and most rapidly growing market for luxury goods.
However, to achieve the removal of dubious records in the Register of Trademarks is difficult, and is it expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattlokh tells about cases in which the court dismissed several claims, as at the end of a long time oprotestovannoe name has become "reality of the market."
If the plaintiff does not lucky, he will have to pay, as damaged his trade mark in China, says Pat the Loch.
Sometimes there is ruled by the law of the jungle.
There is also a famous case of graphic elements.
In 2009, the company Daimler lost legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, Enterprise, which shortly before acquired firmu-proizvoditelya.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the Mercedes star.
Buying Volvo company Geely initially used the blue and white logo, looked like BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Producer fashionable goods La cost E lost in China of Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
Agency registration of trademarks of CT Mo in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to lack of personnel and equipment premises there have been difficulties.
But in the last year was "return from an emergency situation in the working process to normal."
So, the amount of untreated cases of objections has decreased by 22 percent.
It was closed almost 5 7,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
However 8 1,500 claims are still waiting for the production in the agency.
To combat this expensive
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
In the past year in CT Mo received more than 1.4 million applications for the protection of trademarks, almost a third more than in 2010.
This record and means that China is the tenth time in a row, headed the list of new registrations in the world, according to the agency.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million units.
In 2011 was paid 1.8 billion yuan fees.
If simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 Euros.
Appeal against its worth many times more, as it shows the German family enterprise.
For more than seven years the group is fighting against the Chinese.
The Germans managed to make the illegal production of counterfeit auto parts was liquidated.
However, fixed the Chinese rights to the trade mark.
It was his own omission, as surnames in Germany are not subject to the protection, says Hanno Venttsler, chairman of the board of the chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the agency registration of the trademarks of CT Mo rejected the claim Munich residents.
However, in both the following instances won, but stops the other side continues to struggle so far.
Need to be on guard
The question now is pending in the Supreme Court.
Venttsler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs are unlikely to yield accounting, the archive of the firm had to view even acts of a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, to no avail suggested adverse side of the "big six amount in Euro" for the settlement.
"It is clear how expensive it is to us," said Venttsler.
The danger of the Far East threatened to spill over even to Europe.
In the register there a unprotected trademarks.
So, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name for shoes and leather goods.
The group has long ceased production in these areas, but it was able to prevent the registration.
"It is necessary to be vigilant," said Venttsler.
Both he and lawyer Pattlokh recommend German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international provisions on the protection of trademarks, more foreigners should be "all that is in any way to protect, to register in China," said Venttsler.
Otherwise, it may be worth far more than registration.
Indeed, if you lose in the last act of his drama about trade sign, you will have to pay to the adverse party licensing fees for its own name, explains Venttsler.
Otherwise we drive away from the market in the unsettled segment.

World AIDS Day: pritoptyvat, sing, to help
Here in Heidelberg chorus Bong and in Swaziland AIDS orphans rejoice this.
The history of relations, to clear distance more than 87 33 kilometers.
First stomping cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, women's and men's tact on parketnom floor and quickly find him.
Raz-dva-tri-chetyre.
Only after that slowly growing voices of singers - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they occur, fascinate and follow each other.
And Hopf, 29 - year-old conductor, almost pops out of their shoes, when leads their flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, the Music Hall Institute of Medical Psychology here in Heidelberg chorus of Bong and is preparing a new song.
The rehearsal came fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from spetsialistki human genetics to the Porter.
"Om" Obani "is not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to a whole language: zulusskom, spoken eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to the evaluation of UNAIDS, the United Nations Programme on AIDS, there are about 34 million people living with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland population of 245 000 AIDS orphans.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzheni Association voices for Africa found in Germany.
70 of them attend school, gotovyashchuyu to further learning.
For 15 or 20 Euros a month, you can take the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch in Gogo-tsentre.
Imbongi the zulusskom language means narrator or voskhvalitel.
In this room do not fluent in the Bantu, but know how to sing.
Nearly ten years chorus once another song on this soft language and occasionally even takes them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers summer from, in the northwest of the kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple huts of clay and straw, among the residents of many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents, who died from the virus.
In the Esitzheni in miniature reflected the disease of Swaziland: the highest levels of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which reduces the risk of infection by half, the population almost not made.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland's population carry the human immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth dozen - is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before participants Imbogni saw many children on the streets, which lacked not only of parental care, but also just everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education a person in a poor country, there is no chance at all.
At first it was a private commitment to individual participants a few Euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get hot food.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "voices for Africa," which has since been almost professionally takes care of AIDS orphans in the Esitzheni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections,
What are the most important diseases, sexually transmitted?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper ().
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, the human papilloma-virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Lobkovyj pedikulez and scabies are STIs.
What are the main porazhaemye group?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, the transfer occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
The heterosexual adults often sexually transmitted diseases, are khlamidijnye infection, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papilloma-virus.
The spread of HIV among the heterosexual adults we have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among youth khlamidijnye infection are significantly more often than among other groups.
According to European sources, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years.
We have among young people also often meets human papilloma virus.
Changing the number of cases of infection?
Not all of the disease, transmitted sexually, are subject to compulsory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled since 1697 cases in 2001 to 36 98 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007 down.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth lower than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms point to the disease?
The infectious diseases can arise sores in the genital area, complaints, discharge, pain at the bottom of the abdomen, as well as the bubbles or sealing.
But often they are not accompanied by headaches and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, part of the bacteria sexually transmitted diseases, can be spread by contact infection and through close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular screening, especially with the frequent change of sexual partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and avoid remote consequences.
Patronage, donations, and last but not least fees for speeches choir throughout Germany allow something to collect.
"We have sent in Esitzheni, about 200 000 Euros," says Annete Lennartts, chairman of the association.
In the village of money from Germany disposes of Tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
It also takes care of orphans to be well organised, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they are called zulusskom old women, this is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took to to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their head and take care of the children in the form of every day on time appeared on the lessons.
Those who have no relatives left, go to the shelter to Khanijsile, lonely woman receives a salary from the association, as well as the two prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association "voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built two and together with the American health organization PSI organized surrender of analysis on HIV for many residents of the village.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so evident throughout the country, prefer deep silence.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," said Annete Lennartts, "because he has to do with sexuality."
Quite unusually for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, at a state style of life also lays the blame for the fact that the virus has spread so quickly in the past years.
But it is also the stray workers who carry the virus in the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annete Lennartts, "but they almost do not use.
Other culture flesh to flesh. "
Little to support cultural exchanges, chorus and B could neither every two to three years making a trip to South Africa and sings songs, full of sadness, a fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many in the southern region of the black continent know since the days of apartheid.
The bus full of white, who sing songs on the black language - such recognition not only brings in a good mood, and joy, but even happened, provoked tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
Trip leads the Esitzheni, where singers attend the sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village barely can be found on the map, in the valley of the River Etsulveni it is more than known.
"Go to Esitzheni, there is light," say those people.
The 8733-kilometrovogo flight back to Heidelberg, when topayushchie singers back in the hall on the street Bergkhajmer, you can see that the light is burning here.

Messenger: NASA opens ice at Mercury
The probe "messenger" found evidence that the planet Mercury is ice.
The ice sheets may have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
Space agency NASA of the United States proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the sun, there is also a water-ice: according to three studies, published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
Probe "messenger" found evidence that constantly located in the shadow of the region of the planet is covered with ice.
The thickness must be a minimum of 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water is a comet or asteroid, confronted with.
No one connects the opening of the ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific head of the probe Sean Solomon.
Temperatures on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how the water and other construction elements of life got in other places in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as "Phoenix," explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they are sent to Earth images: small in endless gave.
The image comes from the camera, which developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which is in orbit around the sun for Neptune, Ceres, under the new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."
This fragment of the infrared image "Spitzer telescope" is "family portrait" countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of a blue points, more difficult to identify in the Star Circle of pink "newborn stars.
This region of scientists neromantichno called "open" Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years away.
This iridescent heat dying stars photographed telescope NASA's Spitzer.
Similar to the doughnut ring consists of material that star fell away in the process of dying.
The giant nebula Trifid, remote in the 5400 light-years from Earth, of gas and dust are new stars.
Telescope NASA's Spitzer made this picture the galactic maternity Hall.
The stars of the Pleiades cluster, also called the "seven sisters," can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope colors are better.
As the red eye winks observer nebula snail at this infrared picture.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Resemblance to terrestrial continent brought this nebula nickname "North America."
The combination of normal and infrared photographs provides eloquent.
This new star in the beauty managed to photograph only with the help of infrared sensors "Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: as they emerged is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps the pieces of the moon of Saturn, which completely disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most precise pictures of the telescope Hubble: Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color rendering images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory photo shows the remote for a few thousand light-years three feed Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius.
Name three feed comes from the Latin word Tri FI DUS (three to Hall, three separate), as dark lanes of dust divided into three parts of the heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation of Ophiuchi astronomers photographed a harbinger of space collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth's core of two galaxies rush towards each other and inevitably face.
This is the birth of stars telescope Hubble "took in the spiral galaxy M 83.
The one who does not like the technical reduction, can call it the nickname "the southern Tsevochnoe wheel."
Photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cephei.
Nebula, remote 1,400 light-years, is made up of particles of dust, the size of which from ten to a hundred times less than the normal home dust.
The image was made up of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, remote 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called a Rp 273 photographed for NASA space telescope Hubble.
A large spiral galaxy scientists call was UGC 1810.
In this Star Nebula is the most vibrant group of new stars of our Milky Way.
Star cradle always creates new stars.
A starry cloud, United with socket, also constantly creates new stars at a distance of 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole is no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it appeared shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe mostly there was hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in the year Lippersgeem - even before the Galileo Galilei a year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes became more and more - and their view available space deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, telescope at Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, shown here, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, set the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space with the help of two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Gran Teleskopio" has a giant inner device - diameter of mirror is 10.4 meters.
Mirror the big South African telescope "in South Africa, for the sake of reducing the cost.
However in diameter it reaches approximately eleven meters.
Lack of inexpensive constructive implementation: Telescope tightly to seal at a vertical angle - it limits his mobility.
Telescope "in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His feature: high svetosobirayushchaya ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to terrestrial signals in space.
Radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the project, "the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), anybody with a computer can help by providing its computational power.
View of the European astronomical observatory service (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is a "very large telescope is fully appropriate to its name.
His four mirrors allow cover in visual pipe even middle infrared range.
The Chilean Observatory ESO also planned to install the European "very large telescope."
Its main mirror should raskinutsya by as much as 42 meters - and will be made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should be expected not before 2018.
Until 2007, both "the Keck Telescope on Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They installed two mirror with a diameter of 10 meters.
"The Keck telescopes" are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them also looking into the sky with the help of telescopes "Subaru" and IR TTF.
In addition, the Mauna Kea should be a new giant telescope with a mirror diameter of three meters.
Here you can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important types of space delivers "Hubble space telescope.
April 24, 1990, he delivers picture of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler "searches for planets outside the solar system - first of all, such possible life.
February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 12 35 candidate planets have been detected since the beginning of the mission.
The photos sealed last cooking space telescope Kepler ."
James Webb Space Telescope (JWst) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard rocket Ariane 5. "
The main mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: He must in the light of the first stars and galaxies look for big bang.
Scientists suggest that at the South Pole Mercury is ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this, "Messenger" revolves closer to the north pole of the planet.
By radar measurements over the decades, pointed out that the ice.
The 2004 zondu "Messenger" - - the first, which revolves around mercury, scientists are now sure of this.

Many residents in southern Azerbaijan reach a respectable age.
Even here there is a museum of longevity.
Search in a country where 97 - year-old seem still relatively young.
Trip through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
Minibus with rolls along a winding road past the overgrown with dense Forest Hills, turbulent rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is green and bright, that you might think, if you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
Live is one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which we know little, except that they are well speak Farsi and azerbajzhdanskom and differ in longevity.
The final point is LERIK, Azerbaijan.
Small town flaunts too heavy architecture of the Soviet era, which is not attuned to the beautiful mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost did not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku too utomitelna.
The 323 kilometers takes eight hours, as the road has only one runway.
Legendary wealth, which the country owes oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not gotten.
But Pilate Fatou (48) is convinced that Le Rica have something of interest to tourists.
"In May, Baku has become famous festival song contest - and next year we will host the festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatou.
She is the director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here documented biography about eight dozen of these sites, which more than 100 years. Points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years.
At the age of 136 he was born another child
But the controversial star of the museum is a sheep herder Myuslyumov, which allegedly was 168 years old.
Birth certificates, however, no.
And given the fact that the man, whose age is confirmed by documents, the age of 122 years, the age of the Myuslyumova seems extremely dubious.
"He was born in this region in 1805, died in 1973," explains.
A man has been married three times, and he was 23 of the child, at the age of 136 he allegedly was born daughter.
So if a sheep herder added Mu with Liu MOU a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about dolgozhitelyakh in Central Asia.
"Surprisingly many people old age can be found also in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Valley in Pakistan," said Scholz, "in Sardinia also lives very many very old people."
However, because of the lack of documents scientific proof of age is impossible, because there was no registers of civil status.
Every day a glass of baked oils
However there is the fact that people in the area of Lerika strikingly often reach biblical age.
Now home to 20 people over 100 years.
Why here, in the south, so there are a lot of long-livers?
Azerbaijani guide Fareed Mugimzade explains this special genes.
The director of the museum, on the other hand, believes that the nutrition.
Talysh people like meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink the glass of baked oil every day. But it is unlikely that such a high calorie diet can be healthier nutritional point of view.
Or the primitive lifestyle that keeps people youth? In Chengemirane, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, Azerbaijan, lives.
In 97 years it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
That claims 143 descendant, lives in a simple wooden house, a typical for the whole of the Caucasus region.

Under one roof here live eight people, including one of the sons and a daughter of long already have their grandchildren.
Also nearby two children.

The monthly pension enough for life
She always ate only what has grown in its own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I have never bought products in the store.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the Army.
The most difficult is was after the Second World War II.
But it was better when the "favorite" father Heydar Aliyev stood at the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of the old women.
However, the cult created around the figure of Father of the Nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan almost knows no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then the reins took his son Ilham.
However among Azerbaijani elders no poverty.
230 manats (approximately the same as the amount of Euros) and receives a monthly as a pension, for local conditions is the amount by which you can live well.
And, perhaps, long ago raised the son of too human: "the old man and in our culture, enjoy deep respect."

The word "human right" is absent in the constitution
The Revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo show the deep split in the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia, met fierce resistance.
Egyptian president not the pathos.
We must create a transition.
"And its success lies on my responsibility to the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was turned to all the people, but in the first place to the Christian koptam, liberals, enlightened Muslims and irreligious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly fragmented in the opposition, are in fear.
The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful "of the Muslim Brotherhood."
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily cut down the competence of the Constitutional Court and has expanded its competence, "to save the revolution."
But really wants to save the 61 - year-old engineer with a degree of doctor of the American University of Southern California, is not entirely clear to the Egyptians and the world.
Will there be deprived of the power of the judiciary?
In fact, 234 Article managed to smuggle in 15 - hour night jump of obstacles to Islam configured the constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and it partly cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the proceedings is based on "principles of Islamic law."
But what does it mean to "principles"?
It was and remains a matter of interpretation, and to fear that Islamists will use the formulation and arising in connection with her legal backlash for a more strict interpretation of Sharia.
At least, this suggests one of the newly introduced Article: in all matters related to Sharia, should attract the Council of the University of Al Achard, critical Islamist institution of the country, asset with great authority in the Sunni Islam.
This should not, but may mean that the clergy for legislation that de facto would have the consequence of the limitation of the judiciary.
The draft constitution much is subject to interpretation
Another problem: should preserve venue civilians military court.
These courts during the power Mubarak served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of dictator in military custody were to civilians.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "to maintain its morals and values."
Legally it is formulated so fuzzy, that government agencies with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of film and literature.
Open Text This means nothing other than censorship.
In general, no article establishes right equality of men and women.
But the other prohibits insulting the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is insulting and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Questionable also appears to be the wording that is prohibited "insulting people."
Is it enough to be caricatures of the president or jokes about?
The question of interpretation, as much in this project, which Morsi has a signature and that, he said, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians to a referendum.
"The revolution is back'
For several weeks formed the opposition against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back, and we win," said Hamdi N Sabbah, third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said that the draft constitution place "on the landfill of history."
In a short news service Twitter he accused supporters of Morsi a desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he declares referendum, we will go to his palace and skinem it," said oppositionist Yasser said.
"We have not yet tired, the blood of our brothers are not otmshchena," cited Egyptian media opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they do not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
Well organized by the Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for opposing demonstrations, but of precautions, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile to Cairo's University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the Salafis and supporters, who shouted: "The people requires the application of God's law."
They have demanded that Morsi: "The country!" And assured: "The Koran is our constitution."
The power struggle over the symbolic square, where it all began, triggered a state almost civil war.
Followers of Morsi, quite obviously, did not want to take this risk.
"The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft Constitution argued loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people decide the election ballot boxes, in which direction to go the country.
Most of the Islamists, it is considered resolved matter.
"The concept of" human rights "is not mentioned never"
Hafiz Abu Syed and fury of the constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48 - year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (ODA) defended the "Muslim brothers," when Mubarak sat in prison or before the Court.
Not because he shared their world view, but because human rights for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now, the words "human rights" did not meet in the new constitution, regrets it in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
The expansion of the impact of Morsi on all three branches of power in the state of frustrating lawyer.
These measures are a clear attacks on democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of to strengthen the civil state, the president of the de facto annulled his" regrets.
After all, without civil society organizations democracy can not function.
Feels that all left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This can occur.
In Tahrir Square warns: "You are creating a monster, which will not be able to control."

Norwegian rakfisk: the bad fish in the world?
The population of Norway is one of the highest levels of life not only in Europe but all over the world.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country somehow linked to the local addiction to one extremely zlovonnomu dish?
Take a few perezrevshikh pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there.
You get otshibayushchij smell the smell of rakfiska is one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours drive from Oslo.
Around covered in snow scenic views. This is a very beautiful, but in the air razlit characteristic smell.
Cancer Fisk is a trout, salt and B originated in water up to a year, depending on which Dushka need to achieve.
As the gathering twilight and Jolo gives, the crowds Norwegians collected at the festival, devoted to the, so to say, exciting dish.
"Her eat raw and aquavit, local tminnoj vodka," explains Khalvarsen, a local fireman by profession and a part-time rakfiskovyj General ," which leads the carrying out of the festival.
All around us people eat small cubes fish and its a lot of portions of alcohol.
"Someone like water in it than cancer Fisk," says.
This drink is able to smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If able to carry a piece of the nose, it's not so bad - differs little from portions of land, which you long was driven to a bus.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product of different times, times of poverty when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the fall of zamachivali in closed barrels of salt water.
Then deep in winter, when the fish already well and thoroughly zabrodila, and priglushiv perception of alcohol consumed in food.
In the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to flee their country in search of work and to emigrate, mostly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - - more than 13 per cent are immigrants, which are lured here jobs, high wages and a well-developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (long-standing rival, and it was not so long ago and far more prosperousst neighbor) massively coming here to work.
Rakfisk is seen as an important symbol, an indispensable, though a few smouldering element of the past Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, the expensive is a small glass of beer or sandwiches will cost you 9 pounds sterling ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world news, and most of the inhabitants of the country, it seems, suits.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the extremist right-wing, last year and 77 men, women and children.
Not mentioning his name, the attack called "what happened on July 22."
Citizens is very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens turned out to be capable of such atrocities and killings.
At the heart of today's prosperity is Norway growth (since the beginning of the seventies) one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity," said Anna, our waitress, trays with rakfiskom, a woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of prosperity.
We the people - as you call it.
Like most Norwegians, it perfectly speak English.
We do not love the show, we do not khvastlivy.
Norway very carefully drawn its oil is a big part of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years prior to the world financial crisis, when all the SOR or money, which they did not have, Norway is economical counting the costs.
"As long as you can to ski in winter and go hiking in the summer, it is enough for happiness," says Anna.
"And there is a cancer Fisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in the queue for any food - rakfiska enough.
Here is a burger with losinym meat is certainly exotica, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we will enjoy even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel hold a special dinner devoted rakfisk, in which visitors vote determine the best or, perhaps, the most fish.
Is direct, in which show leading bow tie, surrounded by plates with rakfiskom.
It is like the Eurovision song contest.
"So, Tor-Yurgen, what assessment you have set for best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, D, here's our assessment." ...
All laugh and applaud.
Someone falls from a chair, perhaps.
Or maybe just nadyshavshis smell of the fish.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto will have a tough beginning of his career.
The Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to join the office, the correspondent of the BBC will grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will have to face, and on mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Traffic in Mexico City now in particularly sorry state.
This city overloaded transport and in the best time, and Monday were erected steel barrier, pererezavshie several key roads to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was done in order not to give people to get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent participants in the protests to get to the building of the Parliament.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico's Enrique Peña Nieto sets presidential sash and will take the reins of the country.
Before him is no easy task.
Mexico has made good economic performance in the administration of Felipe Calderon, which now stacks its powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which for six years already claimed some 60,000 lives.
"My government says the people of Mexico about its willingness to deal with violence," said earlier this week, Mr Peña Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
To such statements next to the president of the United States political career of Mr Peña Nieto has evolved in the post of governor of his native state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in the vast state surrounding the capital of the country, the new opinions are divided.
Straight linear person
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is fondly remembered.
Residents put him in the merit revival of tourism, the development of the resort areas and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached on one of the new highway, built, Mr Peña Nieto, who dramatically different from the roads and pits, which were previously at this place.
A placard with his name hang on a modern building sports center and on an impressive interactive museum devoted to climate change.
"We associate with him hope for a real and serious changes," says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, congressman from the state led by Peña Nieto Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive change that is so badly needed in our country, in the first place in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party were relegated in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12 - year-old absence in the presidential palace of Los Pinos party has high expectations for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refuted charges, which put forward the new president of the opposition.
He is very straightforward and very devoted to the cause of realization of his vision of the future of the country.
This is a great statesman, and, above all, a man, able to listen to.
But in another part of the state, many people had a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad not, is a most striking contrast with paved streets Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under flyovers of highways, it is in many ways the city of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are too severe character of this metropolis.
Earlier this year for the pacification of gangs, drug trading in these areas, were involved troops; and violence against women is here particularly acute.
The near the vast landfill only in the last two years found dozens of bodies of dead women.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City at the time of Mr Peña Nieto is significantly higher than a similar indicator in the infamous proslavivshemsya violent city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name has become, when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr Peña Nieto, about him at best, it can be said that during his tenure as governor, he failed to cope with the problem of the murder of women.
In the worst case, his administration has been accused of full ignoring the problem.
A resident of concrete houses, like most of the houses in this area, Buendiya barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter Mariana moon.
According to the official version of the Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she killed her.
"When I got to her house, it seemed that her body before that," recalls Ms Buendiya.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body already okochenelo.
Mother tells the story, and a portrait of the daughter looks at us from the wall, where it hangs next to the crucifixion, where just one word: justice.
In this, they said, was denied this family.
"State officials appealed to me as with the old spletnitsej, narushitelnitsej calm.
They want people to simply accept on faith what they say, and pomalkivali.
But this is wrong, so you can not, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings, "she says.
The presidential sash on Saturday, the president of the Peña Nieto with it will take the tough responsibility.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico raised crimes of violence, and the new president promised to make a solution to this problem a priority during his rule.
"I hope that he will be exactly the same as President was the governor," said Olvera, congressman of Valle de Bravo from the PRI.
However, this is what is most fear families of the victims in Syudad-Nesa.

Bradley Manning not complained of mistreatment, claims the prosecution.
Prosecutors are trying to refute statements Bradley about the poor conditions of detention.
In the course of the hearing, a great attention was paid to stay in the military prison in Kvantiko, Virginia.
Protection requires close the case on the grounds that the detention conditions were brutal.
US army accused of kidnapping thousands of secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution attempted to show that private Bradley Manning, accused in the largest leak classified material in the history of the United States, failed to take advantage of many opportunities to file a complaint for mistreatment, which, according to him, he has to move, being in a military prison.
During cross-examination at the pre-trial hearing in Fort MEA, Maryland, a military prosecutor Major ash den feign said that record weekly visits to Manning and representatives of the administration of the prison for the first nine months of his detention in the Kvant and Co., Virginia, do not contain complaints about mistreatment.
Crossover interrogation as part of the consideration of the application of protection to dismiss the case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were brutal and by themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the day after Manning said that while in custody, he had intended to commit suicide.
A military expert in the analysis of intelligence data, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of kidnapping thousands of secret documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the website WikiLeaks.
Resource WikiLeaks did not confirmed that the source of the information was Manning.
During the hearing on Friday, prosecutor feign together with Manning looked at reports that after visits to Manning and representatives of the administration during his stay in prison Kvant and Co., where he was on a strict regime of detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During his visits to the prison officials asked Menningu questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor asked on Friday about the reports, Manning acknowledged that evaluates the appeal of the prison administration as "excellent," and the general conditions of detention as "very professionally organized."
Discussed reports do not contain complaints about mistreatment, in spite of the fact that directly asked about the conditions of his detention, feign says.
Manning said that he expressed oral concern about these issues and that his administration officials discussed these issues with him and have stated that they will, but not documented this in writing.
"They recorded" there are no problems " (after discussing my complaints), but this does not mean that I have not raised the subject in conversation," said Manning.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked why he complained of abuse to him in January 2011 during the meetings of the Commission, rassmatrivavshej suicide intentions, which he expressed in writing in a few months before.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to ensure that he removed the regime "prevention of injury" and softened conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that limited detention regime - a level lower than the supervisory regime in order to prevent suicide - - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the sake of the safety of others.
"I wanted to give the administration know that all right with me, so they canceled regime warning injury ... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and translation in Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at the naval base in the Kvant and Co., Va., in July 2010.
He said that thoughts of suicide appeared in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness because of the strong heat.
He explained that psychologically very difficult when you do not give to know, how do you solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
"My world has shrunk to a base camp Arif Jean, up to the size of my prison," Manning said on Thursday.
"I thought that I die in this cage."
Being Kvantiko, according to him, Manning spent most of the time in a small cell - at least 21 an hour, and often even more than 23 hours a day - in full alone.
Manning said that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, so as to sleep or even simply lie in the daytime forbade rules.
According to Manning, in the eyes he constantly beat the light coming from the outside of the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he perevorachivalsya in bed at night, he said, and were forced to go to the back.
Lawyer filed a formal objection over the illegal treatment of Menningom in January 2011.
In April 2011 Manning was transferred to the military prison in Fort Worth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning's statement, which he made during testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in the Kvant and Co., he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other prisoners during the morning test.
Manning said he did not have the opportunity to hide behind the blanket during the test.
Responding to the questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said that he understood from ordering a guard, that must throw a blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempts to show the officer that he is not a danger to himself.
Manning said that the officer said, that could use the gum trousers or slippers to hurt himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and eyeglasses taken from his cell.
His lawyers hope that Judge, at least, take into consideration the fact that he had to survive while in detention, and significantly reduce the sentence, in the case, if Manning is convicted by military court, which is to begin consideration of his case at the beginning of next year.
Protection said that it plans to offer Manning to accept the blame for less serious crimes, and other charges to challenge as excessive.
The resumption of hearings planned for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon argues that Manning had been detained in the Kvantiko in accordance with the rules governing the content of those arrested with maximum strict regime.
Among the charges brought Menningu, aiding the enemy, illegal promotion of the publication of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defense, and the kidnapping of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts, the issue of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.

My crisis of national self-determination the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left, because they remind residents of the country's difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that Mexicans American origin are caught between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City I went down the hall for coming close to the border control zone and remained on the ground.
Signs pointed to the two lines: one for the S (Mexicans), the second for extra Ros (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood in front of them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my life called Mexican.
It's just a code name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish people and friends from New York, and see themselves as Italians.
Later, I stopped complex design "an American of Mexican origin."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or respond to them.
But my vocabulary poorer than that of native speakers, and I can not get rid of American accent.
Because I took my American passport and was in line for extra Ros.
I remembered the story a few days ago, when the newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The order of the day stood usual for meetings of the presidents of these countries issues: immigration, drugs and trade.
The president of the Peña Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, in which the Mexicans now, with the same success, will be able to stay in Mexico, instead, to move to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the president of the Peña Nieto has promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals did not sound.
For Mexico's relations with the United States is hard and full of old grievances question.
Most Americans never thought about that, in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and under the gun rifles forced its leaders to give up half their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of the events in all.
It is only any U.S. statesman obmolvitsya though word of criticism in the direction of Mexico, in the press and among the elite Mexican society there are heard complaints that the Americans prejudice the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma preispolnyayutsya.
At the same time, the most complex are Mexico's relations with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about resentments?
Enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find in this country, and those for whom such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio so many people of Mexican origin only for one reason: at some point in their family history, anyone's father or grandfather "did not have the opportunity to realize their potential in Mexico and was forced to go to the North.
Most were Mexicans of a certain type -,, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember about it.
In Mexico, see otherwise.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we were in good schools and made ourselves on the good work, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination and it is not clear, but we know what kind of country considered.
The United States of America.
In addition, we know that the majority of the representatives of the Mexican elite and ruling class does not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of degrading defeats and refer to us as a people of the second grade, as to the Mexicans.
We are not well speak in Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico not strong enough.
Our very existence to them due to failures.
If our ancestors have succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not have turned out to be just behind the curtain, finding in the US life, but having lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and it reminds me of that, between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin, there is some friction - Mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin, it is a shame.
She is a citizen of the United States and believes that belongs to both these countries.
At the same time, many of my friends Mexican Americans do not feel belonging to none of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springs Tina.
Getting the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
In Mexico we Americans.
And in the United States we call Mexicans.
Now, as I discovered during a trip, as if our relationship is not intertwined, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want the Americans of Mexican origin worked a kind of Mexican ambassadors and represented its interests in the United States.
We could tell our friends the Americans what this beautiful country and how nice to visit, and be able to convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It will not work out.
Too many grievances in the past.
And, given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not believe that the country is so very beautiful.
Sorry, but with this themselves.
And this is true.
If part of the Mexicans still can not forgive the United States as they did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they would have to take and the fact that some Americans are of Mexican origin are still in grievances again for the way most recently in Mexico were treated with their relatives.
Yes.
Perhaps, we have more in common than I thought.

The old battle the New Middle East
Ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas group can be a fragile foundation for further peace
If it is possible to have a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sound, have become the usual, useless debate about who first began; many buildings turned to rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, issued from the territory of the Gaza rockets fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and the Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in the eternal conflict in the Middle East came changes.
To this can be interpreted in many ways, but the events of the "Arab spring" zakruzhili in the rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians and the Israelis failed to stay away from the vortex, the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this mortal impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, this situation gives no cause for optimism.
Even if a ceasefire agreement which was signed on November 21, will be occurred this week clashes have only strengthened the position of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, to complain that they forced Israel to retreat, despite the incurred losses.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas increases its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is working on them.
As the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world, Hamas new influential and rich friends.
Resurgent regional leader of Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, acted with the support of Hamas; its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamically developing states of the Persian Gulf.
Two, the victorious Hamas supporters say the around Israel Islamic crescent, from Lebanon to the north, which is ruled by paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, in which more and more about Islamist insurgents is about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and then to Jordan, where King threatened power allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous Arab country and important in Egypt, where the President Muhammad Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator, not udelyavshim special attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, are the organization, in many ways similar to that of Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic rasstanovkakh Hamas can become a significant player, whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the "tough" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israeli missile system "Iron Dome" justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of running Hamas rockets.
Israeli citizens can sleep in peace, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained committed to their unchanged position; many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis were killed from missiles, issued from the territory of the Gaza Strip, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part due to the wall, which comes to the territory of the West Bank of the Jordan River - a large part of the recognized a Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the set at 22 January elections - teamed up with even more offensive minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, very convenient.
What is the meaning to pander to the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If you give in their hands all the power in the territory of the West Bank, not whether they will start to launch missiles from there towards Israel, as do their brothers in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard to suppress any attempts to raise the head.
Perhaps the proponents of "hard" line will win; but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.
The Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, are not the most warm feelings towards Israel, their priority will be the internal problems.
Defense budget of Israel more than all of its Arab neighbors, combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of Arab countries to strengthen its own economy.
Pragmatism of the president of Egypt, Morsi, who together with Barack Obama worked on a cease-fire is a good sign and could well mark the beginning of the change.
Israel, not less, should take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.
As the onset of democratic change in Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that sooner or later Israel in the occupied territories, like bus, blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect is the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The violent operations, which are held every few years on the territory of the Gaza Strip to suppress the movement Hamas, have to pay the growing frustration of the international community.
Both sides need the outside
It remains the only solution, to which relentlessly call sober-minded representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of the two states and territories concessions to Israel in exchange for security.
Hope, not too impressive in the short term, "the hope that a ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence on the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which long time to make a decision to cut off weapons into the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, the best position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconciliation movements Hamas and Fatah.
This would make more for the creation of a Palestinian state, the upcoming vote at the United Nations, which may result in the recognition of virtual statehood of Palestine.
Its role is to bring Israel to the negotiating table, should play and President Obama.
During his first term, he has not presented its own plan for a peace settlement.
After returning to the White House he still demonstrates a reluctance to connect to the solution of the problem.
It disastrously position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the event of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia the law came into force on the unified packaging for cigarettes.
Warnings about the hazards of smoking and images of the stricken by diseases of the body parts stand out on the damp green boxes, identical for all brands of cigarettes.
The world's first practice Australian law on the packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing logos and color design different brands of the same box unylo-olivkovogo color with nasty snapshot of affected parts of the body, and images of children, whose health undermined their parents' smoking.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions, warning about the hazards of smoking, the only difference between the buckets, introduced compulsory this Saturday - name brands, which printed the same small print.
The most severe conditions in the world for registration of the packaging of tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia declares that the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this harmful habit of fashionable status.
The basis for such decision laid studies that people who do not smoke to 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
"It is clear that even in the very young children understand the meaning, which is trying to bring tobacco companies with the help of registration of the packaging," explains Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, referring to the research, that, for example, crown logo is associated in children with the idea of the princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the world's lowest share of smokers, so these changes are not specifically have a bearing on the profits of transnational corporations, however, the possibility of such measures already view and other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which would be sold cheap and available cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those who thought its initiators," said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Producers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For someone, on the other hand, the new laws contribute to the growth of the business.
Sandra ha of the small family company Zico import Pty Ltd says that the demand for and silicone, hides unpleasant pictures on the packaging, rapidly grew (almost from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in the High Court of Australia, where tried to appeal against the law.
According to Ha, Company Z ICO already implemented about six thousand products wholesale enterprises and expects a new party.
It's a good business for us.
Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networking among the part of the population, the aim of these measures.
After the adoption of the Australia A number of laws that have made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting sellers display cigarettes in plain sight, advertising of tobacco products has shifted to the Internet.
The Australian government banned local companies and Web sites to advertise on the Web, but it can not limit the foreign sites.
"If you trade tobacco and you only left this small loophole, the idea to promote their products on the Internet will seem to you very tempting," explains Beck and Freeman, and the next issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews on brand names, written on behalf of the supposedly ordinary users, the social networking sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question is whether it is a matter of the hands of the average citizen, who so loves cigarettes Marlboro, not spare effort and time and made a video, or behind this advertising campaign?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says that the industry is now more engaged in the adaptation to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry went even on such measures as sponsoring of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for challenging the new rules: These states show claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, saying that trade has undergone unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations with Australia all these countries are poor.
The WTO decision is expected by mid - 2013.
According to Thani P Lieber sec, the government has discussed with other countries the possibility of the adoption of similar laws on the packaging.
In 2001, Canada first introduced compulsory placement of photographs, warning about the hazards of smoking.
Now rule adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is seen in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia demonstratively not obey innovations.
These pictures I not graze.
I just do not pay attention.
"Just vykhvatyvaesh cigarette and pryachesh pack in his pocket," explains Viktor El Hague who buys cigarettes with a photograph of the tumor mouth on the pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me give up - this is my little daughter.
James, head of the store tobacco products king of the pack in the center of Sydney, argues that the same packaging has been complicated by the task of goods on the shelves
"I used the unloading of the New Party left an hour, and now four hours," he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then said: What is to be done, okay, it's over, close the shop," he says, vskidyvaya hands up.

In the world of electronic networks and permanent connections is not so bad.
This Thanksgiving I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our aircraft revealed mechanical problems and be replaced by other aircraft, of which we were pending.
Thus, I had plenty of time for reflection about the nature of boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and there is not much help no books, no magazines, no iPhone, nor even duty-free shops.
But recently, more and more scientists and specialists in child development support the idea of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to be bored is not so bad.
It forces the brain distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.
And because in the modern world we are constantly in front of any screen, the benefits of boredom they pass us.
Maybe we need to strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time.
We'll be back to that.
I, like many, felt that boredom is the invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tu, professor of Greek and Roman history of the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the fascinating history of boredom " (live ly: a History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history," he says.
On the walls in discovered Latin inscriptions of boredom, dating back to the first century.
At the same time, remains an open question of how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom often transform.
Having studied materials research on this topic and by asking the question of the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people "want to, but can not do that would bring them satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and, he says, is that the man does not do something that would like to do.
The apathy to do anything I do not want to.
Main the experience of boredom, he says, is a "violation of the attention and the associated deterioration in mood and a sense that time is as slow."
The description of boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that despite the possible link between the conditions, skuchayushchie people see the causes of the problems in the surrounding world and circumstances, and people outlive depression, see problems in the.
Sometimes it seems to us that we are bored, when in fact we just hard to focus on something.
In his study "unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in the September issue of the journal perspective on psycho logical science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues cite conducted earlier experiment, participants who listened to the recording of the voice, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds not related to the case of TV programs included in the next room, others have heard these sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly be dealt with, and a third group listened to the recording voice without any sound track.
Those participants who heard a TV with low volume, noted that they were bored, most of them found it difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons for this, and attributed it to boredom.
When we are trying to focus attention on a difficult or exciting task, interruption of attention can cause weariness, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Gvelfa, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something neinteresnoe, "for example, the flow of products on the conveyor belt in search of marriage, music can help avoid boredom."
It is believed, he continues, that when people start pokachivatsya on a chair or draw a picture on a sheet of paper, they do so from boredom, but now we know that in fact doing just help not relax physically.
"The study found that children who do not prohibit and go round, learn better and remember more information than children who require sit quiet," says Professor Fenske.
In some moments we all experience boredom: in the event of a delay of the flight (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an interesting film.
However, different people demonstrate varying degrees of propensity to boredom.
In the 1980s to measure such individual features researchers have developed a special "scale the propensity to boredom."
To determine the assessment on such a scale used questions and statements, for example, "much of what I have to do, and chant" or "me too much fun, so anything that do not have time."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers have determined that the boys more than girls, "says Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially with a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers often at all.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted by pager almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7 to 8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32% of teenagers said they bored in school and during the implementation of homework, and 23% said they bored outside the school.
At the same time, only 3 percent of parents said that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what would have been similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
But he knows that "adolescence peak propensity to boredom," mainly because children and teenagers are not allowed to fully decide, than they do.
Go back to my original question: boredom is useful?
Sometimes no, because in extreme forms it, studies show that can push people to the absurd and dangerous physical action, risky gambling or abuse of certain substances in trying to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers thought about the link between boredom and creativity, says Professor water, dedicated to the study of the problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that it is necessary to do something different; this is the boredom," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this is the brain does not always know what it is better to do.
If you will be bored and you send this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you make yourself better.
However, if you get to watch TV, you will be better only for a while, and soon it will pass.
So, if your child misses and you give him the iPad, he ceases to be bored, but he did not learn to deal with boredom themselves, or otherwise make in any other way to manage their time and employment, "says Professor Fenske.
"Such skills independent regulation uses in a variety of situations," he says.
Your child learns not only on their own to occupy himself something, he also learns to control at all.
I do not think that need.
However, considered it a bad not worth it.
Rather, we must learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agree with this.
"We see it is that we need more experience boredom, boredom is extremely unpleasant, the desire to do something meaningful," he says.
In fact, people want to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.
"In the modern world we are used to the constant excessive stimulation of the senses," he says, "and when the silence, we do not know what to do."

It is unclear how the new law will be applied on the legalization of marijuana in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, a 19 - year-old player football team and a student of public college in the southeast of the state of Colorado, charged with a criminal offence, essentially that will soon be completely legitimate throughout the state: possession of small amounts of marijuana and a pipe, in which he smoked it.
Mr Orozco says that one day in September, he was with friends in Lamar and drove in a car near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by police.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr Orozco came agenda to the court for possession of drugs and possession of device for drug use, minor offences, for each of them owe it to a fine of $100 and appointed date of the trial.
"We are treated as criminals," says Mr Orozco.
But he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted for the legalization of marijuana use in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much from the law as the place of consideration.
Accusations of minor offences related to marijuana, already removed in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which passed a similar measure.
Police stations already stopped nominate charges people under the age of 21 years or older for possessing small doses that would be considered legitimate, as only a couple of weeks, the law will take effect.
However, in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana, and still attract responsibility for the storage of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities to the suburbs of Denver to the mountain areas of the West vote to prevent the emergence of new in their places, licensed staff shops for the sale of marijuana.
"All of this is growing so fast that I do not even know what to expect next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in Washington state also puzzled about the head.
They will form the rules for determining the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all of this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, ahead of most other states in the settlement of the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
"In Colorado more than an orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," explains Brian. Smith, a spokesman for the council to regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages in Washington state.
But now no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith, than to put forward any proposals and hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent, which we could consider," he says.
Bill of the state of Washington, called I - 502, takes effect on December 6, and for a whole year plunging the state into a state of uncertainty, when the state licensing system do not, and the right of ownership of the marijuana already authorized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects to be addressed during this period, for example, how to find a balance between state regulation of "adequate access" to the licensed marijuana with a ban on trade it at a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergarten.
"It's very hard place licensed enterprise trade in marijuana in the boundaries of the cities, in particular in Seattle and its suburbs," explains Ben Livingstone, a representative of the newly created research group Center for the legalization of marijuana. "
On November 21, Police chief Oates of the Aurora sent out to subordinates e-mail message that the city prosecutor's office will no longer attract persons under the age of 21 years, to account for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stops ulichat people in these violations "from this moment."
Police chief Oates said that the police will monitor compliance in the city of rules governing the activities of persons, planting marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute illegal traders and distributors of drugs.
Prosecutor Weld County in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he said that the prosecutor's office will continue to be investigated for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage the use of persons to undergo a course of treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons charged with possession of less than two ounces of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations.
"Our institution has a duty to pursue the actions that are deemed to be criminal at the time they were committed," said Mr tank in a statement.
The response was controversial even in places like rural Mesa County, where the voters rejected a proposal for the legalization of marijuana.
Police Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer attracted to the responsibility of adults for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Khauttsinger supported the decision, but also decided not to take accusations on already open cases related to the storage of marijuana.
"I believe that enforce the law as long as it does not change is our direct responsibility," he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of the population of the state of Colorado, participated in the vote, supported this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different parts of the state of ambiguity in the relations between the local authorities to experiment of the State of marijuana.
"The district prosecutors in this issue, there is a cultural barrier," explains Sean MacAlister, Denver's lawyer representing the interests of the convicted for possession of marijuana, and the local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have been persecuted people for it, that now can not really come to terms with the fact that this is not a crime," he says.
Colorado and Washington - - the first states in which a small number of marijuana are the same as for alcohol is destined to become an experimental field in the scale of the country to test the idea of legalization of drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory legalized by trade, but at the same time, they are cautiously waiting for guidance from federal authorities, who still plan to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice to give in on this issue.
Despite several have received wide resonance arrests of traffickers and patients, marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases, made good on trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the bureau for the fight against drugs are unlikely to be in the house, to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to be to turn a blind eye to regulated by the authorities of the state of shops recreational marijuana, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser of the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some of the city in Colorado did not wait for the action of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administration approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, and so would not be able to open up earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, put forward for consideration by the six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in this position, that we give someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city voted against the amendment.
And now we have there is a contradiction between the results of the local vote and those that voted staff.
Still a lot of unresolved issues.

Petronella Uajett: I survived from Oxford, because I am a conservative.
Pre following university students for their views did not begin today.
As far as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best institution in the world, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium, zakladyvayushchij two foundations of civilization - and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the historical faculty of Worcester's College at Oxford University in the late Eighties, I gathered up their bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father could not stand it and cried.
Friends were get confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I threw college, because I did not like the fact that my and have sex in the next room.
The writer E. Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from cups.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran.
Yes, ran, because I systematically persecuted and intimidated.
It is not because of my rather unusual name or what I studied at a private school.
I herbs or only for one reason, and in this renowned cradle so light it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wye, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was conservatives.
You ask, why should remember about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, center-right views, subject to the same etching.
This and growing hatred of the studentam-konservatoram in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights, as one that is provided to the disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
The conservatives of student club Corpus Christi College in Cambridge say that their "often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and forced to feel unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They want to introduce to the Committee on Equal Rights college additional representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation is only exacerbated released recently on the BBC 2 documentary about politics in a student environment "country of miracles: young, smart and right," in which the Conservatives presented eccentric and.
The film was shown Joe Cook, a former president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, who travels in, wears a silver suit and a walking stick with a silver nabaldashnikom.
In other universities studenty-konservatory complain that they make "scapegoats because of raising the cost of their studies."
Luke black, 20 years, vice president of the Conservative Association at the University of Nottingham, in an interview with one of the Sunday newspapers said that "in the university environment increases distortion in the direction of the left.
People who we do not even know in advance consider us arrogant and with impunity children of rich parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of history faculty of the College of Corpus Christi, which were filed a petition on strengthening protection, calls the atmosphere "neuyutnoj," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, the new president of the Association of conservatives at Oxford University, says that the attitude of the members of the student club to formats center-right views significantly worsened.
"This is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for a normal life of the members of the club," she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was one.
I came there in September 1986, timid and shy 18 - year-old girl.
Oxford from hatred of the Conservative Party.
The year before university voting deprived the former Margaret Thatcher her honorary degree because of the reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even.
In the first days of the week, when students get acquainted with each other and with teachers, I felt for the first time that await me ahead.
I did not know that teachers not only watched through fingers on studentov-konservatorov, but also gladly took part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, privatization and opposition of the government to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - have slipped through the wooden panels of the wall audiences.
On my first seminar I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.
"Miss Uajett," said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, "Please, translate the first paragraph."
The text was given to me hard, I.
Harry Pitt was very gall man with a face like a cake.
"Tetcheristy fundamentally not teach French or they simply did not have enough brains?" He asked.
Other students.
In my eyes made by tears.
"I advise you to take a few initial lessons of the French in their free time, if you will, of course, is not very busy, rotating in society," probryuzzhal Pitt.
I returned to my room very unhappy.
That evening in college I was sitting at dinner one; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a student of the second course with the faculty of the English language, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative Association of the University.
"I know who you are," he said in a friendly.
"Unfortunately, it is as follows:
Over every, who is suspected of being supporters of conservatives, will be.
I myself is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most of the pervokursnikov-konservatorov pretend that they labour ."
Later, in the local pub, I timidly tried.
I insisted that agree with all that Margaret Thatcher says.
The trick failed.
Freshman of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of fascist pigs.
You are contagious. "
Other students picked up his words.
I was worn, dirty.
"As conservatives have sex?" Asked one of them.
"They like each other, right?"
I felt like, must have felt homosexuals to the abolition of criminal prosecution in the 1960s.
If I can ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or I will have to meet with like-minded people only under cover of night?
If I am forced to hide their true beliefs?
Upcoming me three years began to seem like a hell, full of hardship and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college, not his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He hated not only for belonging to the conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to the Thatcher on foreign policy and one of her speechwriter.
In college, he has not appeared.
He despised him for provinciality, and commitment to the Marxist-Leninist de term view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy," he said to me.
I travelled in Oxford from the parental home in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and Metropolitan friends.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He did not believe me.
During his studies in the 1940s there taken any political views.
"But in fact, it's the best university in the world," he said.
"There is not able to, not only in the city of slumbering Spires ...
Even my druzya-kommunisty always behaved perfectly. "
His wet eyes pomutneli.
"Do not pick up any hasty decisions.
I am sure that it's just a joke.
You struggle my heart, if the university. "
I was exhausted and regular trips to London and my emotional protection ultimately collapsed.
My friend, also a conservative, did not survive the pressure and abandoned their beliefs.
Next week at the seminar, when another teacher of history quite seriously called me "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
In the heart of shame, I admitted that "I clean brains parents," and called them "old fools."
Respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the coffin cover my career at Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time he wrote every week two columns for Publications, owned by Rupert MERDOKU.
My door was locked.
I did not leave, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I gathered a suitcase and sat down on the first train to London.
I have not returned.
You can call me plaksoj and cloth.
But in eighteen years no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.
The sadder that it was Oxford, which not only released Fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day, hiding the reputation of the university, in which the value equality and Freethought.

"Valentino prefers elegance of glory"
The exhibition, "Valentino: Master of sewing," which opened in London this week, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Tissen-Bornemitsa and other famous Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of the British Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, worthy to exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
The designer admitted this during the opening of "Valentino: Master of sewing," triumphal retrospective exhibition, which brings together more than 130 dresses high fashion, created his "home" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the history, the only character which - "Il signor" Garavani, but she could not be written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt a rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until 3 March, abound personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from the Princess Salimy Aga Khan to Lord Snoudona, including, the Princess of Greece, and Margaret, the Princess of the United Kingdom.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from modest tailor of the town of Voghera in northern Italy before the idol of the international "elite."
Be lovers in the Royal Courtyard - there is nothing wrong with that.
"They do not cushion their cigarettes on your magnificent carpet, as some do beautiful stars pop music," says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitsa.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino - Master and takes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We all really liked to come to his chalet in hell," former wife explains the Heini Thyssen, close friend of forgotten beauties like Mar Vella Agnelli or Eugenia.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of glory.
And despite this, he is a star.
Valery Matstsa, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Matstsa recalls charismatic designer.
One day we went to dinner to his home, it was after a fashion show in Spain's Square in Rome, many years ago.

"He never goes out of fashion, because his sketches is a real works of art," she finishes.
The parade of family trees
Life history not oderzhimostej, fully reciprocated.
He likes people with a good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries Somerset House was transformed into a glamorous podium sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: a visitor takes the place of models and should be on the podium, contemplating "viewers" of the dream that sparkle masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress, which chose the Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassisom, suit, which used the Monica Vitti in "night," or coat of fur and skin, which belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
The public of the models blestayut names such as Sibylla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway from Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino - like first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember it well.

"It was a gift, which he did to me," said Nati Abascal, one of the designer.
"Before reading the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because it highlights our beauty," adds the former Duchess De Feria, Badajoz.
I like the color, which he uses a lot of light and they "fit" to his face.
The proportions are ideal.
The princess and zakonodatelnitsa fashion Patritsia della Dzhovampaola d' Arenberg château, too, can not forget the first time in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I will age and reason to put on one of his evening toilets ...

I bought my first dress from Valentino, to put it on holiday at the Castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with frills, "" in the fold and neckline strapless.
"It was a dream became reality," said the widow Rodrigo D "Arenberga.
"Valentino indifferent to fashion, his passion is not temporary," explains the Italian aristocrat Ka, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.

According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone of high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the top of the world."
The drugged for many years "lifestyle" elite, now Valentino himself is the best representative.

"Always my attention attracted his finesse, his calm, his neat and impeccable appearance," recalls D' Arenberg château.
The last time I saw him a month ago at the festive dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He sat at the table with the Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.

The hardest profession in the world: miners with Kavakh-Idzhena
Four Euro Indonesian miners are risking their lives and health, vtaskivaya 70 kilograms of sulphur to the top of the volcano on steep trails
There are people for whom their work "Hell, while others are literally in hell.
Among them Anto Widjaja, one of the 400 miners, who earn a living prey sulphur in the volcano Kavakh-Idzhen, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day comes down to the very bottom of the crater, where sulphuric gas, rising from the depths of the earth, freezes on contact with air.
Otkolov huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, basket on his shoulders and carries them to the top of the rocky road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is meters, only 250 metres, but izmozhdennym gruzchikam required more than 40 minutes to climb to a snail's pace, barely keeping balance and carefully nashchupyvaya way to not fall over the cliff.
They know that one false step can cost them life, as happened with one from France, which collapsed a few years ago with rocks Kavakh-Idzhena.
Miners with Kavakh-Idzhena earn 5 Euro cent for every kilogram of sulphur, which
Once at the top, they pave his way between the tourists, who photographed them, as if they were monkeys of the circus, was carrying heavy baskets, stride three kilometers to scales that mining company slid a little higher, at the height of 1.8 50 meters.
It is about PT Kandy Ngrimbi, Enterprise, which operates with 1960 this volcano and, better not say their workers, which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Euro cent) for every kilogram of sulphur.
Then it it sells for 10,000 rupees (83 Euro cent) petrochemical industrial plants, after all, this mineral distributed in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching of sugar.
"As the norm is perenoska 70 kilograms, we earn about 46.000 rupees (3.8 Euros) for each khodku," explains to us, which usually performs three daily carry.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end of the feels exhausted, but they allow it to accumulate 138.000 rupees (11.5 Euros) by the end of the day.
It seems little for such human efforts, it is three times as much of what he would have earned in the field.
"The land fee to miners is very high by local standards, where the collection of coffee pay 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euros) a day and the average monthly earnings equal to two million rupees (167 Euros)," explains Loader, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was rupees (6.2 Euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but returned with his family in Banyuvangi, a town near the volcano, for a valid reason, which in Indonesia is as shattering as Sera: "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java, so she converted to Islam."
The asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly, and he tears eyes because of toxic gases
In his 27 years spent three years, risking a Kavakh-Idzhene, sulfur which has already started to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly, and he has eyes because of the toxic gases, which allocates volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"Two more years, because I want to open a shop or to learn Spanish or French," he promises more than acceptable English.
Life, this is a pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or porter at the hotel, but instead he performs work mule.
Dividing dirty wooden hut with other, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur not cease to flow out at night, when its distinctive yellow color turns into a blue and glitters in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, comes down to the crater, illuminating his way small lantern, podsoedinennym to him, which he bought for their money.
About 400 porters pulled basket with Gray on his shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company mining sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment, who work at their own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not get even part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 Euros), the collection for the picture, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 Euros), the guards of the reserve charge with tourists who come to photograph a volcano and its lyudej-mulov.
"This work for cattle, not for the people," says Badrusin, stocky, who spent 42 years on the Kavakh-Idzhene three decades, ever since I left college.
Able to raise up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will tolerate work "as long as it can," because he needs the money for the education of their three children between the ages of 18 and 10 years.
Do not go for retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur is burning throat and burned eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the dense pillars of smoke emerging from the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about its heavy disease ... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in his knees and ulcers on his shoulders, that de formed under the weight of baskets.
Balancing a basket on his back, Nick now only can lift a 50 kilogram in its 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades take 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three truck carry a warehouse in there Ansari, overcoming distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among.
"Do not go for retirement, die here, because the volcano is my whole life," says Unajnik, widely opening his mouth, which is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, a senior, 30 years, also works carrier of sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation is one of the most difficult courses in the world: What do human with Kavakh-Idzhena.

Singapore is looking for children to save economy
Singaporeans accused career, stress and prices for housing and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore to grow."
I husband a patriot, you are my wife patriotka, perform our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising pastilles, but despite this - or perhaps because of this - the video was a hit on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the rap, which uses local proverbs like "Let's put it Bao (roll) in the stove," to laugh at the level of fertility in Singapore.
Advertising agency, which has made this video, to entertain the hope that with the help of advertising they can draw attention to the issue in the entertainment form.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to people fulfilled "its national debt."
This thing exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce their kind, so we felt that this is the theme that we must address.
We knew that the government attempted to do a lot, for example to carry out the launch of spirits with pheromones or arrange quick dating (blits-svidanij).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why do not we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose a rap?
1.2 child
Who do not take it so lightly, so it is the government of Singapore.
It is spending $1,300 a year on policy for the citizens' enthusiasm for the birth of more children.
State package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, prolongs of maternity leave and provides tax breaks.
But all of this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech gosudarstvo-gorod in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict public control.
Fertility rates in Singapore, according to the national management by population, is now at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tang Wei Min, director of the Division of Policy for couples and families of the national office of population, says that the reason for this "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"This allowed people to have a wider range of options in vital goals and priorities, in addition to the wedding and the creation of a family," she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to a rise in the number of singles and postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in decreased fertility rates in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which seeks to a sharp increase in immigration to counter a reduction in the population, causing outrage among the local population.
In Singapore, there are Web sites, where rampant xenophobia many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, which is criticized for keeping wages low and the unwillingness to integrate.
Growth of immigration is seen as one of the reasons that last year, Singapore's ruling party has received the worst election result since independence.
After the election was an attempt to solve the problem, with the help of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in fertility has a known impact on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, an example of Singapore also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to not so much small housing.
For example, it is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
Guide to urban development has shifted to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box," which you can build in certain areas of the city.
These apartments 46 square meters sold very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute way of life and deprived of incentive to developers who want to build a large family homes.
But Lim Yu Sun, general director of the firm El developers, says that their "shoes" boxes sold much faster than the more spacious copies.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sold for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flow increased.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules give more clear benchmarks for developers, who had placed obstacles, if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too perenapryazhennye
Singapore is a city-state.
Although these new rules can be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking with Singapore members who work in the financial quarter of the center, it seems, that they will not have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, housing expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people this delay," said a young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have their own money and time," says another young man of 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent them to have a child.
So, as ever, the government has sought to encourage its citizens to the birth of children, with regard to childbirth, the final word to the singapurtsami.

Personal in offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, it is a private or property "sphere of private life, which have the right to be protected from any interference."
That is a personal for a minor under the age of 16?
He uses this definition in their daily lives and in social networks?
Whether he understands the danger of being in discussing the situations on the Internet, which certainly would not shared outside the Internet?
Elperiódico took an interview with five children from 10 to 15 years, the frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they were associated with the term "something very my," in a private jet, and "password and user name," when used it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I would not be downloaded in the post," said 10 - year Jorge, when trying to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it has accounts for two years.
"This is a very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not the whole world," he says.
The FB I beautiful pictures or pictures of the games.
Also I play with their friends.
"I would not have shared a photo that is not my, or someone who is stupid," he says.
Boy realizes that bad publish indecent photographs of naked people, crimes or writing offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures that knows 35 friends in the FB, and nine of their folloverov in Twitter.
Most of them relatives.
Mother to date, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I got Twitter, to express themselves and to write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if I meet, I only them," he adds.
"Social networking entertainment, I can talk with distant relatives or with friends," he says.
Without thinking, replies that would never have accepted a request from an unknown person.
Would not be with someone who recommended the stranger.
The case of 14 - year-old Jose is different.
The teenager is open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and ask, and the latter acknowledges that he did not know 20 people, added to his list of friends.
"It scares me, because we have something in common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one to him not vtiralsya in trust and not asked his home address or phone number.
"If I become pressure or demand, just remove them from your account," he admits.
Jose became a follower ask after reading recommendations on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to experience what is known as cyberbullying.
One familiar my girlfriend in the social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never found out who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to Jose, not deleted the account.
"Only included confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a way that is safe.
In contrast to Jorge, the boy would have uploaded photos acquaintances in uncomfortable or konfuznykh situations.
Yes, I would have done it, if people do not like me or if I feel like it.
"Although I know that cyberbullying," he confirms.
Key questions
Marelos Porras, English and expert on education and training, believes that, in order to guide children and teenagers, need to understand that the purpose of social networking is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game," she said.
Porras points out that academic mark Prenski, master pedagogy of Yale University and the author of the work of the digital natives and immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital Aborigines they, children and young people, who were born in the era of technology.
"We are digital immigrants, who have to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.
Explains that this topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a certain criteria of what you can or can not distribute, publish or speak, at the age of maturity, when there are not enough to do this."
"Also to be selective, while the most important for them to be popular, have thousands of friends, not thinking about the consequences," she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show that the privacy of children and adolescents, "to ask questions that make them think.
"Tell them that they did not do this, it is useless," she added.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things that you would not have told the stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, you would have liked, if published the photo you like the one that issued you about your friend?
Do you know that others publish about you?
When you photos from the parties, if you ask permission from other people, to mark them?
And another, all I need to know, what are you doing in each moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must behave online as well as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
"The Internet people behaving with respect, responsibility and other principles, should be in social networks," she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, professor of primary education and education consultant, explains the need for the heads of families in good faith, read the policy of social networks.
Understanding each of the points, they have a good basis for discussions with children about perceptions of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and allowed to distribute or publish," he says.
According to the key question is to remind children a lesson "do not talk to strangers."

"South America must learn from Europe on the issue of integration of citizenship": Rafael Correa
President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which the "South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), conducted in Lima, said Peru's state television that the Europeans "were killing each other during the second world war," and in other clashes, "but now they almost one fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the project of citizenship who approve of Member States Unasur.
"To achieve the free movement of citizens and workers of any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean Community, but so far there are reactionary sectors who want to bring us back to the past," he warned.
Ecuadorian president proved, in addition, a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the precondition for reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who lectures, never take any obligation, and we, the South Americans, on the other hand, sign it.
"Not understandable, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum given Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that does not regret the decision, because with him it is not their principles, and comply with its "profound values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time, "were certain suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be respected process."
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to arrive on its territory for questioning about alleged sexual offences, while the Swedish legislation considers it possible to implement it through video conferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. "
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said Ecuadorian head of state.
That really there is the danger of the deterioration of his physical and mental health because of the confined in a small space without the possibility to do exercises on the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the problem of asylum, granted Assange since June in Ecuador's embassy in London, through the provision of a guarantee of immunity, which will allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that negotiations were in London on the search for a solution to the problem of prison of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating about human rights, it is a word we do not use in this case, but there were constant debate.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because a lawyer for Assange, Baltasar Garson, leads a number of processes in different European instances," he mentioned.
And expressed the view that "if the United Kingdom tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, it will end."
And if Sweden, as it perfectly allows its legislation and how it has done in other cases, Senor Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London or the Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to show itself as a defender of the freedom of the press and stressed that he would not tolerate "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that distort the freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of freedom of the press is not damaged zlodei-politiki, and bad journalists, support, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In this aspect, he remained satisfied that neither of these journalists, "neither bankers nor Bourgeois Hegemony countries do not dominate in Ecuador," and added that, being reelected, "deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain veto Paraguay in Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "should be firm and will not tolerate opportunism and support coups in the guise of legality," because in fact "it has eroded the legitimacy of Paraguay's democracy."
Ecuadorian president considers, in addition, "perfectly legitimate" desire to his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos negotiate now with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of the maritime sovereignty.
At the moment the decision is not enforced.
It is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
Need to handle them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good end to the dispute on maritime borders, which are in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed that "the right thing for Latin America to turn to international instances, if the two countries are committed to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be."
Regarding the ability to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third term in a row, he pointed out that considering this possibility "with optimism and joy, though sometimes it's pretty hard."
Correa assured that if loses elections in February 2013, it will leave public life.
Personally I have never been interested in power, but in such unfair situations, as in Ecuador, social and economic poverty can be fixed only by the political power.
"My political movement stated that I guaranteed the probable victory, so you have to accept this responsibility," he said.
In the event of a victory that would be my last term in office of the president, and then we got out of public life.
If you lose, the same thing.
"This decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to the medical treatment, which has already been planned, routine, and that it is expected that he will skip the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean escalation of the state of health of President Chavez," he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.

Mortality from AIDS today is the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 when he declared that his analysis on AIDS gave a positive result.
"I was like," he recalls the difficult, despite all the tact of a doctor, moment.
The young man concealed it from his family.
By deciding to cope with the disease on their own, he wanted to know about it as much as possible and his efforts to materialize - he said his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the oldest patients VICh-otdeleniya Hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (hCG), where he got in 1994, having overcome many obstacles.
He lives with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 1990s, it would be hard to believe, too little then there were treatment options, too little is known about the disease, too biased treated patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he was."
In other words, in those days to have AIDS was sentence.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and to do so, not worsening the quality of life.
However, not knowing about the disease, many people still come, when the virus has already damaged, "depleted" their immune system and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
After 31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least after the first alleged cases, "a great achievement for the moment is that the survival of the patient, who starts treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population in exactly the same," said the head of the VICh-otdeleniya hCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information is confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific publication.
And an expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the length and quality of life depend on the degree of destruction of the immune system, available in patients with early diagnosis, the better the expected life expectancy of those who do not drugs: up to 30 years with the number of 200 CD 4, and up to 50 years, when reported about 500 CD 4.
Simply put, this means that the one who receives a diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25, according to these terms, "maintaining control, can live without problems up to 75 years," he explained.
To assess this progress, should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today the average is 76 years.
Although the mortality declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS, declined 6.6 78 in 2007 to 4.8 62 in 2011 annual report (UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients died in the national database.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and has already registered 187 deaths by May of this year; however, argues that there is a ubiquitous access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
Why still have a lethal outcomes?
"Personally, I think that the problem is not access to treatment.
So I should imagine case in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about his infitsirovannom condition, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He led the crushing data: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when we already have some opportunisticheskuyu infection; that it is necessary to do to have a greater impact on the overall mortality is to conduct a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples to detect on a massive scale, for all the people that it will be asked."
In his proposal to agree upon experts and officials of the State Council AIDS prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who asked to check in a private laboratory, only by the fact that it was his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi cancerous tumor, which is one of the more common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think that will die, and do not want to know anything.
"Time will still die, the better I'll be over and three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat almost well, do exercises, take drugs.
To date, his parents only know that he has suffered cancer.
I live a normal life, like any other.
"I work, I have a lot of classes, I travel, lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, to bother about itself and about another person," enumerated Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal life with mil en IO JAL I SCO, to encourage their statement of those who now, in the context of World AIDS day, experiencing fear.
Let, and if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible, whether they are HIV-positive, so it is better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
It is his message summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Big gap between the programs in the field of health and the simple citizen, believes Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from the city of Guadalajara, which involved problem associated with HIV.
And the biggest is prevention.

The ratification by the appeals court of the United States decision to abrogate the debt restructuring group Vitro, reached a landmark by competitive production in Mexico, a scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country, which has a solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of the firms that are Mexican laws are not valid in the country lanes and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In the practical sphere, approval of the judgement rendered on June 15, Judge Harlin Hale of bankruptcies in the court of the Northern District of Texas, leaves vulnerable Mexican firm in the face of the possibility of seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door leading glass manufacturer in Mexico for an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, resulting in evidence of three inconsistencies.
As of entry, while the judge of the case notes that lenders must be regulated by the Code of the United States Bankruptcy Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings for the competitive production, considered in Mexico.
The first point involves the cancellation of the international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises transnational profile.
In fact, to this end, was created United Nations model law on unification of international trade law, defining as an arbiter of American Law Institute.
Second, the verdict establishes that without mezhfirmennogo vote, recognized the critical mass of competitive production debt that were in front of the parent company subsidiaries of Vitro, would not have achieved the majority required for approval of the restructuring.
However, this opportunity to recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time, when taken this scheme.
There are half a dozen examples, among them Agremex and Mexicana, whose mezhfirmennye debts guaranteed federal Institute of competitive industries.
It is also true that you reading voices branches, one way or the other lenders Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the funds' vultures' like AU REL IOS Capital, AU REL iOS converge, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool limited, would not have reached majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
These data court of appeals.
On the other hand, he accuses vitro in a difficult situation, with which she faced since 2008, affected by a serious economic crisis, which the United States, causing strikes on the country.
So far, the family firm Gonzalez Garden claims to appeal against the decision in the court of appeal itself to the vote came to the plenary session, that is, five judges, in view of the fact that the vote only three.
In the case of success will be charged in the application for certification, which would require a review process by the Supreme Court, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, that the court rejected the document, directed by the government of Mexico in the role of AM ("friend of the court"), which described the process, which should be within the framework of the law on competition matters, indicating that he frees himself from the compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it with Article 15 of the law of the United States bankruptcy.
In addition, it is noted that the country complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for the interstate cases of insolvency, that guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.

Hector "Hetin Reyes:" Basketball was my life "
The poison basketball traveler Hector "Hetin Reyes" was more than 60 years associated with this sport and, through it, have been all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico keeps in the memory of so many basketball stories, as Hector "Hetin Reyes.
And after all, before the bleeding in the brain to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, in the small categories as a player, the player of the highest basketball league, the commissioner and the head of the Cowboys Bayamona and the president of the Federation of Basketball.
"I have done a lot of roles in basketball over the course of his life, including several at the same time, as when I was president of the BS N, director general of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during the visit Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, Puerto Rico, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes not exaggerates, making this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with many photographs and unforgettable things gathered for its a long way to go, show about it.
Bayamón, Puerto Rico in the heart
With big emotions he keeps those who remember his way through the Cove fighting since the mid - 1950s as a player until 1982, when the age of 15 years his performance in the role of the agent or agent of the contract.
"These were my best years, whom I enjoyed most of all, because they had the opportunity to be part of eight championships Cove fighting since 1967, as an agent, the agent or head.
Many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year debut in.
Since then, and continue to lead a "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, Germany, which was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "I have for you is a very strong player, rising 6' 7."
"Do you want?"
And it was the beginning of means and, one of the best players, who were in Puerto Rico.
Then recommended that Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our best.
I remember that said that if the means and brought the championship well, Gauss would help to win another.
Chempionstvom Cowboys with Gaussom I, but at a distance, because the 1988, already the head of the federation.
By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements in the national team.
Remember how we won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was to be bronze, if it were not for the Canadian judge, who made us beat the final game, Reyes said.
The team of the 1990 World Cup is the best team, what you ever saw?
It is among the best, as well as the one that won the dream team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was the one with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and defeated the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that we won bronze at the world championships.
In the team not only played again, Gauss, Ramona, Fico Lopez and' Pikulina' (), but also young (Javier) ' Tonito' colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario" Morales, who was unable to participate in the 90 year because of a knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but it has brought us a gold medal and a great joy, was the team of the Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like' Kanito' Nevesa, Pablo Alisea and young Rolando Khurruitnera in return players, temporarily estranged the mess in the Panamerikanskom championship Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level, as did Pikulin.
And this is without taking into account his career in different leagues, in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rica head?
This is a very complex question.
We had a very good young growth, which includes Julio Toro, Flora Melendesa, Carlos Morales, Raymond, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work Leo Arilly.
What would you consider your greatest achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995 for years, and that in the early 1990s was to 17 teams in the season.
You need to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, smaller categories.
For example, to the boys of Ponce played only in the field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoff.
Now guys travel and play too much, and it is unnecessary.
At least, I can see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my age on YouTube, enjoying their grandchildren and occasionally go to the basketball matches.
And, of course, enjoying the company of my wife, and C Abel, which has always been with me.

Begins course, which examines the "end of the world"
Every week students explore the apocalyptic phenomena, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this semester, when religion professor Stewart charm, decided to read a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had irresistible lure: the end of the long countdown "Mayan calendar, on December 21, for which many people seized as proof that come the end of the world.
But the charm had no idea that his expected in the next couple of months: a catastrophic hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddonom," and the growing conflict, which involved Israel, a place where Christian end times theorists believe that will start the apocalypse.
"I did not realize that it will be the most an apocalyptic semester of all," said charm of this week, students at the University of Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we are left with only 30 days, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic thinking.
And he is not the only professor, which offers courses on the topic of "The End of the World" in this semester, in theory, the latest in history.
At Temple University associate professor Barry in Acker reads course on "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Every week students explore the apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spread over time," he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain acts of man.
If nuclear material fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, polar war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films in the apocalyptic themes and studied how they compare with the examples of real life.
"I tried to tell students that is likely, plausible and it is impossible," he said.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of the history of Latin America Matthew Restall and his counterpart Amara Solari, associate professor of art history and anthropology, gathered to read a course called simply "The End of the World."
"We do not add' 2012', to always be able to read the course once again, in the case if the end of the world does not come," said Restall.
Despite the "destruction," students should learn to prepare projects and to take final exams.
In the Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse, that leaves students no choice but to work "to the same night, in which presumably will come the end of the world," said Restall.
Courses were quite popular.
"Place ended in two hours," said Restall about his course for students with high average, 35 students.
We have received messages via e-mail for weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked, is there still a place.
The students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to watch what people are doing, to console themselves," said Robinson, a student of the separation of religion and sociology of Khaddonfilda, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Kamden.
And an apocalyptic thinking, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or lack of it.
Will Vekesa, 25 - year-old student of the department of psychology and nursing, said that looked all the apocalyptic films.
"I never heard about the course, which taught this," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed - - not to mention the professor - - not to said that believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project touched on Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited," said Julie Zeglen, a 21 - year-old student last course in Templskom University of Uest-Chestera.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there is concern in Western culture, which goes back centuries, where people respond to changes around them, predicted the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places people do not think about it," he said.
Mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sal, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question about whether he knew of a course of "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines not to participate in the end of the world," he wrote, hinting at the disposal of the superior court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall drew attention to the fact that for a long time been said about the many days of the last of the court, and said that if nothing will happen on December 21, "People immediately begin to think about the next date" or that on December 21, is the beginning of a seven-year period, after which the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to that date.
Some said that they were going to go to parties "the end of the world."
"Maybe call someone from friends, to laugh together," commented on Samira Ford, 20 - year-old student at the faculty of communication.
