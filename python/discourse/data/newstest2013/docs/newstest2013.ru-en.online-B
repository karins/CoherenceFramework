The Republican strategy of resistance re-election of Obama
Republican leaders have justified their policies need to combat fraud in the election.
However, the Brennan Center said last myth, arguing that the cases of election fraud in the United States are more rare than death from a lightning strike.
In addition, lawyers Republicans counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States for ten years.
One thing is for sure : these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these actions partly discredited system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009 have introduced laws that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon has received new impetus after the elections in November 2010, which brought the Republicans 675 new jobs in 26 states.
As a result, only one was made in 2011 180 laws that restrict the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right of a voter registration on the day of expression and the right to take away votes from citizens who have a criminal record.
Before the elections in 2006, no U.S. state is not obliged to present voters identity card with a photograph.
Indiana became the first state, who made a similar demand.
The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the 2008 law passed in Indiana.
The republican authorities were quick to extend this and other states.
In the last two years they have initiated bills requiring voters to present photo ID, in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, we have 21 million people who have reached the required voting age do not have a photo ID issued by a governmental authority of the state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
In this case, the cost of obtaining the required identification is often greater than one hundred dollars.
New restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% African American, 15% of people earning less than 35,000 dollars, 18% of people over 65 years old and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years old do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Students - voters who are thought to vote for Democratic candidates in several states are not allowed to use photo identification issued by their institution.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mostly for Republicans to use the voting certificate issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011 more than a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly are meant to limit the vote of Hispanics.
It is estimated that two -thirds of Latino voters voted in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 legislation abolishing the registration of voters on election day in eight states.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This restriction was not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 election campaign for the registration of voters helped make a list of about 10 million people.
At the same time, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a drop of 17% in the registration of new voters in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed in five other states, laws aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total electorate of the state.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they constituted 24% of people who voted early.
Unlike whites, who form 76% of voters who voted early were among only 46%.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters to actively oppose the adoption of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were vetoed by governors -Democrats.
The action of the most controversial laws were suspended through the intervention of the Prosecutor General of the United States.
It is allowed to partially limit the negative effects.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules came into effect, of course, make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 election.
Critics decry the Democratic bias laws that have been adopted, seeing in them an obvious focus on ensuring that affect the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report from the Brennan Center in 2011 shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the presidential elections in 2012.
Only one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these actions partly discredited system of American democracy.

Screening for prostate cancer: take the test or not?
In fact, PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results lzhenegativnye and sometimes lzhepozitivnye which lead to medical intervention useless.
Men, and so reluctantly undergoing medical examinations, have something to begin to doubt even more.
To take the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were numerous cases of infection among the groups studied, so these data are difficult to interpret and difficult to work out any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time to a European, found different levels of mortality in those patients who were screened and those who did not pass.
The study also found after a 12- year follow-up, that the probability of metastasis is 30-40% higher than in those who did not pass the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend to take the test beginning at age 50, or 40 if one of the immediate family had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key point is to take the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to clarify the risk of his cancer, offering him options, without having to treat prostate cancer that is not life threatening in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active surveillance for the disease.
To date, many men whose cancer is detected, will not undergo treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease will progress, we begin treatment.
Increasingly, we define with precision the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo treatment.
So I would still recommend to take the test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to pass this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the test for PSA.

prevent Disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, compliance with a healthy lifestyle is the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all the people fed and healthy enough to move, 30% of the cancerous could have been prevented.
"If no one else is smoked, this figure would increase to at least 50%," - emphasizes André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of cancer.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer are quite inexplicable.
Canadian Association for Cancer tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes tremendous harm to people's health.
"Even today, in Quebec, there are 1.5 million smokers," - says a spokesperson Andre Beaulieu.
The encouraging fact is that 10 years after quitting the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
weight
According to CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the emergence of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and cervix.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," - added to the Association.
nutrition
The association also recommends limiting intake of red meat.
In very large quantities, it increases the risk of cancer of the colon.
Should be avoided as sausages.
Canned Meat by smoking, salting and drying can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"These may harm the cells of the body and cause cancer" - explains the Association.
vitamins
In recent years, many scholars engaged in research into the effects of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment the results of these studies can not be considered unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduced risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact of the development of cancer Vitamin D is also not clear.
However, Mr. Beaulieu stresses that their concerns and family history is important to discuss with your doctor.
"Letting the analysis does not lead to cancer."

Higgs boson in the details
Last summer, reported that scientists may have found the Higgs boson, caused quite a stir - and not without reason.
It is thought that this explains the boson mass of all particles in the universe, no less.
In addition, this is the last particle whose existence was predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or, at least, the "least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which previously could not be detected experimentally.
But physicists still do not fully believe that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical Congress in Kyoto, seems to confirm this, though to be sure of some data still lacking.
Imagine, however, that it is about the Higgs boson, as the chances to make a mistake seem minimal, and see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law completely unavoidable, stating that the two things can not be in the same place at the same time.
To bypass this rule there is no way, do not try too hard, or do harm to himself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this nature : the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles can not occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - a "state" is, in general, some of the characteristics.
Accordingly, physics separated particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find the good citizens, called fermions, which wisely obey the Pauli principle.
In the other bustle bosons vile band anarchists have no respect to what - at least to this principle, which means that they can be quietly in the same place at the same time.
As the site (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure Berkeley Lab, these bosons are divided in turn into two groups: mesons, which we will not be here to speak, and "particle forces," which are distributed by the main forces of nature and to which in some ways is the Higgs boson.
These same bosons, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson : the photon, or "particle of light", which is "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle having an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "breaks" the electromagnetic field in that particular place, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "infringement" is born an electromagnetic wave (light or infrared radiation or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing like the photon - and therefore one of the bosons "vectors of force."
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that for this boson appeared to be "violated" the other field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field, to excite him, to achieve a very, very high energy, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large rock.
That's why a huge particle accelerator, like the one operated at CERN - The Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - To achieve such enormous energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson mass.
In fact, not all the particles are not all the materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets interact others - no: paper, for example, never itself will not stick on the fridge.
Similarly, not all of the particles interact with the field Higgs those that interact are mass while others (photon way) it does not have.
So what does "can bring" all of these studies, asked Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows the physicists to find the discrepancy between observations and forecasts CM.
In addition, some of them crave to such a discrepancy was found, because the slightest discrepancy could open the door for "new physics" and plug some holes models.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings without offering any explanation for gravity (ouch!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oy-oy!).
But while at CERN, such differences are not found.
aftermath
The benefit of this research to the daily lives of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that it is not.
See : In the early 60 -ies of the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not even imagine what a revolution will cause them to work.
They foresaw their applications in science, but not much more.
In fact, now deceased physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where in 1960, the laser was invented, and that he developed the first continuous laser (previous were pulsed) in 1962, said that initially the laser was considered more as a "gadget lab."
Imagine...
And besides, the application can be found for instruments accompanying the study.
For example, the same Uilliard Boyle during his optical studies in 1969, has developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it does not have its original purpose, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras of the world and earned the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it just goes to show, in fact, that it can be.

Palliative care - the best way to die... | "Debt"
In the Commission for a dignified death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of end of life.
Debate to resume soon, but at this time preparing a bill.
Nevertheless, in this critical area, much remains to be done.
"Duty" tried to get a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his apartment in Monterezhi.
Prostate cancer is destroyed from the inside, gave him a two-year reprieve.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," - he says, between life and death, lying in a bed in the shelter of palliative care Victor - Gadbois in Belay, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it is impossible to prepare for," - he said.
The disease does its job : the incredible weakness that does not go to the toilet independently and even to eat independently.
Sitting at a table on which there is a tasty lunch, he gives in and agrees to help him eat.
He is willing, even manages to smile and talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, lead him into the bath.
Courage in the normal death.
"My greatest wish is that I was cured of diarrhea, it is humiliating," - he says.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this disease.
"Over a lifetime, we are taught that a man should pee standing up" - says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the shelter Victor - Gadbois.
Regress to a state of a child - for some unbearable humiliation.
"Everything depends on the person's ability to" come to terms with the demise - he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people involved in palliative care, important events sluchayayutsya and in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enroll in hospice palliative Victor - Gadbois, all have cancer.
Forecasts by assigning them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, a team of doctors and nurses do not provide more aid, called "treatment."
Mrs. A., 89 years old, most of all afraid of dying "in the minds of suffocation."
But the disease has allowed me to get to know their children.
"I have good kids," - she added.
"That's all I want in life," - she says, before allowing her to put a mask for breathing.
She is still waiting for a few days last visit to his son, who came from Italy.
The shelter Victor - Gadbois by a group of volunteers provide care for the body and help with nutrition.
This is palliative care, which is when nothing more can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11 700 inhabitants have one place in palliative care.
It is very small, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions as possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors shelter.
Whether it's physical comfort, emotional or spiritual.
Dying we agree to provide oral rinses of brandy or Pepsi, depending on what he asks for.
Diabetics we do not force to control blood sugar.
And death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought the beer to Mr. H., who died last night.
In the morning, his son drank the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones, as well as patients," - says Nathalie Savard, Director of Nursing.
The shelter Victor - Gadbois no day is like the previous one.
Next to the 93 -year old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on their cushions during a toast in his honor, died tragically young man 36 years old, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and pereprobovashy everything to survive.
"In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45 years" - anxiously says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients taken to the shelter Victor - Gadbois, come home, and 47% of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, to the care that is provided to ease the suffering of patients included in the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as shelter Victor - Gadbois and the Society of palliative care at home Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively to the care of cancer patients.
It's this big gap in the Quebec health care system leads many doctors - specialists in palliative care, to fear a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October circulated a manifesto signed by luminaries in the field of palliative care, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapuantom and testifying about their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to quality palliative care before will be allowed to transfer to euthanasia.
Recently, - she says - I saw the patient, who spent 14 days in the emergency room, in terrible pain, and no one has taken the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I 'm afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists to the last day trying to save the patients, despite the pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for the survival of Ellen Richard has been minimal, when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stop treatment, she replied to me that he was sorry that I stop the fight, - she said.
However, she told me herself that my days are numbered!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel suggests that 90% of patients who ask about death, thank medical staff for what they have not fulfilled their request, after a team of palliative care eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care in the Society of palliative care at home Greater Montreal, patients are susceptible to pain management in 8% of cases.
At the very end of his life the doctors often resort to palliative sedation in which the patient is asleep until his death, or from time to time, or permanently.
One can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain, can have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain, always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that does not necessarily mean "I want my great euthanasia", it means "I want to make me feel better."
Creating this story was made possible thanks to a grant from the Institute of journalistic Health Research Canada.

Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, building contractors, builders funds of political parties and experts in the Italian Mafia, day after day tell what they know about the colossal "system" entangles the construction industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and mobsters.
"Industry", which is very costly to taxpayers of Quebec, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"I wonder how this system falls apart after having been put into the case by all means, jokes Jacques Dyusheno, MP and former chief of police of Montreal."
Thanks to him, in 2011, a scandal broke out as a side result of the investigation of malfeasance related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Prime Minister at the time of the Liberals, Jean Charest, has agreed very reluctantly.
"Report Dyusheno" established a direct link between the industry, the secret funding of political parties and corruption.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he said, only one Department of Transportation would save a billion dollars in contracts," if some restrained their instincts to take share.
Charbonneau Commission "has shifted the two mayors," he added, hoping that it will "open the circuit behind the individual personalities."
Constant unit to combat corruption, created in 2011
For the case was connected created in 2011 Constant unit to combat corruption, compiled of the extensive state government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, by a special unit "The Hammer", which after 2009 made "cesspool cartel" of Montreal, to stop overstating the value of contracts.
In recent weeks, has been made a series of raids, and some municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte - the mayor of a small town, was charged with fraud and corruption.
The next step - Gilles Vayyankur, recently retired from his post as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in Government orders.
In addition, formal charges were brought against a number of service engineers Railways Montreal and construction contractors Italian origin, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito.
Last detonated a bomb, telling investigators about the "system" get government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts awarded in Montreal, certain intermediary associated with the Mafia, which, in turn, transferred money Party Mayor Gérald Tremblay "United Montreal."
In the 2000s, Zambito littered money right and left. He listed more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to different parties province, mainly liberals, who was then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party of Natalie Normandy.
Sewer contracts in which overstated the value of
Monreale B "systems" korrupcii practiced bezotkazno.
Syurprenan Gilles, a former civil engineer, described it in detail before the committee : in the ten years he has received from construction companies gifts, invitations to travel to golf tournaments, in restaurants, at hockey matches and bribes for a total of 736 000 dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he overstated.
Other officials, responsible for the construction of roads, said they received the paw by overstating accounts for 30-40% with fake supplements.
Zatem Odin organized around parties mэra, Martha Dumont accused Mr. Tremblay in a volume, chto on namerenno zakrыval GLAZNE of sushtestvovanie parallelynogo budget napolnyavshego partiynыe kassы gryaznыmi denygami.
After these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging into a deep crisis of Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members in Montreal, who scored the alarm.
The mayor of the county Riviere de Prairie to the east of the island, it is opposed to the 2010 sale of municipal land, purchased for$ 5 million and resold for... 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, it "will pull the thread that allows to understand the functioning of the system, infested by ants to stop the gangrene and identify those responsible."
This process characterizes it as a "painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigation team and the observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How do we clean the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Dyusheno notices for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but it is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about the scheme," but did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec is 70%, he joked : "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to$ 100 donations to parties, but, as he said, it will not change the situation: "While we do not strictly limit the elective expenses, politics will be dirty money."
It requires a complete overhaul of the system of public contracts and the financing of political parties : "We can not go below; boldly penetrating into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a solid foundation, with better control and legitimacy."
If this story and casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Dyusheno encourages those who laugh, look in your own backyard...

This season you are in Paris Saint-Germain have made an extraordinary scale.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by the individual consciousness, but it can - and a new dimension to PSG.
Profits are great players.
Next to them, I am growing every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me every day to raise the level of my game.
And during the game, it's easier.
In football everything happens very quickly.
But I do not inflame.
From the beginning, in the center of preconditioning in NIF Klerfontene and before I came to St Etienne, I always stepped forward.
This way, you get the benefit of competition, the installed Carlo Ancelotti...
Replenishment of this summer is nothing new to play games is very high.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me, eager to be on the level, and to do your best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti has supported my positioning.
He is assisted by substituents such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti - master of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti commands respect around the technical staff.
Today in the First Division he has no equal, and it's one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he won many titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think it will bring new titles Paris.
In January I had with him was reassuring conversation.
Then I continued with a series of injuries.
The confidence that he has me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the season PSG?
In the First Division Lyon took us the leader.
But we are still at the ready.
One of our main goals is to Champions League: we effectively qualified for the eighth finals.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
We will be able to have their say face to face with a very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group in front of the port to be able to take the second leg in the eighth finals.
Can PSG become a first class European club in the short term?
He has to have a budget that is already...
In order to become a major European club Paris to win titles and consolidate the position for the long term.
Today it is not.
Financially at PSG have the means to make this project a reality.
Do not take the title in the First Division, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we want to get really hot this title.
Last season we were close to it.
In May, it was frustrating because we had it all to reach the finish line first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
Typically, 79 points implies the championship.
But the other team, Montpellier, has played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be okay.
Despite the fact that the fight for the title came such strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux, I think we have the strength to win.
Do not you think that the media are waiting for too much from Paris Saint-Germain?
It is normal to expect a lot from us, considering how much has been invested and what our players.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we are winning 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find what to criticize, of course, it's a little frustrating.
We ask ourselves, what are primarily expected from us humans.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
Перевод этой языковой пары (казахский > английский) пока не поддерживается.
We are trying to implement a project of the game.
The team is formed with time.
We have proven in the Champions League, we can respond to the challenge.
Look at Manchester United, which has two seasons, you can not go to the eighth finals, although they also spent a lot of money!
Given the amount invested, we have represented for 15 points ahead by the winter break.
This would be a disregard for our opponents and for the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height of last season, had been "woken up" by this new PSG.
This shows how exciting League.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to myself that, despite all the difficulties, as a result we won.
PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say that there is a "Zlatanozavisimost."
It only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came to this, and he proves that he is the star of League One.
Wherever he played, he showed that he is a great player and a global star.
In the group we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
It stimulates and others improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, and motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 against France?
How disappointing.
It is my fervent wish to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me to snatch a bit of playing time.
I saw a lot of things, and I came out stronger.
Today I am able to play a good qualifying matches.
This is what I hoped for since my baptism in CT.
We have learned from what happened in the Ukraine, and is now expected to behave in an exemplary.
What do you think about the first months Didier Deschamps led the Blue?
They are for him effective.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He was a strict coach, it is close to the players and the inspiration for the victory.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I would not want to compare.
Blanc has reached his goal, he qualified us to the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will result in the Blue Brazil.
Well deserved a draw (1-1), taken out on October 16 in Spain - is a fundamental match?

Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current money exchange, based on the central banks, numbered transactions between the parties receiving c fee to process them.
Furthermore, as is often the case with these technologies, it is obvious political vision : the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), while a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and protected by the type of communication protocol BitTorrent, which allows you to transfer files between members of one level.
Approximately 200,000 operations have been reported with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites accept Bitcoin donations to carry or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin exchange rate, reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later dropped to$ 2 before returning today to around ten dollars (courses listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special in comparison with the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, issued in October, became interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro," and "like a normal currency."
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "loans" are used to promote a video game that are earned in the game or who might buy (and sometimes to exchange).
Social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But the exchange transaction is always in control and process a central authority.
In all the Bitcoin network nodes are both holders of the ledger, auditors, issuers of exchange, buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is really going on between the two e-mail addresses, like e-mail.
Only for each new payment, you can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information relating to this transaction shall be signed electronically, using an encryption system with double key.
The network may also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file is possible to check that the Bitcoin used in the transaction, do exist in the public account books sent out over the network.
A key step is to register a new transaction in the book.
It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem, sent out by computers, decided that, if temporary central bank, is granted the privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about the phase of the hash file, ie the transformation of a large file to a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction number and add it before "hash" all together.
The goal is to find a number that gives a unique digital signature (the number of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes are easy to check that it is correct.
The transaction is thus effectively connected with a chain nerarzryvno all other transactions, any modification will change the digital signature.
If tricking the user very quickly (in less than ten minutes), wished to pay two times one and the same theme of money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would have remained unconfirmed since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer decides to challenge gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly divided in half, probably before the end of 2012.
Number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred million, that still leaves a reserve...
The challenge is also increased with increasing processing power.
Life network has experienced ups and downs.
Sites that provide services to Bitcoin, were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
"Use the defect does not apply to the protocol itself," - assured Noisy Pierre, who recently launched Paymium - the company makes payments to real money using a network of Bitcoin.
The ECB also informed about the possibility of money laundering through that this anonymous service.
But cash also have this disadvantage.
The big players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the blog platform WordPress, they are allowed to.
Nedabiah Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron throughout Veytsmana Institute in Israel proanalizirovali schetnuyu knigu and obnaruzhili, chto almost 80% bitkoynov not bыvayut in turnover.
"Giant sale" were announced in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works in Coinabul, which is engaged in converting bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noisy, another author of the manual for this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions that way is cheaper.
The owner better control their personal information and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
One need only provide the address, which you can "take a picture and recognize" the phone, said Pierre Noisy, assuring that it has been around for thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise the hierarchical systems in favor of a more horizontal.
"Before Bitcoin be established, it may take a while, but 2013 could be a turning point," - he predicts.
The ECB, in its report suggests, by the way, to reconsider a variety of risks that are considered higher today, in the event of the success of this system.

What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans have to follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army is time to regain control over its territory, and for the Afghan people to choose their own future and not rely only on us.
Our affected mostly Afghan farmers, we were treated like terrorists.
And we, with 88 soldiers killed and wounded and maimed.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from farmers who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was in the Soviet Union.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They suffer, they sometimes help local rebels, but they will no longer be, as soon as the West will behave more sensitively.
Care of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees due to French credit, took place in the order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the late 2014 invasion of the Taliban in Kabul will not.
Circumstances have changed since the time of their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
While Kabul was empty, the country was in flames and blood because of the struggle between the different factions.
The capture them under the control of the country then was perceived as a kind of liberation, return to safety.
Afghan women have paid for obscurantism of the peasants, in which they surpassed Al- Qaeda, but the situation has not improved and in our days.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the Taliban present are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war, returned to power in 2001
They have turned into speculators, exciting public land to resell them for building returnees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of the huge American subcontracting contracts.
They discredited, most of them, by the way, do not even fought.
People, as I heard in the countryside, they want a government that would consist not of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave as those who managed to American generosity : the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during his exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25 years, in Kabul, there are 5,000,000 residents, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are filled, both boys and girls.
Need to provide jobs for those young people who do not want to go back to no obscurantism of the old parties, nor to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed rebels, like mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that constitute the modern world, and who look everywhere.
At the moment the army is.
Power that would be her command, will be considered legitimate?
Old commanders were leading the anti-Soviet struggle, are already taking steps to restore the provincial teams who would not obey the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences should be decentralized to some extent, on the model of Western countries, but the United States would like to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly before elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country since the 50's, and even earlier, dependent on foreign aid.
Industry was not put on your feet, no dam is not functioning, no irrigation system is not repaired.
Everything is imported, nothing is done, other than fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by thirty years of war, government control over the infrastructure would be needed.
It was rumored that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
This has reinforced the feeling that the Western countries were present there, only to take possession of them.
Without energy for the processing of iron ore and copper in place, with no means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese had almost left the Mes Aynak copper deposit, leaving the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig out a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary to one day equally Afghanistan and Pakistan, from which depend largely on imports and exports, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops ended on 20 November.
The new co-operation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional care: high school for girls, for boys, Department of French at the University of the French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, support for archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "win hearts and minds" and perform the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the service is "civil-military activities," the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, with a small French public organization, which has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intense involvement of the local labor force could help contain the rebellion : irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and to increase the area of arable land.
What we leave on the memory of himself, spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget has promoted to improve the living conditions of the local population is very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for the implementation of small-scale agricultural activities emanating from the local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of uprisings led by foreign groups, farmers what they want, they told me to give them a small non-military support, which would be well controlled, and came to them directly.

Difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is the new risky move President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of constitutional declaration that temporarily gives him extraordinary powers, he decided to play for broke.
Catching everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly will vote on the final text the following day.
A week ago, the head of the state Assembly has provided two additional months to finish the job.
It will soon be two years since Egypt is based on the preliminary text, which was amended several times, weakening the institutional stability and lead to legal controversy.
This new initiative has strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, President persists in his "autocratic delirium", continuing "to break the word" and "trample on the right."
In the camp of his followers believe that it is a way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum shall be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time, which makes the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain the Egyptians text article by article.
For the President, it is also a way to restore the social and democratic legitimacy, while dissatisfaction is raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi, seems to believe that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with U.S. weekly magazine Time.
The more so that the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people : "Either you vote for my text, or I leave myself emergency powers" that are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere of 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for text.
Most liberals did not respond to the call.
In mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to communicate their views.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities and civil society to do the same.
To make the necessary quorum was reached 11 people, spare the participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, most of the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, was amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day came around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the clock of the Constituent Assembly were set incorrectly.
The text on which the vote was still going yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of everyone's attention, Article 2 in the end remained identical article of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
Salafist party, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the basic requirements, hoping to replace the "principles" to the "rules" that would enable them to more rigorous use.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed, is a testament to their good will and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" - are responsible liberals who see this as a PR.
Because, in their view, the Islamization of the Constitution is through the other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220 , which gives Al-Azhar University advisory role, particularly in regard to the verification of conformity to Sharia law.
According to the specialist on Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is alarming, because "people called to make decisions that are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy."
We can observe the emergence of a theocracy. "
Many liberals also thrilled by the fact that following the rector of the university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text - it's not ulema, and people with a university education, some were trained in the French system " - quiet Alexis Bloe that preparing a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "around Article 220 may be ambiguous, since the terms used in it are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to the "fiqh" [ Islamic jurisprudence - approx Ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as civilian judges are competent to make decisions about it. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday, has been criticized because it gives wide powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claim that they are much lower as compared to what was under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will not take place in Parliament, and the National Council of Defense.
Also, do not be denied the trial of civilians in military courts, despite the request of the Association for the Protection of Human Rights.
The latter also expressed concern over the text, which they consider detrimental to freedom.
Retained responsibility for blasphemy, and now prohibited offense, which could have serious implications for freedom of speech, and especially to the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles are no longer talking about the protection of women, highlights Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive aspect is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word that does not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was to speak last night on TV, demonstrations are planned today in the afternoon.
Supporters of the president, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.

"The great and mighty" to bring Moscow : Migrants are saving money on the tongue
While MPs and human rights activists argue that the law will give the mandatory language test, the country has emerged scammers selling "fake" certificates
Every year in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia come 13 million guest workers.
For the most part it is the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal - to earn money to support families back home.
On December 1, by force of law, according to which every migrant worker will be required to pass an examination on the Russian language.
While this is true only for those who intend to work in the service industry, housing and utilities, life and retailing.
However, with time, - promise to FMS - tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
Besides, it is necessary not only to take the language, but also the history of Russia, and the basis of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to confirm and to receive, and to extend the work permit.
The exception only applies to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Not subject to the law and the people, who are already receive certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The good, the doom and protection of human
Network exam points will operate under the auspices of the Institute of Russian Pushkin, Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University, and other Russian universities.
Migrants are able to pass the tests in all the cities, now in Russia, opened more than 160 such centers.
The initiative was supported by the introduction of testing and the deputies of the State Duma, and FMS.
But human rights activists before the law came into force, many times in the press had time to ask the question: what is, in fact, give us?
What is necessary to change the language and knowledge for the Russians, for themselves and visitors?
First of all - meet representatives of the migration service - it will reduce the number of people suffering from a "labor of slavery."
A lot of talk now about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, says the head of representation of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow a 90% solve the problem of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, not knowing the language, not having a medical examination.
Without understanding the language - sure Sebelev - is doomed to face the future worker with unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping him stick in "ticket" to a spooky close hut, where he and dozens of others like him will languish for months without food or documents, grinding away for 12-14 hours per day.
We get a lot of complaints from our workers.
"At home, they promise one thing, but on arrival they are cheated, deprived of their passports, do not pay the promised wages" - confirms the Head of labor migration in Tajikistan Tolib MS Sharipov.
Not ruhaysya, nasyalnyka!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, intending to work in Russia, recognized that not only do not know the language of the country you want, but on their own, then write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, how much trouble is few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a sensible primary education.
After all, even their families have nothing to feed my children, not to mention the fact that they wear well, put on shoes and equip the school.
Grow into adolescence, these guys are at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult, if poorly with the knowledge of the language - they are recognized.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the law on language rights activists point out one important point.
Testing will be conducted only for those workers who have legal status.
If the status is not - there will be no examination, no further official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers are still living in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No Trespassing"
Many visitors claim to be made official in our country is not so simple.
The reason - a bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization is worth the money : 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But the false registration can be done quickly and in just one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we basically false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"Ask a hundred, two of cigarettes, tea," - shared with reporters a Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov.
"Flown, do not be stingy, buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language that the fake are not only migrant registration documents.
Several "fake" certificates of passing the language test is seized by the FMS.
Fake papers are printed on a standard color printer.
Of course, they got new owners not for nothing : each of migrants who hoped in this way to ease the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official testing procedure : it will cost migrant workers in three thousand.
The fact that the main task for the near future - protect the system from corruption to "crust" could not just buy converge and government officials, and human rights activists.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers, have not been able to successfully pass the test the first time, the time to learn the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not speak Russian, will be offered in the areas of work that will not require active communication with people.

MIA does not take into circulation illegal arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is extremely small
Russian Interior Ministry proposes to toughen the law against the owners of the civilian weapons.
This is the authorities' reaction to the recent incidents : Press shots at weddings, when there were no casualties, and the massacre of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted Press killing seven people.
Police want to ban the wearing of travmatiki in public places and raising the age at which one can get a license for weapons - from 18 years to 21 years.
Idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption Irina Spring and promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will bring to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by "tightening the screws".
The network has an open letter, which the authors - representatives of various social organizations rifle - need to abandon the "senseless tightening."
Percentage of bullying with a registered weapon is minimal, said the Russian service Bi -bi -si - criminalist lawyer Vasily Foresters.
According to statistics from the Ministry for the six months of 2012, 142 crimes committed with a firearm registered in the police, while the total for the same period recorded 1,168,000 crimes.
The authors of the open letter are sure that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not put the offender to go to the "black" market.
Now, they say, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claimed that the situation under control with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
"Black" arms market is replenished through several channels.
These five main channels, says retired Colonel Victor Baranez ten years worked within the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site, receiving orders for weapons
The first - "an army or military footprint," that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapon was dragged and Russian officers and Caucasians themselves," - says Baranez.
The next kind of "black gun" - stolen by criminals in the security forces.
Baranez explains that this includes police and carried away from the stores, and directly stolen from law enforcement officers.
Illegal "trunks" go on sale from military warehouses.
Many military warehouses often had a blast.
"There is a proven version of that part of the arson attacks were made specifically - to conceal the shortage," - says a former military man.
The mite, according Baranets, bring arms producers.
"Now multiply private armories that are no longer competitive in the international market and throw the gun under the counter on the black market, including Moscow," - said the expert.
Another source of "black" market - contraband.
Especially a lot of pistols and submachine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is the manufacture, sometimes craft, and formed a mob, which organized the flow," - says a former military man.
Location weapons?
The experts considered what is the approximate percentage of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons in the "black" market.
Report on this in 2011, prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and the Governance.
Experts analyzed the statements of the Interior Ministry and the Federal State Statistics Service, criminological literature and open data portals weapon subjects.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers wrote, comes from the army and security forces.
Half of all weapons on the black market was there "because of the officials whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases occur during the production of theft of weapons, 5% is "black archeology".
Shop assistant of one of the gun shops, who asked not to say his name, says that the weapons found black diggers, has long no one is buying - too old.
More often than not, as he says, with the new party sellers are going to a military warehouse.
After Ensign person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
He prescribed it, pass over the fence.
"He carries her to the city and is selling at 900 euros per share with two stores," - he says
"However, the police are aware of all cases, so sometimes when lit plan for solving crimes, conducting test purchases from merchants illegal weapons" - adds a consultant.
"As a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer often find each other through a friend.
I looked at the websites, blogs, yet has not responded fellow who offered to come to the platform, "Running", which will be the man who will take away my "corner" where we'll haggle.
Price of the barrel I only found out there
military commentator Viktor Baranez
To get the barrel I need a friend who has a way out, - says the shop assistant. - I have a friend there, but I do not believe in it.
The vendors on the market there, but there also needs to come conditionally "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell my daughter that the tooth fell out."
I'll even take out a pair of brass knuckles across a man in whom certain.
It also delivers them only to me, because he knows that I'm not looking for it.
Newcomers looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranez dabbled as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when preparing to publish an article about it.
Scheme, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album, where there was "anything."
"I felt like a luxury store," - says the military.
To the buyer, according to Baranets not offer a pig in a poke - all you can try.
I am a potential customer, not just buy - we 're going into the woods with the seller, there is a target set.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I make sure that the weapon has a good start to bargain," - describes the procedure for the expert.
Shop on the couch
Web search engines lead out to the sites and groups in "Vkontakte", which offers to buy weapons "for different purposes."
You do not need any documents and personal meetings.
"Just having a certain amount of money," - written in the hat online advertising "Buy combat pistol or machine."
It people leave their application and ask questions.
A minor sell?
"Without a license, of course," - asks the user "John" (spelling preserved).
"For TT.Moskva" - succinctly expresses the query "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service is now a huge network of shell scatter sites and looking to purchase military weapons rowing shovel.
People go, like a hungry fish to the bait, and then coal is mined in Siberia
military analyst and former military Victor Baranez
I have heard of such schemes : 's usually registered beyond Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer shall pay a cash machine.
"In response, send a photo and instructions, where weapons were hidden," - says the press- secretary of the organization "Right to Arms" Dmitry sour.
Victor Baranez claims that a request at the website, you can go without arms and going to jail.
The Federal Security Service is now a huge network of shell scatter sites and looking to purchase military weapons rowing shovel.
"People go, like a hungry fish to the bait, and then coal is mined in Siberia," - he said.
Makarov for$ 100
When buying illegal firearms, according to experts, can get away with$ 100 to$ 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to weapons," Makarov pistol can be purchased for$ 100-300.
Have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from the warehouses of the management of these long-term storage depots middle managers.
According to the official stastistike departments, compared to January - October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole declined by 7% to 22,900 and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices dropped 7 8%.

In the U.S., workers are on strike fast food and supermarkets
Through working at the cash register, "McDonald's" is held up to a quarter of all American teens
In recent days, in America, a wave of protests against low wages in the corporate department stores Walmart and restaurants popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendys" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
While no one can predict whether this will turn into a wave in the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out in the early stages.
Shares support trade unions and a number of left -governmental organizations.
In addition to increasing the modest salaries who receive ordinary workers of Walmart and fast food to the organizers of the protests is to create them in the trade unions.
While this sector is almost covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Stocks began last week after Thanksgiving, in the so -called "Black Friday" when America has fallen orgy giveaways, seized millions of ordinary people, and sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On this day, some workers corporation Walmart, which employs around the world 2.2 million people have left their jobs and picketed together with the trade unions and left-wing activists Stores Corporation, whose product is targeted at people modest and moderate means.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and automotive batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores an average of 8% to 27% cheaper than the large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid workers only Walmart outfit at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods podeshevke partly because few pays its employees.
The latter are also complaining about the poor working conditions, such as the lack of lift trucks or hand-held scanners.
The protesters in the "Black Friday" required to raise the salary and lamented the fact that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation, has jumped from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The typical worker Walmart, receiving 9.5 per hour, this cost is too expensive, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley, argue that if Walmart srednuyuyu salary increase to$ 12 per hour, it would cost corporations$ 3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries now.
If Walmart completely shift the wage increase on the shoulders of buyers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
For the year, they will spend some of 12.39 dollars more than they are now.
Supporters of Walmart rather point out that the protests have taken place only in nine states and did not cause any corporation maleyschego damage.
"Black Friday" continued its stores from 8:00 pm Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time, Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made in the "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
Corporation representative Dan Fogelman argued in an interview with the left site Huffington Post, that jobs have left a total of "at least five" employees of Walmart, and that the protest was merely "another public relations gimmick" has organized its union.
"Free Cash!"
Protests continued this week in New York, where they were not subject to department stores Walmart (them in this progressive city do not favor, and why they are so far), and "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it is selling billions of servings, and then it does not even give you a hospital and does not pay you for your honest work!
Dzhumeyn Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to the federal and New York law, is 7.25 dollars an hour.
Fast-food restaurants over time it increases, but not by much, and the average of their rank and file workers receive in New York 8.90 dollars an hour.
Fewer them in this expensive city does not earn one.
How can you be in New York for the money, to me incomprehensible.
Once through the "McDonald's" was held almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked part time for their stalls after school while living with his parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of food, or planning to stay there for long.
Now I constantly come across an interview with the workers "McDonald's", who complain that they must live on this salary, and sometimes even to feed her children.
On the other hand, in our Wall Street Journal's hanging a comment, the author notes that it is irresponsible to have children, if you do not know what you feed them.
The participants of the protests, which began at 6.30 am on Thursday at the "McDonald's" on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and cooks fast-food began to pay at least$ 15 per hour, that is, more than doubled their the current minimum wage.
They also demanded that in the field of fast food have been set up trade union organizations.
U.S. law prohibits the administration of this discourage and punish activists union movement chicanery and layoffs.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes them life.
But unionization fast food is difficult and for objective reasons.
One of the most important - an extraordinary turnover.
dissenters
Noisy protests took place on that day and a number of other cheap restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the campaign was in the middle of the day rally at the "McDonald's" near Times Square, with performances by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the City Council Dzhumeyn Williams, who said : "McDonald's," says he sells billions of servings, and then he does not even give you a hospital and does not pay you for your honest work ".
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a candidate for mayor, Bill de Blasio, who said that "we must join together in support of the fast-food workers, so that they have achieved pay equity, and economic prosperity, which deserves every New Yorker".
Described the incident as a New York Times, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the U.S. sphere of fast food.
But it involved only a few hundred people, though not all of them were employees of fast food service, which in New York employ tens of thousands of people.
It is unclear whether this will generate a spark of the flame of a mass movement.

"As long as the brain receives an average deceive"
Popular among fans of modern technology theme augmented reality recently accepted to perceive primarily through the prism of special glasses.
First summer at its annual conference, a working model showed Google, and then in November, it was reported that an application for a patent filed and the appropriate Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of a group of interactive 3D- technology in the Cambridge lab Microsoft Shahram Izadi that for scientists the company points - passed stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with his bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Tell us, please, in general terms, what your research group?
- We are engaged in human-computer interaction, but at the same time trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While stuck in the mass of humanity on the stage of the pixels on a flat screen, sometimes finger -pointing at them.
We want to look at 5-10 years ahead and to anticipate major changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and sensors Kinect - this is a step forward, and almost no one today without the Xbox Kinect is not for sale, because we all wonder gesture control.
- What else lies ahead?
- Despite the fact that interactions Kinect transferred to the physical layer, much still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Entering information improved (the system gets more data) and the output is not very much.
We are trying to change that, working on a true three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projective.
Be released into our computer world, physical, make it more tangible.
For this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around it.
Then we can add real world of virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And in the first place - to hell with those stupid helmets virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
Hot stuff, but do not overestimate it be?
- It certainly can not be considered a panacea - there is a question of privacy, because I do not always want to inform others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all forms of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we were thinking about gestures, but not over the sweeping, but at such meager, short.
At the same gestures taken not camera device and a wrist bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
As long as it's big, but theoretically it is possible to reduce the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is a mixed type of control, such as a gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say, and at the same time show.
- I usually just saying.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what can or can not at this time machine?
- It is not necessary, but it is a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we basically have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will define more accurately the human response.
This may be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
- If you talk about your work with sensors Xbox Kinect, which you claim to modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation - is something from which you can make a start in our work over the three-dimensional scanner.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f / s.
But the point is not in the megapixels, but as a template and depth.
On the latter point of view all of the current technology is not good enough for us - it's more work for designers of algorithms.
That is, we must remember not only about the resolution in the X and Y, but also Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and the current 30 f / s frankly not enough, especially for the gesture.
Steven Betishes Redmondskoy from our laboratory did touch sensor with adjustable delay processing - from 1 to 100 ms, the current serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how it affects the interaction between man and machine.
I would be in my line of work is very handy equivalent of such a device, not requiring touches to FPS was more.
- A number of cameras increase is not necessary?
- In the Kinect now has three "camera", one of which is actually - infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of the reflected signal.
And here is the third camera - this is actually a common sensor in the visible range.
It does not apply to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or exacerbate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play around with the location of the curvature of the camera and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, is not presented to the public its points.
Do not you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality glasses - this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the while walking around, holding a smart phone in his raised hands, not very comfortable, but that's what I think : the coolest option would be "passing" augmented reality, when based on cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, Head-Up Display and then everywhere.
Points - a very personal device, this is their strength (private things only visible to you), and weakness at the same time - based on augmented reality glasses will not allow you to work on the virtual objects shared with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only Tony Stark in "Iron Man," but a mere mortal.
There is one issue that is often pointed criticism of this idea : no tactile review!
Hands feel nothing!
What are the answers to your group is preparing for the challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality - this is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think it could well be the eighth addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks - the use of the second hand as a unique substrate for the image.
She is an excellent record pressing!
But there are technologies that are really aimed at making it here "pictures in the air," tangibility - for example, the interference of multiple ultrasonic beams directed at a specific point where the finger, gives a sense, but so far it is very weak - as if you blew on the pads.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerves in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Are you trying to fool the brain?
Make him think that he feels that must feel like at that moment, when he sees something?
- That 's a good idea, we have not tried to do so.
Here lies another problem, on which have to fight for a long time - how to make a person physically located in a very confined space, to believe that he is on the open, almost endless - and are working on the concepts of cross-country tracks (not like in the clubs), moving platforms, and huge balls.
While deceive the brain receives an average, much work remains for many years.
That's what makes working on a virtual reality so attractive for researchers - many things in a totally rudimentary.

Vkusovschina instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated citizens who are ahead in the forefront of art and culture.
At the top list of figures already got bright art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements extend beyond the city, often finding acceptance in Europe, bypassing wide fame.
New hero "Rosbalta" - flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man dressed all in red, which is found then the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then on the opening days and trendy hangouts.
Picture of Cyril Miller always attract crowds wherever they were not exposed.
Cyril Miller - one of St. Petersburg purely social and philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - a bright man Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80 's - early 90's.
In addition, he is a man of the city, its appearance on the streets calling smile from citizens, lifting the entire mood.
He recently have taken up the barrel organ and organ-grinder was St. Petersburg, as ripe for this challenging role of all its bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, and why are you still walking around the city in all red instead of yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red as a fashion designer, dealing views and image.
In this world of red color - it's a compromise between the artist, image maker and society.
Although in a society that is not just a little gray, causes aggression and agitation unkind properties.
But my provocations aimed at making conversation started.
The whole history of my provocative actions - an invitation to debate.
- And when did you realize you have to be an artist?
- The exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where they were exhibited my work.
I realized that this was my path.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists spent, the new, free like me were not clear.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with postgazonevschinoy that led to the "Pushkin -10" and larger waves were not.
Throws me to the theater, clothing, music, of all genres, except for the word.
- And it all came together in your art- clinic... - It was important to find yourself in the culture center of St. Petersburg, where the need to gather all the best creative force.
In 1995, I took the territory of the Pushkin -10, and there has not been repair, there was musical entertainment club, Bohemian Club, home of the St. Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born there : Bromeliad, Tequila jazz, remember Schnur led to the project, "Van Gogh's Ear."
Cord and his friends sang songs under the plywood lungs, they were in tight leotards, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band started playing live, it has become the "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg has been leading many programs to hali - galivskih times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and went to his great career, and basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137" club " Griboyedov - it echoes from the Art Clinic.
There our employees and patrons were gone.
I'm the hero of yesterday's age when the culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the prize was "The people of our city."
In the "Artist of the Year" was named I ended my climax.
In the new times under the old rules uncomfortable to work, I'm a man of truth, honesty, and culture of the past century.
In our years of easy to become popular, but the culture and the popularity of shared, can be popular, but not very cultured.
- Your work is inherent in a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings - it hits, they clearly expressed the urgency and severity.
I will have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in the Clowns."
Clowns - timeless category.
I used the social one, but now to be so - it's painful and scary.
But clowns smeared all, the tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I have a grotesque idea.
For example, save the world by changing the totalitarian by fiat.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on the mechanics of external rather than internal man.
Or maybe he can not apply his hand and spit in his face should be.
And cheating will be removed by changing clothes.
- And recently, we saw you in the role of urban organ grinder. - Cultural city should have such a hero.
Who else but me to be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be neat, considerate, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
Earlier, people get in packs, bohemians loved one, simpletons more.
Now everything is split into microcommunity, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note to please everyone.
Now we need to think who will like it.
Now everyone has a cult hero of 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes a few thousand!
- It accounts for broshenki there sex - social sector work.
And on cultural grounds 300 people come, and 10 million will not come, and end up with less management, money, everything withers.
I have fans, the main thing - they do not cheat, do not mess up their belongings.
I wrote in my youth such pictures that are a collector on the wall next to Falk and Larionov were hung.
I started with the paintings, which usually ends.
Now often confuse the terms.
They say, spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, is another story.
I am a man of culture yesterday, rose examples of artists who have lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused the money for the sake of drawing pictures.
I am here for such a culture.
- Cyril, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing : an official from the culture.
But not all of them can be engaged in culture.
With the right kings were not so, the kings, maybe not very understanding in culture, but they understand that you need to keep the right experts.
Here in Moscow now good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg, which might be experts, but they are pushed as needed higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and will give way to them.
Now thriving vkusovschinka.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all contemporary art we make, there are artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is right for you - St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg - is not a cultural capital of culture in Moscow is much more soil there is.
And on the rocks of our art is difficult to grow.
We need a cultural soil, and we have now more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe a lot of people curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We did this layer is thin.
We need to make a fashionable art, as it was in the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with the grant of St. Petersburg

Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming, or a collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans spacecraft with earthlings on board to go and find a spare planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises as to continue his race in zero gravity or on the same spare the planet?
I think the choice is limited.
In fact, only two of these planets, which can absorb at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars" - says a senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute of the PK Sternberg (SAI) Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars more habitable, on the surface of Venus - a temperature of 500 degrees.
You can live only at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Address the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, have conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the elimination of insects in orbit, the tiny fruit flies, fruit flies.
In 1979 he was sent into space quail eggs, to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get the output is normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem with the fact that this chick has to find its feet, it should stand on their feet and start moving," - says the head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Russian Academy of Sciences Vladimir Sychev.
Finding no support, the chicks randomly tumbling.
And after 10 hours in neonates there is a complete atrophy of the instincts.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
And there's trouble was that after four days they just died.
"And the two times we hatch chicks, then abandoned, because there simply is not possible to work with them," - says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space, Vladimir Sychev.
With animals the last time a biological "minikovcheg" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013 the research continues.
However biosatellite "Bion" will only same-sex individuals.
Was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with the fetus.
In principle, there have not found anything supernatural.
"It's just been on bio-satellites, but again - it is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out," - said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the cosmic offspring of rats appeared.
But to approach the problem directly in the space of reproduction has not yet obtained.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing, familiar surroundings, simply can not realize their sexual instinct.
The man, in contrast to the little animals, in principle, it can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and are able to create a fitting emotional backdrop.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But the woman in space fly for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing a human - is the female body.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say : does it after a flight into space.
Will she give birth to a child after the flight.
"After all, the question no one answered," - says the veteran space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father Andrian Nikolayev was also an astronaut.
In 1988 the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, two visits to the orbit, and even work in an open space, a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have a few units there are astronauts who, after long flights all cost, and growing a healthy generation.
"And if more, it is dangerous even at orbital flights" - sums up the pilot- cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratory CPC - a mandatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here in zero buoyancy skills astronauts work out in the open space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If an adult water, albeit comfortable, but still hostile environment, for infants - native element.
Small Ihtiandra seem to confirm - life on dry land out of the ocean.
There is a connection between what the baby is about 9 months in my mother's okoplodnoy fluid, then it is easier to get used to some water.
In principle, it is logical because from birth, from the moment of the first bath, passes only 2 weeks.
"It is not enough to forget something," - says Marina swimming instructor grudnichkovye Aksenov.
In short, if the unborn child more natural state of weightlessness, for women - need gravity, the force of gravity.
Very quick in weightlessness dryahleyut abdominal muscles, pelvis, falls ability to expulsion of the fetus.
Well, we drop it and relying on stimulants labor.
You can, of course, in a special chamber to go to give birth, she will push him.
"And then what?" - Specifies the non-trivial questions Valeri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also need artificial gravity.
Not feeling the gravity, the body will form the skeleton and muscular system.
Newborn in orbit is not possible, as an adult, to put in a special pull-up suit for training.
It will just be deprived of what it will be vital.
"And this experiment that we 'll go with you, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to what we bring to Earth a disabled person, completely perplexed man" - predicts the head of the committee on bioethics IBMP RAS Igor Pestov.
While the birth of children in space - a question of theory.
However, after a while it will be a reality when the humans on their ships will go to a distant planet, which will be home to their descendants born in space.

Head of the Main Control and Revision Office : Checking Schwarz - system failure caused by politicians.
In the field of public procurement Czech Republic has good control authorities, and despite the availability of high-quality legislation is lagging behind in its application.
This statement Miroslav Kala, Vice -President of the Supreme Audit Office, in an interview for the site Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have," - commented on the current situation of Kala.
Similar findings provide joint inspection of the Czech and German regulatory authorities.
As an example of improper practices lead Petr Necas approach to the so -called Schwarzschild system.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) will not bother business checks - it is banned or allowed?
"Law should be established by any means, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister can not resist the work of the institutions that are charged with the duty to inspect and ensure fulfillment of the obligations", - says Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee of the Chamber of Deputies did you talk about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, under which it is associated public procurement legislation of both countries.
What exactly was it?
This refers to the parallel testing, we started probably two years ago.
Simply put, the question of what the European legislation states how public procurement should take place, followed by the national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All information has been gathered and, even more unfinished check, showed interesting differences - in other words, the legislation we may be "highly accurate", but in practice we use in some respects inferior to Germany.
It follows that it is insufficient to create increasingly sophisticated rules need to focus on the application of the law itself.
And actually how the project can help you he means to you?
Such joint control can contribute to the efforts to stop clarify the laws, reduce and improve the limitations because it does not lead to positive results.
Economy means that the related things for a reasonable (but not necessarily low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the limit orders.
Perhaps this system will overflow "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in the system, will find them much more easily than if the limit is not reduced.
You talk about the internal problems of practical application of the law on public procurement.
And as a system of control in Germany?
Whether there exists such an organization as our KRU (Audit Bureau), or does it work differently?
For institutions, there as our KRA stands Bundesrechnungshof, hosted by our principle, there is also a board that works a little differently, but in general the two institutions operate similarly.
In addition, the powers to a certain extent similar to, but because Germany has a federal structure, there is a division of audit and at the level of the federal states - that their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH could only manage federal money, we have the public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the federal Court of Auditors.
With regard to local laws, there are simpler than ours?
Actually, I would not want to compare without concrete data, but in some ways Germany could be taken as a model, but you can definitely say that it is better at everything.
This is so because they are better able to cope with the control?
Definitely not, but again, I do not like such comparisons.
But I must say that even exemplary countries face many challenges.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefits from the cooperation with our office, right?
Speaking of domestic legislation, the impact on both your facility amendments to the Law on Public Procurement, somehow manifest the consequences?
Given that the validity of these amendments is rather short, it has not manifested itself in our works to control.
Since we do in fact control, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
Take it into account only in the preparation of future inspections - we started using our new tool "detection risk uneconomical" through which we drove nearly 14,000 government contracts. We have analyzed them. There is, of course, these changes will occur, because the restrictions are changed, changed the terms of certain types of tenders and so on.
Do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or an additional load on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope this is confirmed.
A problem that may arise is that the rules "tougher" and can not be observed.
In operation, the previous rules controlled entities are tied with the supplier (for example, the regional operational programs - with the regional council) that any failure to comply with the public procurement law is a violation of fiscal discipline.
Whether it is necessary in this case to tighten the law in such a way?
I do not think this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but do not punish those who commit a formal error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system would only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let us realize that this path does not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GFC will not bother business checks so-called Schwarzschild system. What does this mean?
" Schwarz- system ' liens or enabled?
The law should be installed in any way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister can not resist the work of the organs, which is charged with the duty to inspect and to enforce obligations.
You can say, "We will change the law and solve it," but we can not say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Law on Public Procurement has pretty strict rules, as well as what should be formal, and rightly so. This will protect the public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have.

Shimon Ornest : In concert, we want to gain positive energy
What do you think about the fact that less than a month has come to an end?
It's only just one of the many disturbing stories that we humans are so easy to get caught.
Together with a group of The Tap Tap we constantly joke about it and say that we - the only group in the world to be able to gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell more about it readers?
We are talking about a national fundraising event that we are planning for the past two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar, the end of which is announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before the event, on December 20 at 21:00 in parallel start three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, time zone, which is 12 hours earlier than us, will end May calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally, it was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonzo Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to build up enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want together with the public to reflect on the condition of the world we pass on to our children one day.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original Klyuchiki against the end of the world. These things can be bought on site www.e-tap.cz and thus at the same time to support us.
The Tap Tap Group together with other musicians also performed the national anthem against the end of the world, which is called "End of the World is canceled."
Will sound if the audience is already a favorite YouTube anthem at this benefit concert?
Of course, in the end, if in the end everything will turn out the light and the end will not come.
His sing all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
Hymns will be heard at the same time as live Czech TV.
The words to that song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomas Hanák, also participates in the performance Xindl X...
How did you start to work with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life, as we spend a lot of charity events and concerts.
Actively trying to connect them to the projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
At that proceeds from the concert will go against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for barrier-free education center STUDEO, now in its sixth year, so we are working with the civil union Tap the Institute Edlichki.
Teachers regularly visit schools students Edlichki institute and carry with them fun and interesting activities.
Do the students can not afford to go to the teachers, and so we try to give them this opportunity.
The project is the construction of an additional institution Edlichki in the future there will separate the building in which we move with this project.
At each concert will feature several musical groups and artists.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to make a program that will interest all generations, including children.
Например, в Праге выступят Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere с Даном Барта, The Tap Tap, Марьян Банго и Иржи Сухи.
All details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such "grand event" in the future?
In May, we will for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and then, of course, prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we 'd love to spent representation in the Czech national home in New York, and I personally, so if we are in the United States, would very much like to speak in Washington, DC and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
Group The Tap Tap - a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the way in terms of organization and logistics?
It's not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on electric wheelchairs, strollers they have to travel in the baggage compartment, plus the entire large amount of cargo and boxes of tools.
Nevertheless, while coping with it without problems. ČSA Czech Airlines and British Airways British Airways has always been excellent for us prepared, that I wondered how many times.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything went without any problems.
Due to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards persons with disabilities and so on.
With what you've come across so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything is functioning better than us, in Russia, we have seen that in the east is still at a basic level.
Compared with Prague in Moscow, a lot of barriers, and there is still a novelty independent movement of people on the electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there is not a course of such trivial things as to give way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already having social organizations that are trying to draw people's attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are so many things, the level of performance that far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and the improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal that people with severe disabilities to move independently in the streets may go to the bathroom in the museum, but where you want...
There's not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in which we do with The Tap Tap a little ahead!
Respect for the public or Accessibility - is one thing, but at a time when we will be among the famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, when it all really starts to change.
While these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but will return two years ago, which in 1998 made you organize it?
I went to college Edlichki as an educator, I was around a lot of young people who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician and I play including the saxophone, then together with a colleague organized a fun musical circle.
Well, over time, says our lead Ladya Angelovič, it's a little out of hand (laughs).
Popularity also came only in the last few years, or am I confusing you?
It's true, it helped that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can appreciate, in fact does not seem to exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can not afford qualified teachers, equipment, and so on.
If you stood in front of the goal as well unleash The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt their potential ability to do something extraordinary.
In show business is full of things, imitating one another.
This is logical, everything new is taken with care, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, sorry, it's natural...
But the pity is absolutely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering from some and abandoned by all individuals, we need to spare.
They are the people who can live a full life and grow, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities get something, it is a shift not only for them but for the whole society.
Has the success that you are a strict leader, how many of you think?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and keep some discipline.
But I think it's fine.
Some people come to us with a romantic view and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that two times a week they have to go to rehearsal, attend training courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it happens in any group that wants to work hard and achieve something.
Currently, the group The Tap Tap twenty people.
How many were there at the start in 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovič.
We are an open group of people come and go, it can not be prevented.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the stadium Incheba, in Brno - the club Fléda and Ostrava - Plynojem in the center with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected Telemachus at the time of a song of The Tap Tap "End of the World is canceled."
The purpose of this project - to collect funds in the amount of 25 million euros for the purchase of multi -barrier equipment for an educational center at the Institute STUDEO Edlichki in Prague.
Concert ticket costs 400 euros for children under 12 years free admission. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.

Poland and space.
Last week at a meeting of the European Space Agency, Poland adopted the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country of the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA 12 September 2008).
Poland began to work closely with the ESA in 1994, and in subsequent years has actively participated in several projects of the agency.
But the road to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts involved flights into space, but this is not always met with understanding.
I recall, for example, a lecture by Sternfeld, which is December 6, 1933 presented in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas of his groundbreaking work, "Introduction to the space program."
Ideas of a young engineer (b. 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years of Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Ian Gadomskii was interested in his work.
In 1934, France won the Sternfeld, Robert Esnault- Pelterie and Andre Luis Hirsch for "Introduction to the space program."
Dr. Ian Gadomskii (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, and later became a great promoter of astronomy and space exploration.
He has published in Polish magazines hundreds of articles and has written a number of books devoted to these disciplines.
Gadomskii became known global advocate of space, and his contribution has been assessed, including the fact that one of the craters on the Moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built railway trolley, equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remains unknown, as well as details of the project.
Not even clear for acceleration or deceleration for the trolley was to be used rocket.
Information about this trolley is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about the missile booms.
The study carried out by the Section of weapons technology collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Volfke and Gustav Mokzhitskim.
Of the remaining material can be seen that the study reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops was interrupted.
In 1937, specialized in printing the idea of photovoltaic missile destroyer, which was proposed by the engineer Rohozynsky, and the following year came the work "air missile and torpedo aircraft missile - bomb" 's Leliv - Kzhivoblotskogo.
Both projects were developed for military use rocket engines.
Before the war, all the projects of the military use of rocket technology involved Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), who coordinated all the work.
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of operation, the work ended because of the war.
Next scientific papers on aerospace, appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
First of society mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal "Problems", which publishes four voluminous article in Astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich offered to organize a society that is engaged in space activities.
While projects are gaining momentum satellites, and it was clear that the space research - a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PHA) was trying to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and the fall of the POA has been a full member.
And next year, the first chairman of the POA Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959) became the deputy chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
In this position he remained until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, PHA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile, which carried out the research.
The first type RM- 1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
Missile capable to cover the distance of 1800 m, was a length of about 80 cm, and it weighs less than 5 kg.
It was subsequently built an upgraded version of RM- 1A, and the summer of 1959 on a vacant lot Bledovskom tests were carried out two-stage RM- 2.
The missile has a length of about 1.4 m, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the missile has already been able to engage in real scientific work - RM- 34 rocket could not overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude winds.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
Heir of the first missiles began RM -1 Rocket Meteor, developed in the period between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-step, its total length is 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Have developed three types (designated as Meteor- 1A - 1B and - 1C), which differ in size cameras for scientific equipment.
Meteor rocket - 1A possessed a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor- 1B - 0.34 L and Meteor- 1C - 0.62 l.
The maximum range for all three types was 37 km.
In the period between 1965 and 1968 was held at the Aviation Institute of Development Meteor -2 missile, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor -2 missile with a launch weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built version of the Meteor -2H and Meteor -3.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, the program Intercosmos, Poland participated in the exploration of outer space on the Soviet Satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky interkosmonavtom was second after Vladimir Remek.

Repeal of the law on public works - this is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on public works.
Ruling led to a lively debate in the community.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this from the perspective of a broader point of view.
Liberal- oriented economic system in the EU, as well as in a globalized world, based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that some economic units national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unfettered movement of private capital with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result, a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages) there is price pressure.
Under this concept you need to understand the state when the manufacturer by delivering cheap goods tries to survive in the economic competition that "knocks down" the cost of competitor to pick up a larger share of the market and, thus, to increase their own income.
In a large scale it is for most entrepreneurs or moving production abroad or cheap purchases abroad or disappearance. The result is increased unemployment in those countries where labor costs in comparison with other high.
As the private equity does not assume any social responsibility, including produced them for unemployment, the inevitable increase government spending on social needs.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of Businesses pay taxes and thereby offset the public economic and social damage caused by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
Cavalier methods of private capital to create the level of individual economies situation where governments are forced to compete with each other to artificially reduce the social standards of their peoples in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments give to their own population to private capital, despite the social decay.
This is reflected primarily in changes in the law.
The goal is to get his people economically obey the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
It operates as a system of economic coercion in the case of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool for cutting workers' rights in the field of labor law.
As a result of increased levels of poverty, and at the same time and the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, a few years there is a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to support themselves by their own labor.
The number of these people have already approaching one million.
In order to improve the competitiveness of the German economy cases are constant when, employed people get a salary that the state should pay extra to them that they get a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public in the case of additional workers Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU, of course, lead to the same state in which people who are under pressure from a catastrophic collapse of the social status, or forced to emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or exist on starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that one day the country will private investment capital.
However, one wonders how he will be taken?
If the funds are to come from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to the other, or he will not come at all, as the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, African is still working for the European share of wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media ad nauseam argue that the state can not participate in the capital of its own economy, which managed economy leads to economic disaster.
Private equity insists on the fact that the state should not interfere in the actions of the managers of the economy.
Followed by the answer to the question does not apply to private capital, is now virtually controlling politics and that 's the whole state, for their own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer - yes.
The proof is the existence of a nearly omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
As a result we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, ensuring the mutual benefits of the law, where almost all deserved to be punished, but not a crime.
In Germany the situation is that government ministries because of a lack of funds entrusted draft legislation to private law firms that are closely linked to industry.
Then Bundestag approves the bills.
All power comes not from the people, as the Constitution of the Western type, and from the powerful financial groups, who prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that the liberal- oriented democracy now quickly finds himself in a situation such as that described in the product Appiani "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey": " The state has long been dissolved, and agencies engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal obtaining favors with stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any restrictions, and people went to the polls to vote in advance sold ""... good people do not run for the post of governor in the end once the state for eight months left without consul"...."began in earnest say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need to choose an energetic man".. Appian thought it would be Pompeii, but he was Caesar, who eventually replaced by democracy autocracy.
As in ancient times, in modern society is dominated by the interests of their own reckless, excluding the public interest.
Private capital is inherently not intended to be used for public purposes.
The current result is not different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to reform the deeper nature.
So the cause of the fascist and communist regimes, we should look for in a reckless liberalization of the economies of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the lack of these regimes and the existence of a liberal type of democracy can be seen as a pause, after which the expected next round.
First of all it is tragic that the current elite ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, human and social catastrophes that we are now seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new stories.
Repeal of the law on public works is not the solution, or at least not permanently.
Under the pressure of competition, both at the international and at the national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to find ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the equity participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society to the state.

Israel : Laboratory of chaos.
"Out of the violence will not work, and can never get out" - Sting song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain are the words : "Do not forget what we are fragile."
"If my sons did not want wars, they would not be" - a dying Gutel Shnaper, Meyer Amschel Rothschild's wife.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has caused a lot of feedback.
Some advocate for Israel, explaining its position that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the Israeli state racism, genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is assigned the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate on who these recurrent waves of murders - the offender, the victim and who is, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territory, were born at the time of the current political situation, and did not witness the violence started.
My goal - is to offer readers a peek behind the curtain to look at who primarily serve as a continuing tension already 95 years (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small plot of land in the Middle East.
Some of my arguments are backed by historical facts, some of which are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind - is primarily a story of the struggle for power.
In each period, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - these people are always completely independently undertake their steps, or for their throne was someone who had directed their steps to the pre- established goals.
It is necessary to admit that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that the concentration of money and power arising out of them could not happen in a generation.
Among the astronomically rich family stands alone, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (do not know whether someone above them, but it is not excluded) - Rothschilds.
About a lot of them do not write.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) they have bought in the 90s of the 19th century to stop the rumors linking them with the name of the criminal acts in the higher spheres, in the shadow of where they are, and have always led to the strengthening of their power, or the augmentation of wealth at the same time and besides, and more.
They are large stakes in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries whose central banks, they do not have their share, and they are preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan was only 7 countries since the invasion of Iraq was the 5 countries after the overthrow of Gaddafi had only four, but at the same time, the Russian government took the central bank of the country in their hands.)
Anyone who has tried to resist this family, died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the central bank for the Rothschilds Bank of America, during the Civil War, he began to produce their own (you know - the government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began issuing their own money and wanted to cancel the FED (Federal Reserve System), was murdered in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the great economic crisis in 1929.
Their lust for world power during the period from 1859 to 1871 led to the development plan for three world wars created a great 33rd Freemason Albert Pike level.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchies in Europe, and the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially the United Kingdom, and the third to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (as many slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury and they will not consume a lot of resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can not be anything other than a pre-requisite for such a project), and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which the working group of the wealthiest families, headed by the Rothschilds, is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these solutions are false and will always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see bottom FED, which was to prevent a repeat of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Hapsburg heir to the Austro - Hungarian throne, Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolyutsiiyu.
The First World War ended in a sudden, unreasonable in military and economic terms, the surrender of Germany (there was no need for war to destroy Czarist Russia) and, as a consequence, there has been fragmentation of the Central European powers, Austria- Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers and politicians have created a latent conflict situation, put it on a huge war reparations Germany than paved the way for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then the Germans could only throw a strong enough convicting the guilty and offering simple solutions to the Leader, then a multinational Czechoslovakia with strong German minority, which was to play, and really played a function of the fifth column, for starting the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds have provoked the base of the Zionist movement, one branch of which was trying to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of historical Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (the return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine began to happen the first clashes with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks have occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler had escaped from the chains in which he was initially kept the bankers, or whatever he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the preconditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the international community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked war reparations to the 2nd World War, the state of Israel was proclaimed, to create a center of war -third.
If the international bankers will be able to untie it, the Jewish people, as well as in World War II, becomes a victim of the fighting on the front lines, this time together with the Arabic or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel - it's like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos, not only domestically but also internationally (just take a sharp division of the people into supporters and opponents of Israel.)
Who is to blame and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in the endless chain of violence, if it all started with the greed of individuals and their aspirations to world power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders because, like us, the international bankers shoved people to vote in the elections only their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's hawk is a typical example of the fascist loyal to the international bankers politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan,...) will be threatened develop into a world conflict, and given control over Iran's Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of the world's oil reserves (shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide) - also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what now appear the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 : "All we need - is a general crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The New World Order in their view - a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is a handful of the financial aristocracy, enjoying the comfort.
A world where everyone is born with the birth of the body implanted chip, with whom he becomes a creature, is under total control.
" And it makes all the big and small, rich and poor, free and slave to have on his right hand or on his forehead mark, so that a person who is not marked the name of the beast, or the number of his name, he could neither buy nor sell.
That's the wisdom: anyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
Because it corresponds to the name of men, and the number is - six hundred sixty-six.

The film "Operation" Argo " : When worse than ever, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the U.S. that have been the patron of his regime for decades.
For the U.S. administration a positive outcome of the situation suggests that - she could not afford to throw overboard the Shah, because it is at the root of the allies could undermine confidence in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution has led to the establishment of the theocratic regime, she was not able to.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
Prisoners diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Government of Algeria.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity at home and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Defeat in Iran has greatly contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the presidential election of 1980, which ended the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, srezhessirovanny actor Ben Affleck "Operation" Argo " describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the Embassy of the six workers managed to escape.
After they finished the complex twists and turns its way into the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities managed to take them out of Iran, with the help cover extravagant legend, according to which they traveled on a Canadian passport as members of the film crew was looking for a place in the country for the filming of the sci-fi epic.
The combination of genres
The plan, which invented the expert on "evacuation" Tony Mendez, demanded cooperation Hollywood.
To the legend was true, in specialized journals written about the film project, arranged a press conference, a fictional manufacturing company has had a real office.
Details of the operation for a long time kept secret, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck movie - a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, the real political thriller, the so-called "film - kinoopus" the story of a successful venture, fraud - an example would be a series of films about the Ocean.
In the film, constantly changing mood - on the one hand, the documented conceived scenes from Tehran (uncredited shows iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were shown in the movie - big differences to do so).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and mild exaggeration.
And then another scene from the headquarters of the CIA and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating table, on the stairs of institutions on the phone...
Ben Affleck remarkably managed to re-start a career.
From ridiculed the actor has become a respected director, and his game has ceased to be an object of ridicule.
"Operation" Argo "is his third feature film, after the dark detective" Gone Baby Gone "(2007) and the thriller" The City " (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film Affleck, who starred in the director 's hometown - Boston.
A sense of the atmosphere at this place belongs to the qualities that have raised their earlier films directed by Hollywood over the standard.
And it shows Affleck in "Argo", where Tehran is "playing" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of real events - the opening scene of the fall of the embassy is impressive with its clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability, which occur when somewhere suddenly changed history.
Similar effect Affleck and his colleagues reach the scenes of fictional (fake headquarters at the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic value.
It works quite well with this little, sometimes think up something - it all comes out not as elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America to prevent a looming crisis at the airport in Tehran, and the chase for the runway look pretty far-fetched.)
The disadvantage of "Argo" is a distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are in the movie are not the only ones.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, this is a movie that you can watch with mild interest, assessing the staging and retro style, recreates the thrillers of the seventies.
But captures the hard way.
However, this is enough to remind you of the one still in a sense of living history, as well as evidence of how exaggerated idea of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services.

Terms of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
Portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, annually conducting a survey on the most absurd of bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd decision or project from the workshop of the EU."
"We spodviglo to this last event, in which the EU is planning to take a 40 per cent quota for women in the administration of large European companies," - said the "rules" of the questionnaire organizer Patrick Nager.
Among the already nominated for the nomination absurdities - the recent decision of the European Court of association insurance rates for men and women.
Until now, women have the benefits of life insurance, because insurance companies to objectively they are less at risk.
"Further incredible ideas from the workshop of the EU can nominate people to the competition by the end of this year.
Needless voting will take place until the end of February 2013, "- said Nager.
By orders of the controversial EU is, for example, and the mandatory addition of bio-components in the fuel, resulting in harm nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances directive or about the size of chicken cages, as a result of this year rose significantly eggs.
Also criticized was subjected to a de facto ban on the use of the term "butter for sandwiches" or withdrawal from the market of classic light bulbs.
Quality bananas should be a length of 14 centimeters.
The pan-European unit often makes a decision under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are normally protected by a State or group of States (Czech Republic so now even threatened Council defends claims of its banks).
Lobby interests are: for example, high -quality bananas in the European Union were to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show "abnormal curvature".
In this case, the European Commission was justified by the fact that only harmonizes existing disparate national rules that complicate trade.
EU, despite the opposition of some states, yet softened the standards for fresh fruit and vegetables, referring to the fact that the existing directive would lead to a dissipation of products.
Candidate to win in a survey last year and could become the EU decision, under which sold balloons must be equipped with a warning that children under eight years can not inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU appealed to American studies, according to which the balloons in the game are a potential cause of child deaths by suffocation.
Such a restriction would now apply to children under 14 years old, who are forbidden to blow into the fairground dudelki.
Fun ideas are born at home
Enough is absurd and rule on European officials themselves : anyone who has any official position of the European Union, can not, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece to use the name Macedonia, and should instead say "FYROM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnípoplatky.com portal in collaboration with the association of liberal economists ' principle of non-interference "(Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to the above a few absurd rules, such as the EU rules on the amount of food stocks in the membership of the state.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks, which may be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the date of its entry into the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, set the volume of canned mushrooms, for which she was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire is also interested in the idea of paying for some countries, because they do not have the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies to the application for subsidy.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We are at a disadvantage because we do not have the sea.
The European Union will ask for compensation, "- said the fall of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (CSSD).
As an argument, he pointed out that there was a high grain yield, and as a result of the so -called intervention purchases of state had warehouses full of inventory that was necessary to take out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the port, the EU, according to Palacio, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission has met the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for subsidies offered villages Ministry of Regional Development, led by Minister Paul Nemets (US-DEU), in particular, the subsidy had to go on drawing up applications for subsidies from Brussels.
EU : Bizarre orders are the exception
Although the regulations in the Member States can easily become the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, as well as a more efficient operation and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve more recognition.
A major problem, according to experts, is the scoop EU subsidies for projects that do not have even a hint of anything to do with the deepening of European integration, however, that Member States have made in the discussion of the budget.
Evokes emotions of the Czechs and the fact that, as in other European Union countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to identify their specific traditional products, and it does not always win in this contest.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting, the Germans and the Austrians retained the name "Olomouc cheese," but "Tuzemsky rum", whose traditions in our country goes back to the 19th century, our producers have been renamed to "Tuzemak."
Rum may be called only from cane distillate products and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products the EU, along with world-famous cheese "feta" and "gorgonzola", marzipan from Lübeck German or parma ham, already proved, for example, Carlsbad crackers, and pogorzhelitsky Třeboň carp and hops.
Also trademark of the EU can be proud Pardubice gingerbread and gorzhitskie tube.

People want me to be protected the republic, but I'm a fan - says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, as a person comes to mind to run for president?
I do not think about getting to become a senator or president.
If we all operated in the country without any problems, then I would not run anywhere.
But I can not see how in the last 20 years, the country is stolen, as there are bustling thieves, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I do not like it, then try to find a solution how to change that.
And since I was forty years old and I am an independent person, not related to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things, but to run for senator or president.
In the Senate you have got, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Do not you turn around so his back to the people who you choose?
I kept saying that to join the struggle for the presidential castle depending on the result of the elections to the Senate.
Later, I said that if I selected a senator, I will run for president.
My goal is not the position, position - a tool by which I can make their views.
So I need the greatest impact and sweeping powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation murmur at the bar or at the TV, but are willing to trample on anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this are the media that denigrate human, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom lies.
For example, talking about me, that I give a bribe journalists, or that I was an adviser Jiri Paroubek.
Let us turn to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you started with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on the inverse property declarations to the amount of above twenty million.
To do this, you need to change the law.
You as the president such authority is not, and only the whole Senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I as a citizen lobbying is to conduct tours became free enterprise, it could promote.
The problem is politicking - when someone comes up with a good offer on the left or right, he intentionally obstruct, and this hinders citizens.
As an independent non-party man I have much more potential for support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no party unfolding on the shelves, without regard to the dogmas can take from each lot of what is best for our country, and to apply it.
Do you consider yourself a person is more related to the right or to the left?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that the people I relate more to the left.
For me it does not matter at all - a little bit to the left or to the right.
For me it is important that we go forward.
It is not about what someone refers to the right, and some to the left, I want to bring people together.
I always will support any good solution to society, whether it will offer MHRC or GFC, and I 'll just against bad ideas.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But do not you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a company, you also have some common goals and views.
And to that you are trying to approach.
You can call it populism, but all proposals of which I speak, are already in operation in the world, or talk about them eminent experts.
But without the support of Parliament you will only slogans.
And with that in politics you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you go out to the people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other option.
Only convincing politicians, journalists and the public, and try to lure them to his side, so that we succeeded.
If I were elected president, I would not have been a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I will refer to the chairpersons of the parliamentary parties with a call to legalize financial and criminal penalties for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of failure, will have to report, why do not.
If there is a strong personality who will voice abuse, then we can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of public pressure.
I say outright that I am a lover, not a genius, and not intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend their beliefs and attitudes.
I'm just a beginner in politics, and for the program will try to get the support of the majority.
Cause I 'm trying to promote yourself, in the event that it fails, six years later, finish and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds as if Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I do not no savior.
I know the one I will not do anything, so I walked around a number of famous people with the offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchur, he refused due to the heavy workload.
Well at least I supported the investigation leading journalist Ian Lorentsov, which revealed the fraud to light fuel oil.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel I am on the scale.
Sixty per cent of people did not go to the polls, and most of those who went to the representatives chosen establishment.
We are independent in the Senate only two.
People chose the Senate so that the changes will be made to work.
Despite this, I will fight for their views, for example, the direct election of mayors and governors.
You think about the basis of his own party?
That's what I still do not think because I do not have time to check the cleanliness of the past every potential supporter, and I do not have the money for it.
There is no money in the presidential campaign, on my clear account only twenty thousand crowns.
You have no money?
You're talking about property declarations, and how are your own thing with it?
Private property is valued at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million to 10 million apartment, one apartment for 8 million art collection of about 10 million, the Aston Martin 3.5 million and Skoda Superb in a million, there is still a few million on the account.
By the way Aston Martin I had, because it was my boy's dream - I've always liked James Bond, who was driving the car, was gallant with women and at the same time fighting against the treachery and lawlessness.
You 're driving on the Aston Martin, own property by 60 million and you have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but their own money to invest too much in it do not want.
It's not very convincing.
I do not have 15 million on the campaign.
I have to get into debt?
In the campaign I have already invested 2.5 million.
The fact that I do not have sponsors, suggests that my program is not as interesting.
And I do not have to pay for the campaign out of his own pocket.
The cost of the campaign I basically cover the senatorial salary.
But for the money I would not have lived, for example, could not pay his son for the English school, which costs 30 thousand per month.
If I only wanted to make money, so would not run anywhere.
So then you're going to do business, so that you can live?
Did not you say that reduce this activity?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, the activity I partially reduced.
For example, the managing director of a travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like that I was bessrebrenniki that will keep the Republic.
But I also need to make a living.
How, as an entrepreneur, you're used to receive monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, and I get on.
And if I were president, I would have finished my business.

MVRDV architects argue that real adventures are not only in the imagination - for example, Spijkenisse and its newly constructed Mountain Book - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it looks futuristic, finally, we can again see something interesting," - says Lisette Verhayg, people on the edge of the road.
And Stephen Spermon, IT specialist at a nearby large company, said this: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we need today is another library?
We all have the Internet, iPad and e-books.
Today, no one willingly goes into such an old-fashioned library, right?
Spijkenisse, maloprimechatelnomu couchette town near Rotterdam, belongs to an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance a few years ago it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes in the form of beautifully painted miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they remained the only way to overcome the statistics: build a library!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold bar charts and the author of witty, sometimes cynical buildings, took to the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury looked puzzled and shrugged their shoulders, daring Maas resigned from his original gift pyramid in size and finished a speech in defense of his project as follows: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my suggestion: "Book Mountain" in Spijkenisse, the so-called Bukenberg!
After nine years, the mountain value of 30 million euros has increased.
It is part of a revitalization project that includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the contest "Best Library of the Netherlands in 2012."
The project is also involved in a national competition Dutch wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, previously could not offer anything but post-modern pedestrian zone and surprisingly ugly town hall, white facades which suggest dairy, became richer by one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly - in Spijkenisse appeared first in the history of this small town public building cultural facilities.
The Long Road to book
First impression : book Eldorado under the hood for the cheese.
There is only one elevator that takes place in the center of the rock mass, because the real fans of architecture and prefer reading to explore this area on foot.
Sash on all sides the room - light and easily foreseeable, the floors of brick and elegant street lamps accurately create a sense of urban public space.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
Glance involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
"Usually, bookshelves line the facades, and in the middle is a large dark room, usually bleak and faceless" - says Winnie Maas.
We have put a classical configuration space on its head and pulled the zone read from the inside out.
The interior of the book skillfully used the mountains : in the center of the offices, online library, chess club, an environmental center and technical rooms.
Particularly pleasing black bookshelves, which are then finished walls, the parapets, the stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell unusual.
Even the most experienced architects and civil engineers are at a loss, what is this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," - explains Joop Trauborst, project manager representing the community Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once one agricultural enterprise in Friesland we met the right by-product of agriculture.
For many years in the fields and greenhouses in the Netherlands as a lining under the roots of the artificial fiber material millimeter thickness.
It's cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles used one season, then it can be thrown away.
For a library, the painting - for the first time in such volumes - was compressed to four centimeters thick panel.
Under the action of heat and pressure of the so-called landbauplastik (KLP) is transformed into a dark, uniform, durable material, a bit like the smell of a new car and a bit of running shoes.
At the top are 105 steps.
He who overcomes path length of almost 500 meters, will be rewarded in a literary cafe is not only a fantastic view of the city, but also the Dutch croquettes and wood potted ficus.
They care about the atmosphere in the first place about the proper humidity in the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but the building, despite the many glass surfaces is a model project in terms of ecology," - says Trouborst.
For its heating and cooling uses the heat of the earth.
Although Book mountain stands in a glass case, even on clear days, the sun falls within a short time.
Extensive farm of plywood, placed perpendicular to the glass facade, provide shade and take over much of the sun's rays.
Indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest of protection is provided by a fully automatic roller blinds.
Stephen Spermon referred to above skeptic of the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhayg was also present here.
And as a teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogard, who called Bukenberg "the soul of Spijkenisse, which has long lacked."
Reason: a few weeks before the opening of each resident received an invitation to donate a book from its collection.
These books were to occupy the empty space on the shelves is not yet fully staffed library - at that time it had 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The shelves are made to the top.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library," - says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, now everyone in some way connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the building.
Even if it is just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV was able to solve the royal task, which is called in the jargon of identity building.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And though they are very young and uneducated.
It's just the starting point for the construction of identity.

Sabu: "The Germans have to play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the U.S. and Europe, in so doing, Berlin diplomatic balancing on the narrow track.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany first made it clear that she would vote against the Palestinian bid for observer status at the United Nations.
But then the Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo : Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Who Germany needs to be cautious with regard to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that the American position, it also does not support.
Germany wanted to show his independence - while not speaking too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no -fly zone.
As a result, NATO held this proposal.
Germany's hard to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes, it is.
The fact that it is in the process of converting its foreign policy, namely the proceeds of the policy, which is to say, the United States managed to actually German foreign policy.
Additionally situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans have no agreed common policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
From them, it is expected that they will play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that as long as they only feel for the role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy which holds France or the UK.
What exactly is "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It is the willingness to take a position of its own national interests, which does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, the export and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are largely different from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must defend its interests.
Did these economic interests in the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has the largest markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab world.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I would not give it too much importance, it is not entirely one-sided communication.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of the Germans.
Germany harmed if its relations with the United States abstaining when making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States dominates the understanding of German positions.
So I do not think it was such a dramatic change of heart, as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will become even so some respect.
After all, it indicates that it should be taken seriously as a player on the international scene and that its interests should be considered.
In Europe, there are different opinions on the Palestinian initiative.
United States, by contrast, clearly supported the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the U.S. and many European countries?
Because of American domestic politics, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration is at heart a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation the government, of course, can not openly take such a position.
I believe that the essential difference of opinion is not so great as always is.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not enthusiastic about the politics Netanyahu.
Is it easy to combine their German ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner of the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be somewhat easier if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they can not act as part of a broader approach and instead are forced to act, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
That's what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a lead role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that, for Germany it is not easy, if only because of ties with Israel.
This topic has always been a hot potato.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player - if she would take over the lead role really?
Or leading role is still difficult given Germany?
Germany still has not got used to it, it still is always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, there is still always difficult given to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time when Germany takes on the important role that brings out the various anti-German feelings.
The Germans do not just deal with it.
Actually, this is an old problem : you do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this standpoint, Germany is much worse situation than the USA.
It must take into account the various neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
Thus, the influence of the U.S. in European politics permanently weakened, but at the moment the EU does not fill the void, then who is?
The Germans will just have to play a more significant role.
Even if you do not like, dislike or enhances unpleasant to you - that's life!

"Protection of Trademark" in China when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - the world-famous Brand, Ralph Lauren - TOZÉ.
No. What is Armani Polo?
This is a brand officially registered in the name of China, which has nothing to do with the companies of the names which it is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected as long as the owners of the original names do not sue.
But even then, it is unclear whether they can defend their rights.
"Foreigners are increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China," - says Thomas Pattloh, the lawyer of Taylor Wessing, specializing in violation of trademark rights in the Far East.
On my desk every week there is a new case of this kind.
The simulator is enough to add a couple of letters to be eligible to register their trademarks.
So it turns out Gucci Lu-Gucci, Prada, instead, you can register Prada-Kny.
The same way legally copied German companies, such as sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloh opens the folder with the records department of trademark registration in Beijing.
September 14, 2010 there is a Chinese company registered trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name, which used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese - the world champions of copying and infringement of intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities, there are multi-story department stores that sell almost exclusively forgery.
However, things are not as Pattloha. On behalf of their clients, he is opposed to Chinese enterprises quite officially received from the department trademark the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it the "ban minpay" mark - passenger.
The word is synonymous with "ban dakuan."
So called women who hunt for wealthy men.
Chinese authorities did not recognize their guilt
"It is detrimental to business, it is necessary to fight" - convinced Pattloh.
"The brand is eroded, a unique position is lost, the image suffers greatly."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected areas in the millions, especially in the case of expensive products being copied.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of EUR 15 billion a year is the third largest and fastest-growing market for luxury goods.
However, to achieve removal of questionable entries in the register of trade marks is difficult, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloh talks about the cases in which the court dismissed the claims, as after a long time has protested the name became "a reality of the market."
If the claimant is not lucky, he will have to pay even a plagiarist, as has damaged its trade mark in China, says Pattloh.
Sometimes the law of the jungle reigns here.
There is also the famous case of the graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost the lawsuit against the manufacturer of construction machinery Sany, now that is not long before the company acquired a manufacturer of concrete pumps, Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the logo, similar to the star of Mercedes.
Geely bought Volvo company originally used the blue-and- white logo resembling a BMW; process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost imitators in China from Hong Kong and Singapore, among which the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider myself guilty.
Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing confirmed that in 2010 due to lack of staff and equipment of the premises there were difficulties.
But last year there was a "return of emergency in the workflow to normal."
Thus, the number of untreated cases of objections has decreased by 22 percent.
It has been closed almost 57,000 such cases, 75 percent more than last year.
However 81.500 claims are still waiting in the production department.
Fighting this is expensive
Like so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for the Protection of trademarks, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This record means that China is the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations in the world, according to the Office.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million.
In 2011 it was 1.8 billion yuan paid fees.
If you simplify, it means that each record is an average of 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
To challenge its worth many times more, as shown by the case of German family-owned company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years of fighting against the Chinese concern plagiarist.
The Germans managed to achieve what they illegal production of counterfeit automotive parts were eliminated.
However, the simulator has secured the rights to the Chinese trademark of Freudenberg.
It was his own omission, as the name in Germany are not protected, says Hanno Venttsler, chairman of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And Registered Trademark Office rejected the claim CTMO Munich.
However, in both these instances Freudenberg won, but the other party continues to fight to this day.
Need to be alert
Now the issue is pending before the Supreme Court.
Venttsler hopes to bring it to a good end, and praised the professionalism of courts.
But he also said : "The process is extremely expensive and takes up a lot of time, money and nerves."
Internal costs can hardly be accounting, the company had to look through the archive, even acts of a century ago to lead evidence.
Five years ago, to no avail Freudenberg suggested the opposite party "big six-figure sum in euros" for the settlement.
"It is clear to us how expensive it is," - says Venttsler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over even into Europe.
Namely, if there simulators will register for an unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather goods.
Concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this failed to prevent the registration.
"We need to be alert," - says Venttsler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloh recommend German companies to be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on the international provisions on the protection of trademarks, most foreigners should be "all that is in any way worth protecting, also recorded in China," - says Venttsler.
Otherwise it can not do much more than check.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lose in the last act of the drama of his trade mark, it will have to pay the other party license fees for their own name, explains Venttsler.
Otherwise, we displace from the market in the contested segment.

World AIDS Day : stamped his, to sing, to help
In Heidelberg choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans enjoy it.
The history of relations that have overcome a distance of over 8733 kilometers.
Please hear pritopyvanie : cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' and men's sneaker pumps pick the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two- three - four.
Only then slowly build up singers' voices - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they come, charming and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, 29 -year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his cloth shoes when it leads them flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology, Heidelberg Imbongi choir rehearsing a new song.
At the rehearsal came fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years, from a specialist in human genetics to the janitor.
"Om" Aubagne " - not an easy thing, every voice choir has its text, in addition to a completely alien language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate Unaids, the United Nations program on AIDS, there are about 34 million HIV- infected people.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, home to 245,000 AIDS orphans.
With more than 40 percent of the population are HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village Esitzheni union Voices for Africa has found patrons in Germany.
70 of them are in school, preparing for further study.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take patronage.
It guarantees a child money for school uniforms and daily hot lunch at Gogo center.
Imbongi a Zulu word meaning storyteller or claque.
In this room do not speak fluently on the Bantu, but they can sing.
For almost ten years the choir rehearses songs on this foreign language soft and at times even brings them back to where they first appeared : the South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers from the summer of Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the votes of the German choir.
Forty percent of the infected
They live about 2000 people, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants of many children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents, who had died from the virus ICH.
In Esitzheni reflected in miniature of the disease in Swaziland: the highest rates of HIV infection, the world's lowest life expectancy according to UNICEF.
Circumcision in men, which is proven to reduce the risk of infection by half of the population is almost not accepted.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland are carrying immunodeficiency virus, the death of the middle thirties - are not uncommon.
Choir opened the village in a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants Imbogni saw a lot of children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply all: food, clothing and education.
No school education a person in a poor country does not have any sort of chance.
At first it was a private undertaking individual members - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to once a day to get a hot meal.
But a year later founded the association choir "Voices for Africa", which has since almost professionally care for AIDS orphans in Esitzheni.
Facts about infections, sexually transmitted
What are the most important diseases, sexually transmitted infections?
By bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
What are the primary effects of the band?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are found mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute comes from the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany, the transmission is through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults frequently occurring diseases, sexually transmitted chlamydial infections are trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and the human papilloma virus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults have relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections account for this group.
Chlamydial infections among young people are significantly more likely than other groups.
According to European data, three quarters of all infections affect young people 15 to 25 years.
Our youth are also common human papilloma virus.
How does the number of cases of infection?
Not all diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections in 2007, is reduced.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
With infectious diseases can occur in the genital ulcers, complaints during urination, discharge, pain in the abdomen, as well as vesicles or seal.
However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain undetected.
How can I protect myself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide absolute protection.
After all, in part pathogens of sexually transmitted infections can be spread by contact and infection and in close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular screening, especially for frequent change of sexual partners.
With early detection, most STIs can be cured, and to avoid long-term effects.
Patronage and donations and not least royalties for choir performances throughout Germany can build something.
"In total, we were sent to Esitzheni for about 200,000 euros," says Annette Lennartts, chairman of the association.
In the village itself manages money from Germany Tsodva Dlamini, conscious and active woman.
She also cares about making orphans were well arranged, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as it is called in the old Zulu women, is the support of the village.
Some of them have taken as many as 14 orphans, give them a roof over your head and take care of the children in the form of daily time appeared in the classroom.
Those who have gone native, come to the shelter to Haniysile, a single woman receiving a salary from the union, as well as the two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, the association of "Voices for Africa" organized a sewing school, built a chicken coop and two together with the American health organization PSI organized the delivery of HIV testing for many of the villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but a disease that is so evident throughout the country, prefer deep silence.
King with 14 wives
"AIDS - is an absolute taboo" - says Annette Lennartts - "because it is connected with sexuality."
Quite unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
Last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle also lays the blame for the fact that ICH virus has spread so rapidly in the past years.
But she is also working on a stray who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms is literally on every corner, says Annette Lennartts, " but they hardly use.
Another culture - flesh to flesh. "
To maintain a little cultural exchange, the chorus Ibmogni every two or three years touring the south of Africa and sings songs full of sadness, morale, confidence and self-consciousness of black, which many on the southern edge of the black continent known since the days of apartheid.
Bus full of white men who sing songs in a black tongue - is recognized not only brings good cheer and joy, but even happened, causing tears to the eyes of the harsh frontier guards.
The trip also always leads to Esitzheni where singers attend the sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley Etsulveni it is more than well known.
"Go to the Esitzheni there light" - say the people here.
And after the 8733 -kilometer trip back to Heidelberg, where singers stomping back to the rehearsal room on the street Berghaymer, you can see that the lights are on here as well.

Instant Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
Probe "Messenger" has found evidence that the planet Mercury is the ice.
Ice cover may have a thickness of 20 meters.
U.S. space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closer to the Sun, there is also a frozen water, as is evident from the three studies published Thursday in a special journal Science.
Probe "Messenger" has found evidence that the permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and perhaps even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or perhaps an asteroid colliding with Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the supervisor of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life were in other places the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the earth probes, telescopes and small robots, such as "Phoenix", exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send back to Earth images: small windows into the infinite distance.
The image comes from the camera, which was developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, under the new definition, the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet."
This piece Infrared Telescope snapshot "Spitzer" is a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars are the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, more difficult to identify in the star circle pink "newborn" star.
This region of star - scientists call it unromantic W5 - open telescope "Spitzer" in the constellation Cassiopeia, a distance of 6,500 light years.
This iridescent glow dying star photographed by NASA telescope, "Spitzer."
Similar to a donut ring consists of material that has thrown a star in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, a remote 5,400 light-years from Earth, of gas and dust, there are new stars.
NASA telescope, "Spitzer" took this picture of the galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also known as the "Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope colors are better.

It is located at a distance of 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
The similarities with the Earth's continent has brought this nebula nicknamed "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive color reproduction.
This new star in the beauty managed to photograph only with infrared sensors telescope, "Spitzer."
Saturn and its rings : As they emerged - one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps it is the pieces of the moon of Saturn, which had disappeared 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and most clear pictures of the telescope "Hubble" : The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color images of spiral galaxies are transformed into works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory image shows the removal of a few thousand light-years Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (ternary, tripartite), as dark dust lanes are divided into three parts red-hot heart of the cradle of the stars.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers have photographed a harbinger of cosmic collisions : a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the core of two merging galaxies rushing towards each other and inevitably face.
This is the birth of a star telescope "Hubble" took off in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like the technical abbreviations can call her by her nickname "Southern Pinwheel".
Photo space telescope "Hubble" shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
Nebula, distant light years 1400 consists of dust particles sizes of from ten to one hundred times smaller than a conventional house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, the remote for 430 million light- years from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 photographed for NASA space telescope "Hubble".
Most scientists call a spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
Star Cradle constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, coupled with the Rosette Nebula, also constantly creating new stars - a distance of 5,000 light- years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole has no dust, gas only.
The researchers suggest that it originated long before the Big Bang, when the universe had mostly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe : the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem - even before Galileo Galilei one year later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirror optical telescopes got bigger - and available to their view of the space deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the telescope "Hale" in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
Mirror, as shown here, has a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, United States, is set to "Large Binocular Telescope."
It allows you to look into space by means of two mirrors, each 8.4 meters in diameter.
"Gran Canarias Telescopes" has a huge interior - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
Mirror "Great South African telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of reducing the cost.
Nevertheless it reaches a diameter of approximately eleven meters.
The lack of low-cost designs: telescope rigidly attached to a vertical angle - it limits his mobility.
Telescope "Hobby- Eberly" in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature : high light gathering ability.
It reaches - in spite of the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the world's largest telescopes parameters.
Using a radio telescope at Arecibo (Puerto Rico), the researchers listened to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the project "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the Astronomical Observatory of European life (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is "Very Large Telescope" - the title says.
Its four mirrors allow the telescope to illuminate even the middle infrared spectrum.
In the Chilean Observatory ESO also plan to install a European "Very Large Telescope".
Its main mirror must be spread on as much as 42 meters - and is made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the photos should be expected no earlier than 2018.
By 2007 goda municipal administration telescope "Keck" in gavayskom volcano Mauna Kea schitalisy krupneyshimi Receive.
They are equipped with two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
Telescopes "Keck" are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them looking at the sky through telescopes and "Subaru" and IRTTF.
In addition, the Mauna Kea should be a new giant telescope - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here they can enjoy the illustration.
However, the most important species from space provides space telescope "Hubble".
On 24 April 1990 he delivers pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope "Kepler" looking for planets outside our solar system - especially those on which life is possible.
February 2, 2011 NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets found since the beginning of the mission.
The photograph depicted the final preparations for space telescope "Kepler".
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 on board the rocket "Ariane 5".
The primary mirror infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of a telescope: it has about the world of the first stars and galaxies look for the big bang.
Scientists suggest that the south pole of Mercury ice.
However, reliable data on this, as the "Messenger" is rotated closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over the decades have pointed to the fact that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks launched in 2004 probe "Messenger" - the first, which revolves around Mercury - scientists are now sure of that.

Drink the oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach for biblical venerable age.
There is even a museum longevity.
Search for clues in a country where 97 -year- old men seem to be still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach for biblical venerable age.
There is even a museum longevity.
Search for clues in a country where 97 -year- old men seem to be still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called a wild and romantic.
Minibus with rumblings rolls along a winding road, past rolling hills overgrown with thick forests, gushing rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything is so green and bright that you would think that you are in the Black Forest.
But it is the most southern edge of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is just a few kilometers from here.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they had a say in Farsi and azerbayzhdanskom and are long-lived.
The final point is Lerik.
Small town brags too heavy-handed Soviet-era architecture, which is not in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost never come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious.
At 323 kilometers away eight hours because the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth, which the country owes oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province until it got.
But Pilate Fatullayev (48) is convinced that in Lerik have something to interest tourists.
"In May, Baku became famous Festival Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world" - says Fatullayev.
It - Director of the Museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here documented biography about eight dozen Talysh of these places, which are more than 100 years. Fatullayev points to black-and- white photo.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years, he fathered another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
Birth, however, do not.
And given the fact that the oldest person whose age is confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, the age of Myuslyumova seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in the area in 1805, died in 1973," - explains Fatullayev.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, aged 136 years, he allegedly had a daughter.
So we added a shepherd Myuslyumov couple of decades to my age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, researcher age of the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
"It's amazing a lot of older people can be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," - says Scholz, "also lives in Sardinia is extremely a lot of very old people."
However, due to the lack of scientific proof of age document is not possible, because there was no civil status registers.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, there is the fact that people in the area Lerika strikingly often reach the biblical age.
Is now home to 20 people older than 100 years.
Why here in the south, as many centenarians?
Azerbaijani Farid Mugimzade guide explains the special genes Talysh.
Fatullayev director of the museum, on the contrary, believes that the case for food.
Talishs fond of meat, bread, and most dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day. But it is unlikely such a high-calorie diet can be healthy with a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the primitive way of life that keeps young people? In Chengemirane, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzoeva.
In 97 years, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, which claims that it has 143 child lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil that rolls back and forth without getting tired.
Here are living under the same roof, eight people, including one of his sons and a daughter Mizraeva who have long been their grandchildren.
Also nearby are jumping two kids.
The kitchen can prepare tea, which is served in a typical pot-bellied jars Armudu.
We Mizraeva perfectly smooth and strong white teeth, a head scarf she hides the long dark -blond braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk, so they never get lost and saved color.
"And I never used the shampoo," - says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what is grown in your own backyard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
For all my life I have never shopped at the store.
Then she talks about her husband, who served in the military.
The hardest part was after the Second World War.
But it became better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled as a dictator in Azerbaijan virtually no limits.
He was in power until 2003, then took over the reins of his son Ilham.
Nevertheless, among the old Azerbaijani no poverty.
230 manat (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly from pensions to local conditions is the amount for which you can live well.
And, perhaps, for a long time, too, grew up the son of Mizraeva right: "Old men in our culture are in deep respect."
They live in a big family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
What is not a reason to stay alive as long as possible

The word "human right" is not in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
The rival demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep split in the country.
Future constitution based on Sharia, has met fierce resistance.
Egyptian president did not skimp on the pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And its success is my responsibility to the people and to God," - he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all people, but especially to the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular Egyptians.
After all, they are still hopelessly fragmented opposition in a confused, afraid.
The fear of a religious state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful "Muslim Brotherhood."
Mohammed Mursi, almost apologetically said that he temporarily cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and extended its jurisdiction "to save the revolution."
But what really wants to save the 61 -year-old engineer, has a doctorate in American University of Southern California, it is not clear the Egyptians and the world.
Will the judiciary lacks power?
In fact, Article 234 managed to push through the night 15 -hour grind on Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 members, and it is partly a concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that legal proceedings based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles"?
It was and still is a matter of interpretation, and it is possible to fear that Islamists will use vague wording and arising in connection with the legal clearance for the stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
At the very least, this suggests a newly introduced article: in all matters relating to Shariah, should be involved to the Board of the University of Al - Ashar, the most important Islamic institution in the country, is widely respected throughout the Sunni Islam.
It should not, but it could mean that the clergy oversees legislation that de facto would be a consequence of the restriction of the judiciary.
The draft constitution is the subject of much interpretation
Another problem that should continue jurisdiction of civilians to military courts.
These courts during Mubarak's government were to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of a dictator in military custody were up to 11,000 civilians.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect the "true essence of Egyptian family" and "to maintain its morals and values ."
Legally it is worded so vaguely that government agencies through this article will be able to control even the content of films and literature.
Plaintext, this means neither more nor less than censorship.
In general, no article establishes the equality of men and straight women.
But the other prohibits insulting and defaming the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But that is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
Also questionable is the wording that prohibited "an insult to the people."
Is it enough to be caricatures of the president or the jokes about lawyer?
The question of interpretation, like so much of the project, which offers a signature Mursi and which, in his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to a referendum.
"The revolution has returned"
For weeks, the opposition formed against Islamist supremacy.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in an unusual unanimity Friday night in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to destroy the document before it can enter into force.
"The revolution is back and we will win," - said Hamdin Sabbah, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Minister Mohammed el -Baradei said that the draft constitution be "on the ash heap of history."
Via Short news Twitter he accused supporters of Mursi in the desire to lead a "coup against democracy."
"If he will announce a referendum, we will go to his palace, and his tabernacle," - said the opposition leader Yasser Said.
"We're not tired, the blood of our brothers have not yet avenged" - quoted the Egyptian media opposition leader Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"Koran - our konstituciя"
Well-organized "Muslim Brotherhood", in turn, called for a demonstration opposite, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, and after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and supporters Salafis, who shouted : "The people demand the application of God's law."
Oni potrebovali enabled Moors : "Cleanse sides!" and verified "Koran - our konstituciя".
The struggle for control of the symbolic area, where it all began, the condition is almost provoked a civil war.
Followers of the Mursi, quite obviously, did not want to take that risk.
"The Muslim Brotherhood," said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loud and clear.
Now it's time to give the people decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
Most of the project Islamists, it is considered a done deal.
"The concept of" human rights "is not mentioned even once"
Hafiz Syed Abu outraged by this forced the constitutional process, which, in fact, was to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
48 -year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOPR) defended the "Muslim Brotherhood" when under Mubarak they were in prison or brought to trial.
Not because he shared their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this, he was beaten and sentenced, was arrested.
And now the words "human rights" was never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Expanding the influence of Mursi on all three branches of government in the state attorney disappointing.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
"Rather than strengthen civil state, the president de facto overruled it" - sorry Syed.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy can not function.
Syed feels that all abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological battle lines on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It can lead to retribution.
A protester in Tahrir Square, warns: "You create a monster you can not control."

Norwegian rakfisk : the most foul- smelling fish in the world?
In the five million population in Norway is one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Perhaps the secret of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local predilection for one very smelly fish dish?
Take a few pieces of overripe cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will smell the smell otshibayuschy rakfiska - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I 'm in a little town called Fagernes, three hours drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered scenic views. It's very beautiful, but the air is diffused indestructible characteristic odor.
Rakfisk - it's trout, sprinkle with salt and fermented in water up to a year, depending on what exactly you need to get ducky.
As the dusk and the cold, the crowd of Norwegians are going to a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, shall we say, a spectacular dish.
"It is eaten raw and washed down with a glass of aquavit, local caraway vodka" - explains Håvard Halvarsen, a local fireman by profession and in combination "rakfiskovy general", who runs the festival.
All around us people eat fish cut into small cubes and wash down with her considerable portions of alcohol.
"Some people prefer aquavit than rakfisk" - says Havard.
This drink is able to kill the smell.
I try a couple of pieces.
If we manage to carry the piece under his nose, then it's not so bad - not unlike portions of sushi, you drove a long time with him on the bus.
Rakfisk - a Norwegian product from completely different times, the times of poverty, when, before the advent of refrigeration, fish fall soaked in sealed barrels of salt water.
Then, in the dead of winter, when the fish are well and thoroughly fermented, it recovered and, by reducing the perception of alcohol consumed as food.
More on the memory of the previous generation of the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and to emigrate, mainly in the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants who are here involve jobs, higher wages and a developed system of social security.
Residents of Sweden (longtime rival, and not so long ago and far more prosperous neighbor) massively come here to work.
Rakfisk perceived as a significant symbol, of course, if somewhat fetid last element Norway.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you £ 9 ($ 14).
Norway is rarely seen in world news, and most of the inhabitants of the country it seems to be satisfied.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the racist and right-wing extremist, last year shot and killed 77 men, women and children.
Without mentioning his name, called the attack "happened on July 22."
Norwegians are very hard to believe that in their peace-loving country, one of their fellow citizens should be capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of today's well-being is the growth of Norway (early seventies), one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
"However, the oil - not the only reason for our prosperity," - says Anna, our waitress that carry trays of seasoned rakfiskom, a woman with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes, the embodiment of the Nordic welfare.
We are a people - as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she is fluent in English.
We do not like to exhibit at the show, we do not boastful.
Norway is drawn very carefully with its oil - most of the oil and gas revenues are invested in a special fund set up for the benefit of future generations.
In the years before the global financial crisis, when all littered with money, which they did not have, Norway frugally counted all costs.
"As long as you can go skiing in winter and hiking in summer, it is sufficient for happiness," - says Anna.
"And there rakfisk" - she adds with a carefree laugh.
I 'm standing in the snow waiting in line for some food - rakfiska had enough.
Here's a burger with elk meat - that's exactly exotic, tasty juicy meat.
But in the evening we will see even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel have a special dinner celebrating rakfisk, during which visitors vote determine the best or perhaps the most flavorful fish.
There is a live television broadcast in which show host in a bow tie, surrounded by plates of rakfiskom.
It's like the song contest "Eurovision".
"So, Tor- Jurgen, what grade you set for the best fish there for themselves in the mountains?"
"Yes, Havard, vote our assessment"....
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair may exhausting aquavit.
Or maybe just inhaling the smell of the fish.

President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto have a difficult career start.
While the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the challenges that it faces and to mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly poor condition.
This city is overloaded with traffic and at the best time, and Monday were erected steel fences, cut several main highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was not done in order to prevent people to get to work from the suburbs, and to prevent the protesters go to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto put on the presidential sash and take the reins of the country.
In front of him is not an easy task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance during the administration of Felipe Calderon, who now puts his powers, but the country is mired in a war on drugs, which in six years has claimed about 60,000 lives.
"My government says the Mexican people about their willingness to fight violence" - said earlier this week, Mr. Peña Nieto U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House.
I'm going to offer a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Until such statements next to the U.S. president 's political career, Mr. Peña Nieto has developed as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In his country, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital city, the views of the new leadership was divided.
The straight man
In the idyllic village of Valle de Bravo, for example, think about it fondly.
Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of resort areas and infrastructure.
Before the city can be reached by one of the new highway, built ith Peña Nieto, who are very different from the roads with potholes and pits that were previously on the site.
Signs with his name hanging on the modern building of the sports center and on the spectacular interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We connect with it hope for a real and serious changes," - says his friend and political ally of Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, headed by State Rep. Peña Nieto of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We expect real and radical changes that are so desperately needed in our country, especially in the field of security and economic development.
After '81 continuous stay in power the party PRI was ousted in 2000, Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years of absence from the presidential palace Los Pinos party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes allegations of emptiness, which the opposition has put forward a new president.
It is very straightforward and very dedicated to the cause of realization of his vision of the future of the country.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a man who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different view of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nes, is a most striking contrast to the cobblestone streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the highway overpasses, in many ways, it is a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are too harsh nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, for the suppression of gang selling drugs in these areas have been brought troops, but violence against women is particularly acute here.
In a vacant lot near a vast landfill in the last two years, they found several dozen dead bodies of women.
More than a thousand women have been killed in Mexico State during the Governorship of Mr. Peña Nieto - is much higher than a similar figure in the became notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez, whose name has become a household name when it comes to murder innocent women.
According to opponents of Mr. Peña Nieto about it, at best, it can be said that during his tenure as governor, he was unable to cope with the problem of femicide.
In the worst case, however, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of the concrete house, like most houses in a dilapidated neighborhood, Irenaeus Buendia barely holding back tears, showing me pictures of his deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Marian in 2010 committed suicide.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her live-in boyfriend.
"When I got to her house, it seemed that her body was washed before it" - says Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body is numbed.
Mother Mariana retells the story, and a portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall where it hangs next to the crucifix, which is inscribed on one word : fairness.
It is in this, according to them, was denied to this family.
" Officials of the State treated me like an old gossip, unhappy offending tranquility.
They want people to just take for granted all that they say, and kept quiet.
But it is wrong, you can not, especially when there are so many irregularities and deficiencies, "- she said.
Donning the presidential sash on Saturday, President Peña Nieto with her take on the difficult responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected crime of violence, and the new president promised to solve this problem a priority during his presidency.
"I hope that it will be the same president as he was governor," - says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the party PRI.
Yet this is what is most feared families of the victims in Ciudad Nesa.

Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment, said the prosecution.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning of the poor conditions of detention.
At the hearing, special attention was paid to stay Manning in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands to close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning's been brutal.
U.S. Army private accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not get many opportunities to make a complaint about the treatment, which, according to him, he had to move while in military custody.
During cross-examination of the pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, a military prosecutor, Major Eshden Fein said Manning's record of weekly visits by representatives of the prison for the first nine months of his detention in Quantico, Va., contain no complaints about the treatment.
The cross-examination in the examination of the application protection to dismiss Manning on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were harsh and of themselves were sufficient punishment, was held the next day after Manning said that while in custody, he had intended to commit suicide.
Military Analyst intelligence, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the website of WikiLeaks.
Resource WikiLeaks has not confirmed that the source of the information was just Manning.
During a hearing on Friday, Attorney Fein along with Manning looked at the reports that were filled after visits Manning administration officials during his stay in prison, Quantico, where he was subject to the strict prison regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits to prison officials asking Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When the prosecutor asked Fein on Friday on reports, Manning acknowledged that evaluates treatment on the part of the prison as "excellent", and the general terms and conditions as "very professionally organized."
The above statements do not include complaints about the treatment, despite the fact that Manning was asked directly about the conditions of his detention, says Fein.
Manning said he has expressed concern over these oral problems and that his administration officials visited discussed with him the problems and said that they will be engaged, but did not record it in writing.
"They did" no problem "(after discussing my complaints), but that does not mean that I did not raise this issue in an interview," - says Manning.
The military judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain of ill-treatment of them in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission that examined suicidal ideation, which he expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning said that during that meeting, he wanted to ensure that he was cleared mode "injury prevention" and softened the conditions of detention.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited regime of detention - at a lower level than the supervisory regime to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
"I wanted to know the administration, that I was all right, so they canceled the mode of injury prevention... to the level of my life has improved, from my point of view," - said Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before transferred to the prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that suicidal thoughts appeared in his Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to intense heat.
He explained that psychologically very hard when you do not give to know how to solve your fate, and what is happening in the outside world.
" My world has shrunk to the base Camp Arifzhan, to the size of my prison - Manning said Thursday.
- I thought I was going to die in this cage. "
While at Quantico, Manning, according to him, spent most of his time in a small cell - at least 21 hours, and sometimes even more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning said that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, slippers, a few items of clothing and goggles.
He says he tried to move, as the sleep or even lie down during the day forbade the rules.
According to Manning, while sleeping in his eyes constantly beat the light coming from outside the chamber.
If the guards did not see his face when he rolled over in bed at night, then, according to him, woke him and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning's lawyer has filed a formal objection to the unlawful treatment of Manning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
In addition, the judge on Friday questioned Manning about a statement he made during his testimony on Thursday that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates on the morning test.
Manning said he had not been able to cover up with a blanket during checkout.
Responding to questions from the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the order of the guard, that should throw blanket, which could hide behind, but admitted that no one explicitly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said that the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because it attempts to show the officer that he is not a danger to himself.
Manning said that the officer said that he could use the panty elastic or slippers to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, flip-flops and sunglasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers are hoping that the judge, at least, will take into account the fact that he had to endure while in custody, and will significantly reduce the term of imprisonment, if Manning is convicted by a military court, which is to begin consideration of his case at the beginning of next year.
Defence said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty for lesser crimes, while others dispute the charges as excessive.
The resumption of the hearing scheduled for this weekend, it is expected that the prosecution will insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained in Quantico, in accordance with the rules governing the content of those arrested with maximum security.
Among the charges Manning, listed as aiding the enemy, the illegal promotion of disclosure of data on the Internet, the transmission of information relating to the national defense, and the kidnapping of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life in prison.

My crisis of national self-determination - the story of Mexican Americans.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities to realize.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind people of the country about difficult times.
Ruben Navarrete believes that American-born Mexicans are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the hall for arriving, close to the border control zone and froze.
Signs point to two queues, one for Mexicanos (Mexican), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I have a few seconds stood before them, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I had not been called Mexican.
It's just a code name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York, consider themselves Italians.
Later, I stopped at the complex design "Mexican American."
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, the birthplace of my grandfather, there was no need for conventional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can not get rid of the American accent.
Because I got my American passport and was in the queue for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
The agenda for meetings of the presidents of customary these countries issues : immigration, drugs and trafficking.
The President Peña Nieto was eager to talk about the rise of the Mexican economy that Mexicans now, might as well be able to remain in Mexico, rather than move to the United States.
He wants to sign a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create a North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, the president of Pena Nieto promised to continue the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were heard.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States - a heavy and full of old grudges question.
Most Americans have never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and the barrel of rifles forced their leaders to give up half of its territory.
But Mexicans are thinking for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of the events in all.
Therefore it is necessary only to any statesman bad break though the word of criticism toward Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society immediately heard complaints that the Americans encroaching on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma was filled with militancy.
The most difficult are the relations of Mexico with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican descent living in the United States.
Want to talk about the wrongs?
Enough of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are in this country for themselves of the opportunity, and those for whom there is no such possibility.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio are so many people of Mexican origin for one reason : at some point in their family history anyone - father or grandfather - was not able to fulfill themselves in Mexico and was forced to go to the north.
Most of these were Mexicans specific type - dark-skinned, educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember it.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today our lives - is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and get a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream - the American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know what country to consider their own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that the majority of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We respond to them in kind.
They see us as a reminder of the humiliating defeats, and treat us like second-class citizens, how to fake Mexicans.
We speak a little Spanish, and our relationship with Mexico is not strong enough.
Our very existence is due to their failure.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be right now for a silk curtain, finding a comfortable life in the United States, but lost the spiritual connection.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the U.S. as a child, and it reminds me of the fact that between these Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent there was some friction - Mexicans are clearly aware of their national identity, and Mexican Americans is insulting.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes that it belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my fellow Americans of Mexican descent do not feel accessory to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but love and Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of both worlds, you will inevitably lose the roots.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
In the U.S., we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship already confusing enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the Diaspora.
They want to Mexican Americans have worked a kind of ambassadors of Mexico and represented her interests in the United States.
We could tell his fellow Americans about what a beautiful country and a great visit it, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It will not work.
Too many injuries in the past.
And given the gap between rich and poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so much lovely.
Sorry, but to deal with this yourself, amigos.
And rightfully so.
If the majority of Mexicans still can not forgive the United States the way they did with Mexico a half -century ago, they would have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still mad for the way recently in Mexico have done with their relatives.
That along.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.

The old battle on a new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas's may be a fragile foundation for the future of the world
Is a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes the conclusion of the futility of such hopes.
Sounds that have become habitual, mindless debate about who started it, many buildings reduced to rubble, killed more than 140 Palestinians, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis, for the first time during the conflict, issued from Gaza rockets landed in the vicinity Israel's capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly mired in its age-old conflict in the Middle East came to change.
To this can be treated differently, but the events of the "Arab Spring" in the breakaway storm whirled many well-established reality, with the Israelis and the Palestinians could not stay away from the vortex that shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle to become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate.
The war without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give grounds for optimism.
Even if the cease-fire agreement which was signed on November 21, will run that occurred this week only strengthened the position of the collision security officials from both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas took power in Gaza in 2007, said on the fact that they forced Israel to withdraw, despite the losses incurred by them.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were killed and 1.7 million people are locked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is increasing its popularity in the West Bank - another Palestinian -controlled territory is now more moderate Fatah.
Moreover, the leaders of Hamas may well come to the conclusion that time is on their side.
With the growing influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world in Hamas are new influential and wealthy friends.
Reviving a regional leader in Turkey, which was once Israel's closest ally among Muslim countries, made with the support of Hamas, and its example was followed by Qatar, one of the richest and fastest growing states in the Persian Gulf.
The triumphant Hamas supporters say the creation of an Islamic crescent around Israel - from Lebanon to the north, which rules the militant group Hezbollah, to Syria, where more and more about proislamistskie rebels overthrow Bashar al- Assad's power, and then to Jordan, where the king's power threaten allies Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of forces in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the President Mohammed Mursi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who does not pay special attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, in contrast, is an organization in many ways similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic arrangements of Hamas could become a significant player, whose voice can not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, proponents of the "hard" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli missile defense system "Iron Dome" has justified the cost of creating and successfully destroyed many of the rockets launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep easy, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained true to its unwavering position, many European countries are also blamed for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, particularly in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004 about 30 Israelis were killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel was able to minimize the problem of suicide, in part through the wall that goes to the West Bank of the Jordan River - a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian state - and protects the Jewish settlements, which continue to grow despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the planned January 22 elections - has teamed up with an even more aggressive-minded conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point to indulge the Palestinians and give them their own state?
If you give in their hands all the power in the West Bank, if they do not start to run out rockets at Israel, as do their counterparts in the Gaza Strip?
It is better to keep them behind a wall and hard to suppress any attempts to lift the head.
Perhaps the proponents of the "hard" line will win, but their calculations can be refuted by the Arab Spring.
Given that the Islamists come to power in Egypt and other countries, do not have the warmest feelings towards Israel, their priority will be domestic problems.
Part of Israel 's defense budget is greater than that of all its Arab neighbors combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help the governments of the Arab countries to strengthen their own economies.
Pragmatism is the President of Egypt, Mursi, which together with Barack Obama worked on a cease-fire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of a change.
Israel, no less, has to take into account the long-term consequences of their policies.
With the onset of democratic change in the Arab world, the deprivation of the right of Palestinians to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression has undermined the foundations of the democratic order in a Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
During the bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress Hamas, have to pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external pulse
It remains the only solution to which constantly urge sensible representatives from both sides, and most of the rest of the world and our paper : the formation of the two states and territories concessions by Israel in exchange for security.
There is a hope, not too impressive in the short term - the hope that the ceasefire would allow other countries to better influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which for a long time it is time to make a decision to cut off supplies of weapons to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar have, as ever, advantageous position to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state since 1967 and taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
It would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming vote in the UN, which could result in the recognition of a virtual state of Palestine.
His role is to sit down Israel to the negotiating table must play and President Obama.
During his first term, he has not presented his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he continues to show reluctance to be connected to the problem.
This is a catastrophic short-sighted attitude.
The United States have a vital interest in the stability of the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

In Australia, the law came into force on standardized packaging for cigarettes.
Health warnings and images of diseased body parts contrast with the dull green boxes that are the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice the same type of Australian law on packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logo and color design of various brands of the same box of dull olive green with eerie images of diseased body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by their parents smoking.
In addition to the different images and labels warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced on a mandatory basis this Saturday - brand names, which are printed the same small print.
This is the harshest conditions in the world to design packages of tobacco products.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the purpose of this measure - to keep young people from smoking, depriving the habit of the fashion status.
The basis of this decision based on the results of studies showing that people do not start smoking before 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
"It is clear that even in a very young age, children understand the meaning of that tobacco companies are trying to convey by means of packaging," - says Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest proportion of smokers in the world, so that the changes are not particularly affect the profits of multinational corporations, but the possibility of adopting similar measures are already considering other countries.
The tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of the law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold cheap and affordable cigarettes.
"This law will lead to serious consequences other than those conceived by the initiators," - says Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of fake products from China and Indonesia will supply much more of these items for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, however, new laws have contributed to the growth of the business.
Sandra Ha from a small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd argues that the demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases that hide the unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (from scratch) since two months ago, companies such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a case in the high Court of Australia, where they tried to challenge the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico company has already sold about six thousand products wholesale trade and expects the new party.
For us, it's good business.
Potential hindrance to the effectiveness of such measures is, in the opinion of experts, the popularity of social networks is that part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After the adoption of several laws in Australia, who made an illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events, as well as prohibiting cigarette sellers put in a prominent place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has banned local companies and websites to advertise on the network, but it can not limit this foreign sites.
"If you trade in tobacco products, and you were left with this little loophole, the idea is to promote your product online you will find extremely attractive," - says Becky Freeman, exploring issues of public health at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes the increase in the number of reviews of trademarks, written on behalf of the supposedly normal users in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - whether it was the work of an ordinary citizen, who is so fond of cigarettes Marlboro, which did not spare the time and effort and made a movie, or is behind this advertising campaign?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says that the industry is now more concerned with adapting to the new rules, than advertising.
The tobacco industry have even gone to such measures as the sponsorship of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states make a complaint to the World Trade Organization, arguing that trade was subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very small.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tanya Plibersek, the government is discussing with other countries adopting similar laws on their packaging.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce a mandatory placement of the photos, warning about the dangers of smoking.
Now it is generally accepted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Considered the possibility of tighter laws in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
A lot of smokers in Australia deliberately disobey innovation.
These pictures do not hurt me.
I just do not pay attention.
"Just whips out a pack of cigarettes and hiding in your pocket" - says Victor Al Haig, buying cigarettes in photo tumors of the oral cavity on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit - it's my little girl.
James Yu, store manager of tobacco King of the Pack in the heart of Sydney, argues that the same package has complicated the task of placing the goods on the shelves
"I used to have to unload the new party was leaving an hour, and now four o'clock," - he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say, what to do, okay, it's over, close the store," - he says, throwing his hands up.

Bored in the world of electronic networks and persistent connections - it's not so bad.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly had to spend five hours in the airport because of our aircraft mechanical problems were found and it was replaced by another aircraft, and we waited.
Thus, I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight - it's really boring, and there is not much help either books or magazines, or iPhone, or even a duty-free shops.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and experts in child development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics that may contribute to creativity.
And because in today's world we are constantly in front of some screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we need to strive to boredom?
Yes.
At the same time there.
We'll get back to that.
Previously, I, like many, thought that boredom - the invention of relatively recent times, when people have more free time.
It is not, says Peter Thuy, a professor of Greek and Roman history, Canadian University of Calgary, author of "A fascinating story of boredom" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom boasts a very ancient history," - he said.
On the walls in Pompeii Latin inscriptions found about boredom, dating back to the first century.
This leaves open the question of how we understand the boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of the University of York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom changed frequently.
After reviewing the research on this topic and by asking the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition : boredom - is when people "want, but can not do what would have brought them the satisfaction."
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person is not doing something that he wanted to do.
When apathy to do anything you do not want.
Major in boredom experienced by, he says, is "impaired attention and the associated worsening of mood and feeling that time passes slowly."
According to the description boredom may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood said that despite the possible link between these states, bored people see the causes of the problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression, see a problem in itself.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, when in fact it 's just hard to concentrate on anything.
In his study, "An Unused mind : the definition of boredom in terms of attention," published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to the earlier experiments, the participants who listened to the voice recording, reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of irrelevant TV programs included in the next room, others heard the same sound at a low volume, so that they could barely make out, and the third group only listened to the voice recording without any audio track.
Those participants who heard the TV volume is low, indicated that they were bored, most others - it was hard to concentrate, but they do not know the cause of it and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on the exciting and challenging task, interruption of attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we are doing something uninteresting, "for example, looking at the flow of products on an assembly line in search of marriage, distracting music can help prevent boredom."
It is believed, he continues, is that when people start to wiggle in a chair or doodle on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions do not just help to relax physically.
"Research has shown that children who do not forbid to fidget and spin, learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still," - says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all experience the boredom : if the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to the monotonous speech, looking uninteresting film.
However, different people show different degrees of inclination to boredom.
In the 1980s, for the measurement of individual characteristics, researchers have developed a special "scale propensity to boredom."
To determine an estimate on such a scale used questions and statements such as "Much of what I have to do monotonous and monotone" or "I'm too much fun, so everything is not enough time."
With the help of the questionnaires, researchers have found that boys are more often bored girls - said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, young people are often bored at all.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he is contacted by pager with nearly 400 teens and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He obtained the following results : 32% of teens said that they are bored in school and during homework, and 23% said that they are bored outside of school.
However, only 3% of parents said that they are bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no information about what would have similar data about boredom now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "adolescence is the peak tendency to boredom", mainly because children and adolescents do not allow you to fully decide what they do.
Let's go back to my original question : boredom helpful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations it, studies show, can encourage people to absurd and dangerous physical acts, risky gambling or misuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have wondered about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, devoted to the study of this problem for more than two decades.
"So our brain tells us that we should do something else, this is boring," - says Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at New York University.
However, this is the brain does not always know exactly what to do better.
If you get bored and you will direct this energy to play the guitar or culinary experiences, you'll make yourself better.
However, if you get to watch TV, you will get better only for a time, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give it a iPad, it will cease to be bored, but he has learned to deal with boredom alone or under any other way to manage your time and employment - says Professor Fenske.
"But such self- regulation skills are utilized in a variety of situations," - he says.
Your child learns not only to occupy yourself with something yourself, it is also learning self-control at all.
I do not think I need to somehow magnify boredom.
But consider it a bad thing is not worth it.
Rather, it should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"We see it so often that we need to experience boredom, despite the fact that boredom - this is extremely unpleasant, an unquenchable desire to do something meaningful," - he said.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from the constant worries and just relax.
"In today 's world we are accustomed to constant over-stimulation of the senses - he says - and when there is silence, we get lost and do not know what to do."

It is not clear how the new law will apply to legalize marijuana in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, nineteen- player football team and the student community college in southeast Colorado charged with a criminal offense of what will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state : storage of marijuana and a small portion of the tube, in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orozco says that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and riding in a car on the prairie near the border with Kansas, when they were stopped by police.
After police found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to court for possession of drugs and possession of drug paraphernalia - minor offenses, for each of which is owed a fine of$ 100 - and set a date for the hearing.
"We were treated like criminals," - says Mr. Orozco.
But if the offender is he?
As a result of the uncertainty that has continued for several weeks after the Colorado voted to legalize marijuana in small amounts for fun, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as the place of examination.
Allegations of minor offenses related to marijuana, has removed hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which took a similar measure.
Police stations have ceased to press charges for people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses that would be considered legal as soon as a couple of weeks the law comes into force.
However, in more conservative districts Colorado prosecutors have decided to consider the merits associated with marijuana, and still prosecuted for possession of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountains of the West to vote for it in order to prevent the appearance in their new locations, licensed staff of shops selling marijuana.
"All of this is developing so fast that I did not even know what to expect next," - says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora east of Denver.
Representatives of regulatory bodies in the state of Washington also puzzled scratching his head.
They will have to create rules to determine the order of licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado is good or bad, is ahead of most other states in the resolution of questions of use of marijuana for medical purposes at first, but now for fun.
"In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example," - says Brian J. Smith, a spokesman for the Council to regulate the production and marketing of alcoholic beverages in the state of Washington.
But no one can do more, admits Mr. Smith than to put forward some suggestions and hope that it will work.
"We have no real precedent on which we could focus," - he said.
The Bill of Washington, called I- 502, come into force on 6 December and the whole year will plunge state into a state of uncertainty, when the system of state licensing yet, and the right of possession of marijuana is legalized.
And there 's still difficult technical issues to be solved in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the order of the State of "adequate access" to a licensed marijuana with a ban on the trade of a distance of 1,000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
"It is particularly difficult to locate licensed trading companies marijuana in the city, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs," - says Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group "Center for the legalization of marijuana."
Nov. 21 Police Chief Oates of Aurora sent his subordinates to an email message that the Prosecutor's Office will no longer attract persons under the age of 21, to account for the possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stops to convict people in these violations, "starting from this moment".
The police chief Oates said police will monitor compliance in the rules governing the activities of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and will prosecute traffickers and drug dealers.
Weld County District Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is a more rigorous approach to the subject.
After the vote on the bill, he said that his office will continue to prosecute for possession of marijuana, mainly in order to encourage people to use it for treatment.
Currently 119 persons charged with possession of two ounces or less of marijuana, even though many of them are accused and other violations.
"The duty of the institution - be prosecuted for acts that are considered criminal at the time they were committed," - said Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed, even in places such as rural Mesa County, where members vote rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police Grand Junction, the largest town in the county, more than being called to account for the adult possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hauttsinger upheld the decision, but also decided not to withdraw the charges on already open cases related to marijuana possession.
"I believe that to enforce the law as long as it does not change - our duty," - he said.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote in favor of this decision, the inclusion of the use of marijuana for entertainment in the state and the legal system will not be easy.
A controversial reaction of residents in different parts of the state revealed the ambiguity of the relationship of the local authorities to experiment with marijuana state.
"I district attorneys in this matter there is a cultural barrier," - says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing convicted of possession of marijuana, and a local representative of the National Organization for the reform of the laws on marijuana.
"They 've been chasing people for this, that now can not truly accept the fact that this is not a crime," - he said.
Colorado and Washington - the first state in which a small amount of marijuana are the same as for alcohol - is destined to become an experimental field across the country to test the idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time, they cautiously await instructions from the federal authorities, who are still planning to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Supporters of legalizing marijuana are hoping that the Justice Department will give way in this matter.
Despite several arrests have received considerable attention of traders and patients who use marijuana for medical reasons, the federal government in most cases, has given the nod to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of Narcotics are unlikely to break into the house to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to become blind to the state government regulated recreational marijuana shops, which are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser the fight against drugs in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of federal authorities.
Even before the presidential elections, some local governments have approved a moratorium on the opening of new stores for the sale of marijuana, and so are not able to open earlier than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a town in the western part of the state, has put forward to the six-month ban on the trade in marijuana, which is likely to be approved next week.
"We do not want to be in such a position that we will issue a license to someone, then it will cause serious problems at the federal level," - says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our town voted against the amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local election and the fact that he voted for the staff.
There are still many unresolved issues.

Petronella Uayett : I survived from Oxford for the fact that I am a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not start today.
As long as I can remember, I always wanted to go to Oxford University.
My father and older brother went to Oxford, and described it as the best school in the world, the modern equivalent of the ancient symposium lays two pillars of civilization - freedom of thought and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of study at the Faculty of History of Worcester College, Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed up and left, which resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father broke down and cried.
Friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I dropped out of college because I did not like that my classmates are having sex in the next room.
Writer Norman E. Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from a chipped cup.
In fact, it was not so funny.
I ran away.
Yes, run away, because I was systematically persecuted and intimidated.
It is not because of my rather unusual name, or the fact that I attended a private school.
I hunted for one reason only, and that illustrious cradle of enlightenment, it looked real barbarism and blind fanaticism, my father, the late Woodrow Uayett, was a renowned advisor, Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You may ask, why think about it now?
According to recent reports, the new generation of students, adhering to the views of the center-right, subject to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and growing hatred of the students at Oxford Conservatives so strong that last week, a group of students demanded the same protection of their rights, such as the one that is provided with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives of the student club of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge claim that their "often actively isolate was subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwelcome" because of their political views.
They want to put to the Committee on Equal Rights additional college representative to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only worsened recently released by the BBC 2 documentary about the policy in the student environment "Wonderland : young, smart and right," in which conservatives and neo-Nazis presented eccentrics.
The film was featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who drives a Rolls Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with a silver knob.
At other universities, students, conservatives complain that they make of "scapegoats because of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, a 20 years old, vice- president of the Conservative Association at Nottingham University, in an interview with a Sunday newspaper said that " in the university environment is increased bias towards left-wing views.
The people who we do not even know in advance consider us arrogant impunity and unruly children of wealthy parents. "
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a student at the Faculty of History of Corpus Christi College, which had filed a petition for increased protection, calls such an atmosphere "uncomfortable" and Cherill Stephanie, 19 years old, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, said that the attitude of members of the student club to the holders of the center-right looks considerably worse.
"It is a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual debate, and just for the normal life of the members of the club," - she said.
The first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just a minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, a shy and timid girl of eighteen.
Oxford lihoradilo enabled rancor k konservativnoй parties.
The year before university vote stripped former student of Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree because of its budget cuts for higher education.
In this atmosphere, it would be uncomfortable even Stalinists.
In the early days of the week freshman when the students get to know each other and the teachers, the first time I felt that was waiting for me to come.
I did not know that teachers not only turned a blind eye to the persecution of conservative students, but also they will gladly take part in it.
Political issues - the miners' strike, the privatization of the government and opposition to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa - penetrated the wood-paneled walls audiences.
On my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century, the English, and I was not prepared for what followed it.
"Miss Uayett - said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt - please set the first paragraph."
The text was given to me with difficulty, I stammered.
Harry Pitt was very jaundiced man with a face like a cake.
"Tetcheristy fundamentally do not teach French, or they simply do not have enough brains?" - He asked.
The other students snickered.
I had tears in his eyes.
"I advise you to take the first few French lessons in your spare time if you are certainly not very busy spinning in society," - probryuzzhal Pitt.
I went back to my room completely miserable.
That night in college, I was sitting at lunch one, then someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second year student from the Department of English, who identified himself as a member of the University Conservative Association.
"I know who you are - he said amiably.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows :
over everyone who is suspected of being sympathetic to the Conservatives, will scoff.
I myself is not easy, but in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, because you will be more difficult.
Most freshmen conservatives pretend they are laborers. "
Later, at the local pub, I was trying to cowardly hypocrite.
I insisted on the fact that not agree with everything that says Margaret Thatcher.
The trick failed.
Freshman Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: " You are the daughter of fascist pig.
You're contagious. "
Other students took up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
" As conservatives have sex? - Asked one of them.
- They beat each other, right? "
I felt like, must have felt homosexuals to decriminalize in the sixties.
Will I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become the Labour and hide their true beliefs?
The coming three years, I began to seem hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college, did not hide his conservative views, was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only of belonging to the Conservatives, but also for the fact that he was an adviser to Margaret Thatcher 's foreign policy, and one of her speechwriters.
In college, he almost did not show up.
He despised him for his provincialism, pettiness and commitment to the Marxist- deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"Here you will not be happy," - he said to me.
I began to go to Oxford from his parents' house in London, trying to find shelter among relatives and friends of unbiased capital.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained why.
He did not believe me.
During his studies in the forties there were made any political views.
" But this is the best university in the world - he said plaintively.
- There is not able to, not only in the city of spiers dormant...
Even my friends, the Communists have always behaved impeccably. "
His watery eyes dimmed.
" Do not take hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You break my heart if you throw university. "
I was exhausted from constant trips to London and my emotional defense weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and recanted.
The following week, during the seminar, when another teacher stories seriously called me an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
In his heart burning with shame, I confessed that "I was brainwashed parents," and described them as "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
The final nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time he wrote every week for two columns for publications owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not leave, and five minutes later my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed a bag and sat on the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at eighteen one should not become the object of such anger and intimidation at school.
Those sad that it was Oxford, who not only produced fourteen prime ministers of the Tories, but to this day behind the undeserved reputation of the university, in which value equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino prefers elegance glory"
About "Valentino: The master of sewing," which opened this week in London, ABC interview with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen- Bornemitsa and other well-known clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, worthy to take the exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
Designer acknowledged this during the opening of "Valentino: The master of sewing," triumphant retrospective exhibition, which brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "home" for the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," - he says with his unique Italian touch.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character that - "il signor" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his big-name clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by rare and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, replete with personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats of Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie- Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social climbing: from humble tailor from Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international "elite."
Being in love with the royal court - that there's anything wrong with that.
"At least they do not extinguish their cigarette butts on your magnificent carpet, as do some great pop music star," - said the Baroness Fiona Thyssen- Bornemitsa.
In the 60's and 70's we were both living in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino - unmatched host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
"We are all very pleased to come to his chalet in Gstaad," - says the ex-wife "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarhos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance glory.
And despite that, he - the star.
Valeria Mazza, representing Valentino
Argentinian model Valeria Mazza recalls the charismatic designer.
One day we went to dinner at his home, it was after a fashion show at the Plaza de España in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy - the younger.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
"Each of the guests gave Valentino feel important and loved ones," - says "top model", whose work with the designer began in 1995 during Fashion Week in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because of its designs - these are real works of art," - she ends up.
parade pedigrees
Life Garavani - history does not obsessions and loves with full reciprocity.
He likes people with good education and high titles, and they love it.
One of the galleries Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters in length, which offers a role reversal : the visitor takes the place of the models and should defile the catwalk, contemplating the "spectators" of the dreams that shine from Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress, which has chosen Jacqueline Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the suit, which was used by Monica Vitti in "Night" or the coat of wool and leather, which belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this model of public blestal names such as Sybil Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette -Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia Habsburg.
Nati Abascal and fashion in 2006
Many of these clients said that the first Valentino - like a first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
These were the pants, shirt, "vest" and a jacket from the collection autumn -winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he did to me," - says Nati Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it for the rest of his femininity, for his great love for women because it highlights our beauty" - adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I love the colors he uses : they have a lot of light and they are "fit" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princessa zakonodatelьnica mode and Patricia Dzhovampaola special case d ' Arenberg tozhe not mozhet zabыtь pervый different, kogda odelasь on Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would be the age of reason, and in order to put on one of his evening dresses...
Finally came the hour in the late 90 's.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to put it on the feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a skirt with ruffles, "corsage" pleated neckline and strapless.
"It was a dream come true," - says the widow of Dr. Rodrigo " Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion - it's timeless," - explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d ' Arenberg keeps their holiday dresses by fashion designer with "extreme caution... because the dress - it's not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it."
"King" of fashion
The grand finale exhibition at Somerset House - wedding dress, Marie- Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pavlos of Greece in 1995
It took four months and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in silk ivory inlaid with pearls, twelve different kinds of lace, and train in four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the trade press, the dress is a milestone of high fashion end of the XX century, "the return of clients of high society."

The hardest profession in the world : the miners from Kawah - Idzhena
For four euros Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, vtaskivaya 70 kilograms of sulfur on top of a volcano on the steep rocky trails
There are people for whom they work - hell, while others are literally working in hell.
Among them Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners, who earn their living in the mining of sulfur, Kawah Ijen volcano, located on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto down to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur dioxide rising from the depths of the Earth, freezes on contact with the air.
Splitting off huge chunks of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach up to 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo baskets, baskets heaped on his shoulders and carries them up the steep rocky road.
To the summit of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, only 250 meters, but exhausted baggage handlers require more than 40 minutes to get up at a snail's pace, barely holding the balance and carefully feeling for the road, so as not to stumble and fall off a cliff.
They know that one wrong move could cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France, which fell a few years ago from the rocks Kawah - Idzhena.
Miners from Kawah - Idzhena earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur, which is extracted
Once at the top, they find their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from the circus and tired carrying heavy baskets, stepping up to three miles of weights that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is about PT Ngrimbi Kandy, the company that operates since 1960 this volcano and it is better not to tell their employees that they pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents), petrochemical plants, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, and even dynamite to bleach sugar.
"As is the norm carrying 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each best-selling" - explains us Anto, who usually performs three daily carrying.
He spends three hours on each of them and in the end feels overwhelmed, but they allow it to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
While this seems minuscule for such an inhuman effort is three times more than what he would have earned in the field.
"Daily wage miners is very high by local standards, where a collection of coffee are paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is equal to two million rupees (167 euros)," - explains the porter, who had previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the site was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family in Banyuwangi, a town not far from the volcano, for good reason, which in Indonesia is as devastating as sulfur : "I married a girl from Bali, where some Hindus, and brought it to Java, so she converted to Islam."
We Anto asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughing, and he watery eyes due to toxic gases
At 27, Anto spent three years at the risk of an in - Kawah Ijen, sulfur which has already started to affect him in spite of the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, coughing constantly, and he has watery eyes due to toxic gases, which highlights the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of their dreams.
"I Work for two more years, because I want to open a shop or learn French or Spanish," - he promises more than acceptable English.
Punished life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or a clerk at the hotel, but instead it does the work mule.
Dividing the dirty wooden hut with the other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning, because sulfur does not cease to flow at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns to blue and shines amid the gloom.
Challenging the shadows, Anto down into the crater, lighting his way a little lantern attached to his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters dragged baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company is not mechanized mining sulfur in order to save costs and do not provide any equipment porters who work at their own expense and with such deprivation.
In fact, they do not get even a part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euro) fee for the photo shoot, which, along with the entry ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of the reserve charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its people - mules.
"This work for the cattle, and not for the people," - said Badrusin, chunky porter 42, who spent at Kawah Ijen - three decades, ever since I left college.
Able to lift up to 110 pounds, he makes sure that the work will suffer "as much as it can" because he needed money for the education of their three children, aged 18 to 10 years.
Do not retire, die here, because the volcano - this is my life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burning eyes when the wind suddenly changed and catches the miners in the dense columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains about his serious illness... more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthritis, knee pain and sores on their shoulders, which are deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing a basket on her back, now only Unaynik can lift 50 pounds in their 53.
Every day, he and his comrades take out 15 tons of sulfur from a volcano that three trucks transported to a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming the distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the bushes.
"Do not retire, die here, because the volcano - this is my life" - says Unaynik wide open mouth, which is missing a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, aged 30, also works sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetuates poverty from one generation to one of the most difficult things to do in the world : whatever it is that human mules with Kawah - Idzhena.

Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blamed career, stress, and housing prices and the lack of education of children.
"The population of Singapore to grow."
I am a patriot, husband, you are my wife patriot, fulfill our civic duty and create a life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising peppermint patties, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of rap which uses local sayings like, "Let's put bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
Advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this issue in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to people fulfilled "its national debt."
This thing is only for the web, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is a major problem in the country.
We are the world's worst for the reproduction of their own kind, so we felt that this is an issue that we need to touch.
We knew that the government was trying to do many things, such as to launch a perfume with pheromones or organized parties DatingCity (blitz - dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why do not we make the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose rap?
1.2 children
Who does not see it so lightly, this is the government of Singapore.
It spends 1,300 dollars a year for a policy to inspire the citizens in the birth of more children.
The State's interest for married couples and parents providing up to$ 15,000 per child, extending maternity leave and provide tax relief.
But all this has a low efficiency.
Singapore - this rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known conservatism of his leadership and his strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national management in terms of population, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
Last time it was below 2 - what is known as a percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why Singaporeans do not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Division of Policy for couples and families of the National Office of the population, says the reason for that "better education" and "a wide range of career opportunities."
"It allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to weddings and starting a family," - she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the growth of the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in decreased fertility in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which is aimed at a sharp increase in immigration to counter population decline, causing resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that thrives barely concealed xenophobia in many of the new immigrants, especially the Chinese, which has been criticized for keeping wages low and unwillingness to integrate.
Increased immigration is also regarded as one of the reasons that last year, the ruling party of Singapore received the worst result of the elections since independence.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve a problem with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
unexpected consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has some influence on the nation's economic growth, tax revenues, spending on health care and immigration policy, an example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to not built as a small housing.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
Manual for Urban Development transferred to the control of the number of small flats, known as the " shoe box 'that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are 46 square meters sold very well.
However, it is believed that they can facilitate the idle lifestyle and deprived of the stimulus developers who want to build a great family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of the homebuilding company EL Developers, says that their "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the large specimens.
They are more popular in the sense that these apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than the larger apartments.
As a result, our cash flows are increasing.
However, he acknowledged that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, which previously put obstacles if they want to offer too many small apartments in the project.
too strained
Singapore - a city -state.
While these new rules could be a step in the direction of increasing the national birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district center, it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are very overstretched, expensive housing, as well as education, and because of this, many people are postponing it," - says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
"But for me it is important to have your own money and time," - said another young man 20 years of age.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and the price of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as the government had not sought to encourage its citizens to have more children, in regard to procreation, the last word belongs to Singaporeans.

Offline Private - private online
Privacy Policy.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish language, we are talking about private property or "private sphere, which have the right to defend against any interference."
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16 years?
As he applies this definition in their daily lives and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers faced when discussing the Internet situations, which certainly will not be shared outside of the internet?
elPeriódico has interviewed five boys from ten to 15 years, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associate the term with "something very mine" in his personal plane, and "password and user name" when applied it to social networks.
"My biggest secrets I have not uploaded in the post," - says Jorge decade, when trying to explain the importance of personal sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"This is a very sensitive secrets, my mom might know them, but not the whole world," - he said.
On FB I load pretty pictures or images of games.
Also, I'm having fun with their friends.
"I would not have shared a photo that is not mine, or someone who behaves stupidly," - he said.
The boy realizes that bad publish indecent photographs of naked people, crimes or write abusive or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends who were with him in FB, and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are related.
Mother in the course, she has the password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter, to express themselves and write interesting tweets.
"I do not know whether to answer me, I just upload them" - he adds.
"Social networks - entertainment, I can talk with distant relatives or with your friends in a hurry," - he says.
Without hesitation, replied that he never would have accepted a request from an unknown person.
I would not be with someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14 -year-old Jose difference.
This teen has opened accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he knows 20 people added to his friends list.
"It does not scare me, because we have something in common, music, for example," - he says.
According to the boy, no it has not rubbed into the trust and did not ask for his home address or telephone number.
"If I will put pressure or demand, just remove them from your account," - he admits.
Ask Jose became a follower after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is today known as kibermobbing.
A friend of my girlfriend blackmailed into social networking.
He was threatened and extorted money.
"He never did find out who it was," - he assures.
The victim, according to Jose, do not delete the account.
"Just turned on confidentiality."
Then he explains the sequence of steps to set up an account in a safe manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would load photos acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if people do not like me, or if I want to.
"Although I know it's kibermobbing" - confirms it.
Key Issues
Marelos Porras, a teacher of English and an expert on education and training, said that in order to guide the children and young people need to understand that the purpose of social networking - to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites have changed the rules of the game", - she said.
Porras indicates that academic Marc Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Labor Digital natives and immigrants, these terms are invented to explain this phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
"We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning themselves," - she said.
Explains that this issue is complex, "because we ask them to have certain criteria that may or may not distribute, publish or say in an age when maturity is not enough for that."
"It is also to be selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends, regardless of the consequences," - she added.
According to him, the most effective way to show that such confidentiality for children and adolescents - to ask questions that make them reflect.
"Talking to them that they did not do it, it is useless," - she added.
Porras then lists some of the options : there are things that you would not tell a stranger, so why do you do it online?
Or, would you like it if you posted a photo like the one you posted about my friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you sign party photos, ask permission if you have other people to mark them?
And another thing, all you need to know what you're doing at every moment?
One more point - is to make them understand that they need to behave online as well as doing it offline.
Rules are the same.
"Beyond the Internet a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles should be the same in social networks," - she said.
vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, professor of elementary education and educational consultant, explains the need for the heads of the families conscientiously read the policy of social networks.
Understanding each of the items they have good reasons for talking to children about the premises of opening an account online.
"For example, the age and the fact that it is permissible to distribute or publish," - he said.
According Gaurdiya, the key question - to remind the children a lesson, "Do not speak to strangers."

VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Declaration of Lima, the previously announced and theoretically signed binding family members.
Efe has repeatedly tried to get access to the document signed at the next meeting of the VI Summit of the UNASUR, but sources from the Office of the Presidential Administration, and pointed to the main page that it will transfer after closing, but later confirmed that at some point it will be published on the web site of the Peruvian government.
Questions about the text, they indicated that the contents were described by President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the Summit was always limited.
During the day, was broadcast only in the press room, the video without sound presidential Assembly with "closed session, the sound is not allowed."
What information is circulated among reporters was assigned spokespersons of some governments UNASUR present at the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document prevalent during the day, there was a list of participating presidents, which angered the hundreds of journalists from different national and international media who have requested more information.
Subsequently, the administration of President of Peru sent an email to the media, "the final declaration" of the summit, but it is a statement of Humala, not an official document, which concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted III Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and at that time, despite the fact that this insistence of the press, too, has not been published so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA can verify that the document was published last Tuesday.

"We will follow and implement a solution that will explain the differences that we are now present in this international court," - said Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes, covenants and international tribunals," - said Pinera, and greeted with a handshake on the background of Humala flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the International Court occurred immediately after the Columbia protested this week Pact of Bogotá, under which it recognized the subordination of the verdict of the International Court following the decision of the maritime boundary with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in the UNASUR was suspended in 2011 after his impeachment of former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Receiving the President, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for the opening of discussions in the morning and for the closure of the summit, a little past noon on the Lima time.
The Head of State read the final document, which reported that 16 agreements have been adopted and approved by direction of the 31 projects of the South American countries, the amount of prospective investments totaled$ 17 billion.
Among the agreements, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries take "important steps toward the goal of South American citizenship, for which we extend the agreement on the place of residence."
He said that action is taken to improve the "co-operation in the fight against insecurity of citizens and against Transnational Organized Crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America, and taking into account the cumulative and effective manner of risks of natural disasters."
As Europe is in crisis, "the economic union (Latin America) should have no triumfatorskoy basis, and should serve to expand our manufacturing base and anticipate a better future for our cities," added Humala.
"We decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve communication spaces in South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our country and creating new economic schemes," - said the president of the Peruvian in the message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that the five belong to Peru, and limited transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two are aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
Also affected the outcome of the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country it will re- join the Union of South American Nations," from which it is now excluded.
The need to Latin America remained well-being of the region and the world, would be united, and had good relations between neighbors, was a different theme, emphasized by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for talks in a respectful form of the maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of the international Court contested Bogota.
"The Day After Tomorrow (Saturday), may meet with President Daniel Ortega," - said Santos.

"South America should learn from Europe in the integration of citizenship" : Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, has confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal, in which "South America, in which case, yes, should learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, Peru, told state television that the Europeans "were killing each other during World War II" and other collisions, "but now they're practically the fatherland."
He defended, in this context, the project is the establishment of a South American citizenship, which favor the member countries of UNASUR.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors who want to return us to the past" - he warned.
Ecuadorian president showed himself, in addition, a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS), under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those who signed the Pact of San Jose on Human Rights.
Those who lectures, never assume no obligation, and we, the South Americans, by contrast, are signing it.
"It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington and is funded by the United States," - he said, alluding to the political asylum given by Ecuador WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he does not regret the decision, because what happened to him, he did not betray his principles, and comply with its "deepest values of democracy and human rights."
He added that in his time "had some suspicions that Assange will be extradited to a third country and will not be honored process."
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to come into its territory for questioning about alleged sex crimes, while the "self Swedish law considers it possible to implement it by video, which can be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration of physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious," - said the head of the Ecuadorian state.
What really is, so is the risk of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do the exercises in the air.
"It affects the health of any individual," - he added.
Correa said that the solution to the problem of asylum granted Assange in June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, by providing guarantees of immunity, which will allow him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts, and stressed that the talks were in London about searching address the imprisonment of the founder WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate about human rights, the word in this case we do not use, but there were constant discussions.
"The solution is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European courts because Assange's lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, is a series of processes in the various European institutions," - he mentioned.
And expressed the opinion that "if the UK tomorrow will provide a guarantee of immunity, this is over."
While in Sweden, as it allows her perfectly legislation and how it has done in other cases, interrogate Assange lady at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogate him on Skype, tomorrow, this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and said he did not tolerate "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort the freedom of expression."
"The main enemies of press freedom is not spoiled by the villains policy, and bad journalists, supporting the bait, blackmail and extortion," - he said.
In this aspect, he was satisfied that these are not journalists, "neither the bankers nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries do not prevail in Ecuador," and added that, being re-elected, "will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to retain a veto Paraguay UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and do not tolerate opportunism and supporting coups under the guise of legality," because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
Ecuadorian president found, in addition, "totally justified" his desire Colombian colleague Juan Manuel Santos' lead is now in talks with Nicaragua's maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice, The Hague, which was in favor of the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment the decision is not enforced.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
Need to process them together to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed his hope for a good end to the dispute on maritime borders, which are in the same court in Peru and Chile, and has stated that "the right to Latin America to appeal to international court if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be".
Regarding the opportunity to speak as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that it is considering this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even though sometimes it's pretty hard."
Correa assured that if he lost the election in February 2013, it will go out of public life.
On a personal note, I was never interested in power, but in such unjust situations, such as in Ecuador, socio- economic poverty can only be rectified by the political power.
"My political movement felt that it was I who ensured that the probability of winning, so I have to accept this responsibility," - he said.
In case of victory, it would be my last term in office, and then we get out of public life.
If you lose, the same thing.
"This decision," - he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he went to a treatment that has already been planned, routine, and it is expected that he will miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean worsening state of health of President Chavez," - he explained.
The head of the Ecuadorian state took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.

Deaths from AIDS today - the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test was positive.
"I was stunned as if" - he recalls that difficult, despite all the tact a doctor now.
The boy hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease himself, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were met - he celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrice - one of the "oldest" of HIV- patients of the hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He is living with a diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90's in it would be hard to believe - too few treatment options exist then, too little is known about the disease, too discriminated against patients.
Thus, even the director of the clinic, Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he was cut."
In other words, at the time the sentence was to have AIDS.
It is now possible to survive in this syndrome, and to do so without compromising the quality of life.
However, unaware of their disease until now, many people are coming, when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
Later in '31 after the advent of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of patients who start treatment in a timely manner, and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," - said the head of the department of HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, referring to the fact that this information was confirmed in April of this year in the prestigious scientific journal.
Infectious disease specialist and an expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008, scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system in the patient at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best expectancy lives of those who do not use drugs : up to 30 years with the number 200 CD4, and up to 50 years when the reported 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that the one who gets diagnosed HIV - positive at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, "maintaining control, be able to live without any problems up to 75 years," - he explained.
To evaluate this progress, we should remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today the average is 76 years.
Although the mortality rate has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Annual Report), it is also true that with the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been registered by May of this year, however, argues that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs in 2005.
- Why there are still deaths?
- Personally, I think that the problem of access to treatment.
So I imagine it's because things are in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years, we have had no shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come too late, because they do not know their infected status, that is, in the later stages of the disease.
He led the crushing data: "Nine out of ten patients come when some already have an opportunistic infection, you need to do to have a greater impact on overall mortality, as it is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for the detection of mass scale, for all the people who ask it."
In its proposal, agree experts and officials of the State Council on AIDS prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who asked for the check to a private lab, impelled only by the fact that it is made by his friend and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi 's sarcoma, a cancer which is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some people think that they will die, and did not want to know.
"If going to die, I'd rather get drunk three times a week," - they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he is a cancer survivor.
I live a normal life like any other.
"I'm working, I have a lot of classes, I travel, I conduct an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, taking care of yourself and the other person" - listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their personal lives with MILENIO JALISCO, to coerce his statement as who now, in the context of the World AIDS Day, experiences fear.
Let us check if there was a risk of infection, even as soon as possible to know whether they are HIV- positive or better, and if they already have a diagnosis, and let them know that they can live like any other human being responsible.
This sums up the theme of his message against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Large gap between health programs and common citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, which addressed the problem of HIV-related.
And the greatest is prevention.
In areas devoted to this task, "actually increased condom distribution, before we were given one or two, and now we give a hundred packages, and it's very good, but it turns out that there are those who are now still do not have access to condom,"- he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do they tell you?" is a popular question with malice and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and health care workers who do not want to hear teenagers assured propagandist.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution, that condoms were not only behind the counter, and that hundreds of them were in vending machines in public toilets in places that are often visited by young people.
This does not encourage promiscuity.
This is not a payment of beer and motel Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked whether it is possible distribution of condoms under his leadership.
"It's not sexy, it's best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity", - he said.
Key data in Jalisco
Registered 13,435 total cases (1,317 and 12,158 AIDS -HIV).
State ranks 4th place in the national ranking of new and total cases of AIDS and the 13th of HIV.
92% of infections related to sexual way, 6% through the blood, and 2% to perinatal way.
An estimated 50,000 people are living with HIV, as there is one documented case is 4 to 5 people who do not know it.

Given the ratification of the United States Court of Appeals decision, which cancels the debt restructuring of the Group Vitro, achieved through bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, the script sets the fatal precedent for any national company with offices in the neighboring country, which has a solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures to support the survival of firms that are Allowed Mexican law, are not valid in the country bands and stars in conflict with international agreements.
In the practical sphere, the approval decision rendered on June 15 Judge Harlin Hale in the court of the Northern District of Texas bankruptcy, leaving defenseless Mexican firms face possible seizure of their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.

There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts guaranteed by the federal institute bankruptcy proceedings.
It is also true that subtracting voices branches, one way or another creditor Vitro, who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely funds "vultures" like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote was 45 to 37 percent against.
This data puts the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro in a difficult situation with which she has faced since 2008, affected by a severe economic crisis that has overtaken the United States, attacking the country.
So far, the family firm produces Gonzalez Sada appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself to vote came to his plenum, that is, the five judges, in view of the fact that they voted only three.
In case of failure will be presented to an application for the certificate, which will require a review of the process by a higher court, in this case, the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the Court rejected the document sent to the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), which describes a process that should Vitro under the Law on bankruptcy proceedings, signaling that it exempts itself from compliance with the agreements signed by the two countries in order to link it with article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy.
In addition, it is noted that the country is governed by the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for interstate cases of insolvency, which guarantees equal rights for debtors and creditors.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes : "Basketball was my life"
An avid traveler basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years is associated with the sport, and thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico stores in memory so much basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it before brain hemorrhage confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years as a player of small categories, Team Supreme Basketball League commissioner and head of BSN from Bayamon Cowboys and the president of the Basketball Federation.
"I have performed many roles in basketball during his lifetime, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, CEO and President of the National Federation of the team in the 90s" - says Reyes during a visit to Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife, for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes was not exaggerating, making this assertion.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected over his long way to show this.
Bayamon heart
With the greatest emotions he keeps those that remember his way through the Cowboys since the mid 50's as a player until 1982, when the 15th anniversary of his speech as co - agent or contract.
" They were my best years, I have enjoyed the most, because he had the opportunity to be part of the eight championships with the Cowboys in 1967 as an agent with the agent or supervisor.
There were many years of joy, including five championships, held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to the one in 1981, the year of the debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
Since then, and continue to lead became "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, "- said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who was heading here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham) told me : "I got you a very good player, the growth of 6'7".
"Would you?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who have been at Puerto Rico.
Bartov then recommend a sniper Raymond Gauss, who became a citizen and has become one of our top scorers.
I remember that I said that if I brought the championship Mincy Bayamon, Gauss would help to win another one.
Cowboys in the championship Gauss I enjoyed, but at a distance, because by 1988 already was listed head of the federation.
By the time I preferred to enjoy his accomplishments and achievements Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won for the first time in the U.S. during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we got fourth place and it had to be bronze, if not for the Canadian judge who made us replay the final game, Reyes said.
The team from the World Cup in 1990 - this is the best team as the one you 've ever seen?
She is among the best, just like the one that defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was the one with the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and broke the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that we have won the bronze medal at the World Championships.
In the team not only played again Mincy, Gaussian, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and ' Pikulina ' (Ortiz), but also young (Javier) ' Tonito ' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario ' Quijote ' Morales, who was unable to participate in '90 due to a knee injury.
The team, which was probably not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and a great joy, there was a team Olympic qualifying tournament in 1995 in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role- players like ' Kanito ' Nieves, Pablo Alisea and Rolando Hurruitnera young players in return, temporarily suspended for the mess in the Pan American Championships in Mar del Plata, we won the gold against all expectations.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was a Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico did not dominate at this level as it did Pikulin.
And that's not counting his career in various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good youngsters, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From young, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in the BSN had up to 17 teams of the season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce played only in the area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it's unnecessary.
At least, I can see the fruits of mandatory certification and courses for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and sometimes I go to basketball games.
And, of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel that has always been with me.

Begins a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore the apocalyptic events, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, the professor of religion Stewart Sharma decided to read the course of the end of the world, he knew that he possessed an irresistible lure : the end of the "long count down" the Mayan calendar, December 21, for which many people have seized as evidence that the coming end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months : Catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis, which some call "dolgoarmageddonom" and the growing conflict, which dragged Israel, a place where the Christian end times theorists believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I did not realize that this would be the apocalyptic semester of all" - said Sharma this week, students at Rutgers University - Camden (NJ).
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the moment, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good time.
And remember that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor who offers courses on "doomsday" this semester, in theory, the latter in history.
At Temple University Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes, such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are spread over time," - he said, and the way the offer hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human behavior.
If the nuclear material will fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed the films apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real world examples.
"I tried to tell the students about what is possible, probable, probable and possible" - said Wacker.
The main campus of the University of Pennsylvania professor of Latin American history by Matthew Restall and Amara Solari his colleague, associate professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to read the course, which is simply called "The End of the World".
"We do not add '2012 'to always be able to read the course again, if the end of the world will not come," - said Restall.
Despite the "inevitable destruction," students need to learn, prepare projects and to take final exams.
At Penn State final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work "until that night, which supposedly come to an end," said Restall.
Courses were quite popular.
"Places ran for two hours," - said Restall its course for students with a high GPA, which enrolled 35 students.
We have received e-mails for weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there is still space.
Students, in turn, assured that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people do to comfort himself," - said Brigid Robinson, a 23 -year-old student of the separation of religion and sociology of Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers - Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Vekesa, 25 -year-old student of psychology and nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
"I've never heard of a course that would teach this," - he said.
I love it.
But none of the students surveyed - not to mention the professor - did not say that he believes in the doomsday date of December 21.
"Our first project addressed the Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we have discredited him," - said Julie Zeglen, 21 -year-old student of the final year at Temple University in West Chester.
Mayans never predicted the end of the world, it is simply a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he noted that there was an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries in which people react to changes around him, predicting the end of the world.
Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
"In other places, people do not think about it," - he said.
Mainly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Doherty, a professor of religion, University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to a question about whether he knew about some informed about the "end of the world" out there.
"The Philippines did not participate in the end of the world" - he wrote, referring to an order by a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that for a long time talked about the many days of final judgment, and said that if nothing is going to happen on December 21, "people immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophize, that December 21 is the start of a seven-year period, after that the world will end.
Students and teachers blithely refer to this date.
Some said they were going to go to a party, "end of the world."
"Maybe someone will call from friends to laugh together," - commented Samir Ford, 20 -year-old student of communication.
