A Republican strategy to counter the d' Obama reelection
Republican leaders condoned their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United-States that the number of people killed by lightning.
D' elsewhere, lawyers Republicans n' identified that 300 cases of electoral fraud to United States-in ten years.
One thing is certain: These new provisions will affect adversely the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for l' federal elections Member-States.
In this spirit C' qu' a majority of US governments passed from 2009 new legislation making it more difficult the process d' registration or voting.
This phenomenon has taken l' scale after elections in November 2010, which saw s' add 675 new representatives Republicans in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 projects of laws restricting l' exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require voters to cast a card d' photo ID and proof of citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce periods of advance polls, invalidate the right to s' register as a voter on polling day and remove the citizens with a criminal file their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no State voters n' required to submit a photo identification card d'.
Indiana L' was the first State to ask such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008-upheld the constitutionality of the law of l' Indiana.
The authorities by republican s' d' extend this practice d' other States.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo identification card d'.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity card d' as the l' health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, lack of cards d' photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
Furthermore, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a d' d' identity.
However, it is often more than one hundred dollars to obtain the identity card d' required.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low income persons.
Indeed, 25% of afro-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of people over the age of 65 and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years do not possess the required d' identity card with photo.
Much more.
Students, considered more voters voted for other democratic candidates are not permitted in several States to use their card d' photo ID issued by their institution.
However, these same States permit members clubs fishing or hunting who vote more on the Republican side d' use for voting cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State n' required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona L' was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen d' states have enacted laws requiring electors to prove qu' they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two Hispanic voters on three promote the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, Republican legislators sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing l' registration of voters on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors seeking s' register.
These restrictions are not inconsequential.
For example, when l' 2004 general election campaigns d' voter registration helped save approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 has reduced the rate of 17% d' registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states to reduce the period of polls.
For example, when l' 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of electors who voted in advance were afro-Americans, while they accounted for only 13% of the voters of l' State.
It was the same with Hispanics.
Ceux-ci accounted for 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who were 76% of voters accounted for 46% of electors voting in advance.
Of course the Democratic lawmakers and their supporters objected vigorously to l' adoption of laws restricting l' voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of Governors democrats.
L' Advocate General of United States-intervened to suspend the laws the most controversial.
They were able to limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of 34 States have enacted laws requiring the submission d' d' identity card with photo.
Nevertheless, the new rules implemented will undoubtedly make it more difficult l' exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Critics Democrats denounce the partisan nature of laws that have been enacted and they see a clear objective d' influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A report by the Brennan Centre 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 election.
But one thing is certain: These new provisions will affect adversely the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will undermine the democratic system.

Prostate cancer screening: Pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA test d' would sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, causing unnecessary medical interventions.
What do hesitate even more men already reluctant to pass tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked l' Notice of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United-States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, it is therefore difficult d' interpret these data and d' have firm recommendations.
Another study, the then-European concluded a difference of mortality among patients who had a screening n' and those who have not.
This study also showed, with a followed after 12 years, was qu' between 30 and 40% more likely d' have metastasis n' if it is not detected.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if it has a direct parent who has already had a prostate cancer.
Men d' afro American-origin are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once qu' detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and other d' are feeble.
We really need to understand the patient the degree of risk of the cancer, by offering options, by not addressing necessarily prostate cancer who do not affect life in the long term, and opting instead, in these cases ,-for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many d' Aujourd' men showing cancer will not be processed, because their cancer n' is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We suggest to make active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we will offer treatment.
Increasingly, with accuracy criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend to pass the test.
But important d' l' is having a discussion with her physician to determine if you should spend or not.
In collaboration with the International Society d' urology, Movember has created a tool that allows d' evaluating the pros and cons of d' PSA test.

Prevent illness
He n' unfortunately no easy way to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, l' adoption of lifestyle remains the best way to reduce risks d' suffer.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, it could prevent 30% of cancers.
"If nobody smokes, this rate was at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, door-word of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, assessing qu' approximately 10% of cancers are caused by l' inheritance.
Several also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
The cigarette is linked to 85% of all cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This was detrimental to the health of people.
"Still aujourd' today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", deplores the door-floor André Beaulieu.
Encouraging l': 10 years after quitting, your risk of dying cancer d' fall by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity l' L' also promote l' onset of illness, according to the CSC.
They increase the risk of breast cancer, colon and rectum, l' oesophagus, pancreas and l' uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity l' during a lifetime protects against colon cancer," adds-Engine and thus.
L' diet
L' organization also recommends to reduce consumption of red meat.
Too much of it raised the risk d' be achieved d' colorectal cancer.
Meats, and should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage cells of l' organization and lead to the development of cancer," explains-Engine and thus.
Vitamins
In recent years, scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, are not conclusive for l' moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While a l' d' they noted a reduction in risk of prostate cancer, another noted rather an increase.
L' effect of vitamin D on cancer n' is unclear.
Furthermore, Mr. Beaulieu stressed l' importance to discuss her concerns and his family history with their physician.
"Being tested, it does not cancer."

The Higgs boson scrutinized
Probable L' announced the discovery of the Higgs boson has created quite a stir, l' last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of anything in l' universe, no less.
And then there are the last s' l' particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "bad" explanation of the nature and the behaviour of the material - but n' has still not been observed empirically.
But for physicists, he is n' allé qu' whether he s' the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that shadow l' d' l' taking genuine new particle, and qu' it resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new findings this week at a major conference d' physics, Kyoto, seem to confirm, but there is still a lack of data to be perfectly.
Suppose all the same it s' qu' whether the Higgs, since the chances seem to be thin, and see what it is s'.
There is, in this world, a law inevitably unavoidable that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
No way d' violating this rule - and n' not try too hard, you will hurt.
However, even if particle physics is a strange world, it is s' qu' she, too, a law like this: The Pauli exclusion principle d', which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" of roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists rank particles into two categories.
In a corner, there are good citizens appointed fermions, whom wisely the Pauli principle.
And in another l' s' wag bosons, a dirty Gaza d' n' anarchists who have respect for nothing — at least, not for this principle, which means qu' they may well find themselves in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then broke into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, d' elsewhere) The Particle Adventure, Berkeley Laboratories: The mesons, which we n' will not here, and the particles "force", by which the major forces of nature spread and that the Higgs boson is somehow related.
These bosons-there, it should be emphasised here are not all bugs also exotic qu' you might think.
In fact, if you read this column, c' is through a boson d' an extraordinary banality: The photon, or "particle of light" which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electrical charge accelerates or changes of direction, this "disturbing" the electromagnetic field in this exact spot, a bit like a stone thrown in a pond.
This "disturbance" born an electromagnetic wave (light, or l' or l' infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this is another wave n' d' qu' a photon - and therefore, a boson "bearers of strength."
Field more stable
The same applies with the Higgs boson, with the difference that c' is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson appears.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; for l' excite, we must achieve very, very high energies, a bit like s' s' d' it was a frozen pond which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
C' must therefore be a huge particle accelerator - such as the CERN Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27km circumference! - to achieve such energies.
L' analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
These are not all particles, or all materials, interacting with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but other d' not - a piece of paper, for example, will never him-even on a fridge.
And in the same way, these are not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: Those who do have a mass, while others (like the photon) n' have not.
Now, qu' is-what "can provide" all this research, asked Ms. Plamondon?
For science, it serves to check the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and this also allows physicians to scrutinize any discrepancies between observations and MS predictions.
They are also d' several who earnestly hoped qu' found, because the slightest difference could open a door on a new "physical" some holes and cap the Model.
Celui-ci, it must be said, still has huge d' shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or the dark matter, which trains about 80% of the Universe l' (re-oops!).
But it has not found n' such deviations at CERN jusqu' to now.
Impact
The implications of this research in the everyday life of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume he qu' n' will not.
Note: In the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser, in Bell Laboratories, unaware of the revolution that their work would trigger.
They saw scientific applications, but the rest.
In fact, we have already said fire physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and was well-developed the first laser (the first), pulsed in 1962 - initially the laser was viewed as a "gadget lab."
Imagine...
And then applications can also come from any l' instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle has developed a light sensor in 1969, during its work in optics.
This detector, although this n' was not at all its original intent, Now '"eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and won the 2009 Nobel physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will transform our lives, but this means that, really, you never know...

Palliative Care - The best way to die... | Le Devoir
With his Commission die with dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly so qu' a bill prepares.
However, in this crucial area, much remains to be done.
Le Devoir tried d' closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in her apartment in the Montérégie region.
Prostate cancer who gnawed left him with a break of two years.
"They m' gave five years to live, j' have seven years," said-it-figue, half-grape, lying in bed at home palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where it happened the day before.
"But c' is still a shock, we cannot be prepared for it," said-it.
The disease is his work: A weakness which prevents l' to travel to the washroom, and even eating alone.
Attablé before a delicious lunch, he will be helping to eat, resigned.
Courageous, they sometimes smile, talk to strangers are s' around him, brought him his medication, offer him a bath.
The courage to death.
"My greatest hope, is c' qu' I heal diarrhea, c' is demeaning," says-.
A few hours later, the "team has found a cure for this evil.
"During our lives, you learn qu' a man, piss standing," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at home Victor-Gadbois.
Decline in l' child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person" to accept regression-notes.
Because l' Notice of several people involved in palliative care, moments take place at the heart of this regression.
Patients who come to the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this stage, the "team of doctors and nurses d' around them does not provide more care expressed" therapeutic ".
Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled".
But the disease m' did discover my children.
"J' have good-children," she adds.
"I have more n' wishes in life," said-she before d' accept qu' he is a mask for l' help breathing.
It is still, in the coming days, a last visit of his son come d' Italy.
Victor-Gadbois, scene, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps l' l' diet.
These are the palliative care, given that l' when he n' d' has nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, a bed of palliative care for 11 700 inhabitants.
C' is little known qu' when they are all dead.
Here, life goes on in the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, a l' doctors of the house.
Whether in the physical, emotional and spiritual comfort.
The dying, it will provide care to mouth the brandy or Pepsi, depending on demand.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, c' is his son to complete the beer at the foot of the deceased.
"It helps families as patients," said Nathalie Savard, Director of care.
Home Victor-Gadbois, the days follow but do not look alike.
Alongside a d' 93 years old man who savours his last family assembly in the yard, well cushioned in pillows and qu' it is falling in his honour, a young man of 36 years died tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children, after having tried everything possible to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds are occupied by cancer patients aged under 45 years s' concerned," Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the house Victor-Gadbois come from their homes, 47 per cent of l' hospital.
Problem d' access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians n' simply have no access to palliative care, including c' is-care designed to alleviate the suffering lorsqu' a patient reached the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, l' hospital or in home care.
And several agencies, as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal specialize more or less exclusively in care for cancer patients.
C' is precisely this great gap in health care in Quebec has several doctors specializing in palliative care l' adoption d' legislation governing l' euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October d', a manifesto, signed luminaries of palliative care including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to show their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system n' is not good enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before l' accepted to l' euthanasia.
Recently, said-she, j' saw a patient spend 14 days l' emergency in great pain, without qu' we do the necessary to relieve.
I fear that patients are dying because qu' they do not receive adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists s' jusqu' stalking their patients at the last day, despite the worst predictions.
The hopes of survival d' Hélène Richard were already minimal lorsqu' dropped chemotherapy.
When j' have told my oncologist that j' stopped treatment, she replied m' qu' she regretted that j' stop fight, she-said.
Yet she m' had said that I was finished! "
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who want to die thanked caregivers not acceding to their application after qu' they were relieved of their pain by a team of palliative care.
But we must say that palliative care are not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of palliative care at the Society of palliative home care of Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to treatment for pain in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors have often use palliative sedation, which amounts to lull the patient jusqu' at the time of his death, sporadically, permanently.
We cannot pretend not to hear this part-the suffering.
Increasingly, the patient not relieved will have the possibility to have this d' palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you m' euthanasiiez" means "I want to be relieved."
The achievement of this report has been made possible thanks to a Journalism Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials from roads, building contractors, fundraisers of political parties and the Italian Mafia tell day after day this qu' they know d' a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso.
A "industry" who dearly to Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"C' is curious as the system s' eroded since qu' we took major," good Jacques Duchesneau, member of Quebec and the former chief of police of Montreal.
C' is through him that the scandal has erupted in 2011, through d' an investigation on malpractice related to road construction contracts in Quebec, which Liberal Premier Jean Charest, time l' n' had consented qu' backwards.
The report "Duchesneau" established a direct link between industry, financial underpinnings of parties and corruption of public officials.
"Since the beginning of l' investigation in 2010, stresses-advantage, the only department of transport would be spared a billion in contracts, some" being their instincts to reach a quote-part!
The Commission Charbonneau "has already brought down two mayors," adds-it, hoping she qu' to demonstrate "schemes behind individuals."
A permanent unit against corruption, established in 2011
Permanent Unit L' corruption, created in 2011, s' addressed with his army of auditors, investigators and analysts from the government.
The police squad l' "Twilight" which, since 2009, led the cartel "sewer" from Montreal to apply the brake on the swelling contracts...
In recent weeks, she conducted searches in series and laid charges for fraud and corruption against municipal officials, as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor d' a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who comes to resign from his position of mayor of Laval, third city of Quebec.
It is suspected d' have pocketed pots-of-wine repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
Are formally charged furthermore engineers roads of Montreal and entrepreneurs d' Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino zambito.
The latter was feeling explaining to the Committee the mechanics of "system" d' win public contracts.
He even paid-for years 3% of the value of contracts awarded to Montréal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who reversait l' money to Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. zambito sowed all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He confessed also have organized a collection of illegal funds for l' ex-vice-premier, Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts d' sewers that inflated costs
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption functioned smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, ex-public works engineer, l' has detailed before the committee: In 10 years, he received d' construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and pots-of-wine totalling $736,000 in exchange for contracts d' sewers that inflated costs.
Other D' road officials said s' be done smear by 30% to 40% invoices, by false extras.
Then an organizer of the party of the mayor, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay d' deliberately ignored a budget parallel fuelling its coffers with l' dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montréal in a major crisis.
Chantal l' Rouleau was one of the first elected from Montreal to sound the alarm d'.
Mayor of l' district of Rivière-des-Prairies, l' is l' island s' from 2010, she rebelled against the sale d' municipal property purchased 5 million and resold... 1.6 million to developers, booming real estate.
70% d' dirty money in election campaigns
Investigation of l' will finally be put in place, she said she "qu' draws on a wire to understand how the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and apprehend culprits".
The process, said-she is painful but "positive".
One is to clean the wound but a unit d' investigation in Montreal and a watch, not to see back questionable practices.
As they cleaned.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau noted that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but s' mainly concerned the role of '"elected aware of the scheme", when they do not soaking in the politicking!
Considering to 70 per cent d' dirty money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, it is ironic: "We m' said it was n' qu' a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit to $100 donations but this will not change the situation, he said: "Both qu' will not strictly election expenses, there will be l' dirty money in politics."
It calls for an overhaul of the system d' granting of public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot go below; get to the bottom of things, with courage, will rebuild the house on a more solid footing, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes l' international image du Québec and Montréal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh watching in their own backyard.

"PSG is not n' FC Barcelona!"
This season, you took a new scale with the GMP.
How you explain-this progression?
You can explain l' awareness but also by the new dimension of the GMP.
Players arrived.
Every day, I continue to their side.
The technical staff m' has also contributed.
On a daily basis, these factors lead me to raise my level.
And in game, c' is easier.
Everything is very quickly in football.
But I do not ignited m'.
My debut at the centre of preformation of l' INF Clairefontaine during my visit to Saint-Etienne, j' have always put forward by levels.
You are therefore benefit from competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
Recruits this summer are used to play games of very high level.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What makes qu' a player like me wants to cope and to provide the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti m' brings a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is-he l' man of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti gain respect from all technicians.
It Aujourd' n' d' has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches.
He has extensive experience and won many titles with upscale clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he qu' wins d' other titles in Paris.
In January, comforting j' had a discussion with him.
I left then d' a series of injuries.
Confidence he qu' m' gives also explains my performance.
How do you wear-on the first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon we took the place of leader.
But we remain in ambush.
One of our key objectives is the Champions League: We have qualified for the semifinals with the way.
What is l' objective of the club in this competition?
We will try d' go as far as possible.
Now, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in very good European teams.
We want our first d' finish first, before Porto, to receive in the web.
PSG-it can become a great European club in the short term?
It has already the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and s' register in duration.
Aujourd' n', this is not the case.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this happen.
In Ligue 1, not win the title, as last season, would be a failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, it was really heart d' pocket this championship.
Last season, n' is not far away.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
It has been a very large season.
It ended with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we are supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, conducted a season more fantastic.
This year, I think c' is good.
Even if the big teams as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are competing for the title, I think qu' l' was arms to win.
Do you-media expect too much of the MTP?
C' is normal qu' much awaited us in view of what has been invested and players are qu' a.
We fully accept l'.
After lorsqu' win 4-0 at home against Troyes and qu' there are still things wrong c' is sure c' is a bit frustrating.
One wonders what people expect more.
You can never win 4-0 all week-ends.
It is not n' FC Barcelona!
We try to implement a project.
A team builds over time.
It was demonstrated in Champions League qu' could be present.
Look at Manchester City n' not happen, for two seasons, to qualify for the semifinals of the final, they have also made d' enormous expenses!
In view of the sums invested, you guessed d' with 15 points ahead to the truce!
C' was neglecting our adversaries and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not n' well last season, were "boostés" by this new GMP.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
J' hope qu' in May we can have a smile in telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we eventually l'.
PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much the better qu' characterization qu' there is a "Zlatan dependency."
This means qu' Ibrahimovic is very efficient and qu' he puts a lot of goals.
He came to it and it proves qu' it is the star of the Ligue 1.
He has demonstrated wherever it is past qu' he was a great player, a star.
Within the group, it respects l' man and the player.
He also respects the men he qu' around him.
This qu' he is truly exceptional.
It encourages others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is l' one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How have you lived l'-Euro 2012 with l' team of France?
As a disappointment.
J' had committed to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented m' to glean game time.
J' saw things là-bas and j' am strengthened.
, Aujourd' j' arrives to achieve good games in selection.
C' is what j' hoped since my baptism with the Blues.
It has learnt from what s' rose in Ukraine and aujourd' d' must now be exemplary.
How do you wear-on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of France?
He has the results for him.
It is well positioned in the group qualifier for the Mondial.
Breeders is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires win.
As l' was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make comparison.
White had achieved his goal by calling us for l' Euro.
J' hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil.
The good nil (1-1), 16 October, Spain is a founder-advantage?
This game has given us confidence.

With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite of monetary exchange, based on central banks of the transactions identified and processing costs between stakeholders.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: The belief that the current monetary system, bank monopolies, led to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a protocol d' secure exchange in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows l' file exchange.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have been recorded with 15 000 computers on the network.
A thousand Web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after having reached a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning aujourd' d', around a dozen dollars (courses are registered on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to the real world trade in currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) s' is interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin virtual currency as "the most successful," "in competition with the dollar or euro l'" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin stands out d' other types of virtual currency as the "credits", used for progress in a video game that l' in playing or l' you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But each time, a central authority and control trafficking trade.
Bitcoin, with all the nodes of the network are both depositaries of the book, auditors, issuers of currency, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network?
Each transaction between two users is actually between two addresses how d' an e-mail.
Except qu' a user can choose a different address for each payment, ensuring l' anonymity.
A whole d' information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a system of double encryption key.
The network can check l' authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the s' bitcoins exchanged exist in the book of Public Accounts, distributed throughout the network.
L' step-key is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution d' a mathematical challenge launched computers, and the winner, sort of central banker, will have the privilege d' add this line.
It is a phase d' s' hash file is c' d' including-processing a large file in a shorter and unique fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "chop" l' together.
The goal is to find the number who gives a particular stamp (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number found other knots check that c' is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructiblement linked to the chain of l' other transactions; any amendment would change l' imprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes), one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - l' other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprint.
Computer L' resolved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid l' inflation, this award is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible jusqu' the 100 millionth, leaving the room...
The difficulty of the challenge is also found in each computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and robbed in bitcoins deposits.
"The flaw used does not concern the protocol-even him," says Pierre Noizat, who recently launched Paymium, a payment in real money using the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also identifies opportunities for money laundering d' through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Serious players like Wikipedia denies donations of this nature.
Other D', such as flat-form of WordPress blog, acceptance.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, l' Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the book of accounts and shown that almost 80% of bitcoins not run.
In November, "giant" balances were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul bitcoins, which converts the gold.
Stone, Noizat author d' a book on this currency, believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a mobile contactless payments, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, returning and cheaper.
The holder manages its identity and can be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who need n' d' install new terminals or software.
It suffices to communicate an address qu' a phone can photograph "and", says Pierre Noizat having thousands d' users.
There is a general movement to subvert the hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin s' needed, but 2013 could be a turning point," predicted-it.
The ECB, in his report, provides d' elsewhere to reassess the casualty, aujourd' considered high, in case of success of this currency.

We started d' Afghanistan.
And after?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
L' NATO and Americans should follow end 2014.
It is time that l' Afghan army regain possession of its territory and that Afghans choose their future, without any expect of us.
These are mainly Afghan farmers that we have punished by treating them as terrorists.
And we, with our same-88 soldiers killed and wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban consist d' foreign extremists, former Heads d' refugees in Pakistan, but often farmers who refuse the foreign army, as the Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, old and outdated, even s' they were joined by jihadis, Pakistan, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by the local insurgents, ceux-ci will any more when Westerners will be more discreet.
The departure of the French troops of the basis of Nijrab, j' watched from the hills planted d' almond through French credits, s' l' is in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored joined Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no flood n' Taliban Kabul at the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible breakthrough from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was empty, the country aflame by struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was seen as a sort of liberation, a return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price of l' obscurantism of these farmers overwhelmed by l' organization d' Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved s' today.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban come together in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main leaders of the Soviet Army war returned to power in 2001.
They have calcified into business, taking up government land for resale in building land returnees d' Iran and Pakistan, with enormous "contracts under-American contracting.
They challenged; most d' n' d' them have not fought them-same.
People, as I have heard l' in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not formed of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, leave those who took advantage of American largesse: Capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They have worked with the modern world in their exile in Iran and Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population is under 25 years; Kabul are now d' 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full, girls as boys.
It will provide work for these young people to return to l' obscurantism of the old parties or corruption of rulers.
Everyone, including armed opponents, are fond of phones; television, and his Turkish soap operas with a modern world, is followed everywhere.
L' army is now present.
The authorities who will order will-they regarded as legitimate?
The former commanders of the Soviet Army are already struggle to reconstruct provincial militias that escape the central government.
L' Afghanistan, a country of mountains, the powerful local identities, should benefit from a d' decentralization, l' image of Western nations, but the United States-wanted to transform it into a centralised, strong presidency, abolishing the post of Prime Minister who had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not controls foreigners, especially l' elections scheduled in April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s and well before l', dependent on foreign aid.
No industry n' was en route, no dam n' in irrigation system, no important d' n' is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing happened, except n' fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to l' private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been necessary.
The noise was widespread as l' Afghanistan had d' vast mineral wealth.
This n' made qu' add to the sense that Westerners n "s' were there for them.
Without energy to treat iron ore or copper, or means of transport for l' export through the mountains, it was not n' d' mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving archaeologists international (funded by the World Bank) search l' Buddhist site and remain the largest employers of the province.
One day we will have to also that l' Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, restore normal reports.
The French troops s' concluded on 20 November.
The new treaty is the continuation of traditional aid: School girls, boys, Department of French l' university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, to try to win the "hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aids and offensive actions, a service of "actions" civilo-military "for the Department of Defense (CIMIC), abolished in 2012, led, and carry out by a small French NGO, many work d' collective interest and action agricultural rehabilitation in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, in hand-of local "have been able to help contain l' insurgency: Irrigation, wells, drinking water, fruit trees, reforestation, soil protection and increase cultivable land.
That will leave us-like memory, after two billion euros d' military spending?
A far more modest budget would improve l' local living conditions, very tough in these valleys often over 2,000 metres altitude d'.
L' Embassy received dozens of small agricultural achievements written requests from local communities in Kapisa Province.
For qu' they release l' insurgency led by foreign entities, what farmers m' signalled it would maintain in their favour a small civilian assistance, controlled and that directly affects them.

A constitution in Egypt
C' is a new gamble of President Mohammed Morsi.
While l' Egypt is more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which grants him temporarily full powers, he decided to play her va-all.
Taking the world by surprise, he announced Wednesday that l' Constituent Assembly vote its final text tomorrow.
Just a week ago, the head of l' State had granted two months to this House to finish its work.
Nearly two years ago that l' Egypt s' based on a provisional text several times amended which renders institutional stability and led to legal entanglements.
This new initiative n' made qu' increase the divide in the country.
For his opponents, President perseveres in its "autocratic delusions" and "betray his word" and "trampling the law."
On the side of his supporters, it ensures that c' d' is a means to an end sooner rather than the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to renounce their project d' explain the text article by article, the Egyptians.
For President, c' is also a way of a popular and democratic legitimacy as the protests raged throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians vote favourably as l' said in an interview with l' weekly American Time.
D' as this remedy to a vote is precipitated l' ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, I keep full powers", ceux-ci before supposedly end after l' adoption of the Constitution.
C' is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, great Islamist majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most liberals were l' appeal.
Half-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, not having been able to communicate their views.
Representatives of Human Rights l', religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
So that the necessary quorum is reached, 11 people, substitute members were added hastily, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, c' is most often at l' unanimity that the items were approved.
Commentators have also d' fun because qu' only differences of the day has spoken around... l' hour of prayer, some members of the Committee suggested that the pendulum was poorly resolved.
The text, which was still in the process of "be voted yesterday evening, 234 articles.
Objects of attention, l' Article 2 is finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of the sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafi parties, for whom the establishment of "Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace" principles "by" the rules ", which would have allowed stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article n' has not been amended, was a sign of goodwill and respect for other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy", the Liberals, who see n' qu' a communication.
Because they l' Islamization of the Constitution is through d' other articles.
They include l' article 220, which gives l' Al-Azhar university an advisory role, especially with regard to verify the conformity of laws with the sharia.
According to the historian l' Egypt Sophie Pommier, c' is worrying because "people called pronounce are not elected and n' have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings d' a theocracy ".
Fears liberals are also fueled by the fact that the next president of the university should be much less moderate current l'.
"For l' hour, he was not n' d' religious involvement.
With this Constitution, it remains within the framework of State l'.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, for some trained in the French system "tempered Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledged "qu' there may be ambiguity around l' article 220, because the terms used borrow vocabulary.
It refers to "fiqh" Islamic jurisprudence, including [ed].
And the issue could in future l' ask to what extent of civilian judges are competent to decide upon. "
In-beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is much criticism of powers qu' it attaches to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argue that those-marks are significantly reduced compared to this qu' under l' former regime.
Another issue: The powers conferred on l' army.
According to the wishes of military l' review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Council for defence.
Nor are prohibited trials of civilians in military courts, as requested by the rights associations l' man.
These are also share their concerns about the text, qu' they consider liberticidal.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and l' insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on d' expression, freedom of the press.
In addition, no article is more similar to the protection of women, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only consolation is l' prohibition of torture by l' article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While Egyptian President should express s' last night on television, demonstrations are planned this after-noon.
The support of the head of State l' march them, Saturday.

"That was in Moscow:" Migrants save l' money to learn the language
While MEPs and human rights activists polémiquent on what will give the law on compulsory language test, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint-Petersburg and d' other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of l' Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose: Earn l' money to help their families back home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force and stipulates that each migrant worker must pass an examination of Russian.
For the moment, this rule is that those who have l' intention to work in the services sector, housing, services to individuals and retail.
However, over time, promises the Federal Migration Service, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of l' History of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate his linguistic knowledge in Russian for and renew his work permit.
Exempt only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language.
Persons who have received certificates or diplomas d' l' education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of centres d' review will be under auspices of l' l' Institute of Russian language Pushkin, l' University of l' friendship peoples l' d' State University, Moscow State University l' d' Saint-Petersburg and other d' d' higher education institutions.
Immigrants can take examinations in all cities: More than 160 centres have been established throughout the territory.
This initiative d' introduce examinations was supported by members of the State Duma d' and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law enters into force, the human rights defenders l' have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: Qu' is-ce que ça va?
What is Qu'-l' obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, any d' meet representatives of the migration service, it will reduce the number of people suffering from "l' slavery at work."
Many speak in defence of the rights of migrant workers, the Chief of Staff of the Russian Federal Service of migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before their departure.
Only a selection system organized will resolve to 90% the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and n' have no medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, certifies Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to cross dishonest people who, under the pretext of l' help, will provide a "trip" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of others is tourmenteront for months without food and paperless and must work between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"Home, they are promised a thing, and when they arrive, they are wrong, it is their passport, and they do not affect the expected wage," confirms the Chief Executive Officer of migration services for the work of the migration service Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don ’ t argue, the policeman!
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics d' coming to earn money l' Russia entrust qu' they are not only the language of the country where they want to go, but also qu' they write with difficulty in their own language.
This n' is, of course, not their fault, but their misfortune: Few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow ne serait-ce qu' fair primary education.
Indeed, their families n' not even have to feed their children not to mention the properly dressed and equipped to l' school.
When they arrive at l' qu' teenager, these young people earn l' money as soon as l' opportunity arises.
C' is difficult when you are not familiar with the language, they entrust-.
"You feel diminished and reduced".
Advocates of Human Rights l' notice however an important aspect of the Law on the language.
The reviews are intended solely for migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, he n' will not review or d' official workplace thereafter.
Yet, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defence d' enter"
Many immigrants d' qu' n' explain it is not so easy d' obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs l' money: Between 12 and 16 miles roubles.
And then you can obtain a false registration quickly to only 1,500 rubles.
Russian police know that we have forged documents, we have not n' d' registration, where d' cases d' extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what s' buy cigarettes, tea," said journalists Umed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
"Am quickly, without skimping-and buys you a beautiful work d' art"
From the first day of l' entry into force of the Act on the language, it was discovered that the papers d' n' registration of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates d' reviews of languages have been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers out d' colour printer.
Of course, their new owners have not had for nothing: Each migrant who hoped to facilitate examinations spent seven thousand rubles for this document.
C' is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: Below-cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and defenders of Human Rights l' s' agreed that l' short- term objective is to protect the system against corruption to qu' it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper."
Authorities may give to migrant workers who have n' could not validate l' review of the first time to attend courses of language.
Furthermore, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that involve n' not actively communicate with people.

The Ministry of Interior does not cover s' l' market weapons
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Ministry of Interior l' proposes to toughen the law against l' carriers d' civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Whether it qu' s' fire at weddings or killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
Police wants to ban the use of rubber bullets in public places and meet l' age d' permit port d' weapon from 18 to 21 years.
L' idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee for security and combating corruption, Irina Yarovaya who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons would be introduced to the State Duma d' shortly.
Everyone n' is not pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to resolve the problem by "tightening the screw."
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various centres of fire, require d' abandon this "senseless".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, told the Russian Service Vasiliy Lesnikov, lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, l' over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm that is registered in police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are some that strengthening laws concerning the civilian weapons will not prevent n' criminals s' supply on the black market.
According to them, you can find at Moscow n' aujourd' any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior l' says qu' it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: L' plant in l' officer
The black market in weapons provides via several channels.
The main channels are five, Victor Baranets, retired colonel who served 10 years the Ministry of Education and l' Headquarters.
Capture d' d' screen from a site taking orders d' weapons
The first is "the" is-c' military, including weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians Baranets," explains.
The second type d' weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals forces l' order.
Baranets qu' s' says he is both stocks of weapons stolen from police that those stolen directly to representatives of the forces of l' order.
Illegal guns go on sale since military warehouses.
Many of these latter have often been explosions.
Versions of "evidence indicate that some fires were started deliberately to conceal the deficit," explains l' former military.
For Baranets, manufacturers d' weapons are for something.
"We see factories d' private weapons that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell the weapons on the black market, including Moscow," says an expert.
One of the other sources of black market is smuggling.
An important part of pistols and guns from poor countries, as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes, a mafia s' is formed and organizes l' supply," adds l' former military.
D' where weapons?
The experts rated the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was established in 2011 by the Centre d' analysis problems and d' study to l' public administration.
Experts analysed the reports of the Ministry of Interior and l' Rosstat, the criminal records and public data portals for weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explained, has just l' l' and military forces.
Half of weapons on the black market s' is found "for lack of employees whose work is linked to the weapons," explains-Engine and thus in the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of firearms were places of military conflicts, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "excavations."
A seller and a consultant d' who asked to remain anonymous l' ensures that long person n' buys weapons found by these specialists of the search illegal; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will seek new goods in military warehouses.
The person purchases by an intermediary l' d' teaches a unit, for example a TT pistol.
He delivers the goods by a mesh screen.
"He transports in town and resells to 900 €per l' unit with two-chargers," says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all cases, for example, when crimes are d' be clarified, it makes a purchase of audit merchants d' illegal weapons," says the seller.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and buyer l' are usually through knowledge.
I consulted J' sites, blogs, this jusqu' qu' a type occurs and proposes to come to the station where a quelqu' Begovaya became m' take in a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the pistol, I l' gave on site
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, I must know a quelqu' who has a contact, explains the seller. I know quelqu' one, but I do not trust him.
There are sellers on markets, but there are also low-such as saying "From the person, who asked m' transmit that her daughter has lost a tooth".
Now buys j' even a pair of American l' d' fists to help a person to whom I trust.

Newbies looking for weapons in different ways.
Former L' military Victor Baranets s' is tried in both qu' buyer d' illegal weapons in the mid 1990s lorsqu' he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
Schemes, according to him, n' have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything to qu'."
"I thought in a luxury boutique," remembers the military.
He n' no secret to l' buyer, explains Baranets, you can try anything.
As a potential customer, not only have I buy d', it goes with the seller in the woods and installing a target.
"Let me take and when I am convinced that l' weapon works well, it begins to negotiate," describes l' expert.
A shop since his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on every where you can buy weapons "for different uses."
For that, we need n' d' any document and person to meet.
"It suffices d' have a sum d' money," wrote one-advertising on the site "Buy a pistol or a machine gun battle."
Users can leave their request and pose their questions.
And it sells to minors?
"Without a permit, of course," l' user "Ivan" (spelling).
"Buys TT. Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov" in its application.
The Federal Security Service issued a vast network of pick and shovel people wishing d' buy combat arms.

United States-: Employees of fast-Foods and supermarkets are on strike
Almost a quarter d' American teenagers spend by a cashier in McDonald' if
In recent days, a wave of protests mounted against low wages by supermarkets Walmart and the famous fast food chains such as McDonald', Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy' and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this wave will take l' scale or s' lost rapidly.
These actions are supported by unions and a number of associations d' left.
Parallel to increase l' modest wages received by employees of Walmart and fast food chains, events organizers want the establishment of unions.
This sector is for n' l' moment not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents per year?
The demonstrations began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", when a flood of rain balances s' grabbed million inhabitants s' d' hit l' America and triggering sometimes outbursts.
Ce jour-là, some employees of society Walmart, which employs worldwide 2.2 million people left their position to organize picket lines with unions and activists left stores company whose products are destined to consumers and small classes.
Walmart sells everything: The hunting rifles through car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
C' is why many workers poorly paid at Walmart shop solely on their workplace.
The price and the choice of products made of Walmart l' one of the groups most powerful Member-States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products including because of low wages of its employees.
They also complain about the difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or laptop scanners.
Participants demonstrations of "Black Friday" called for a salary increase, they complained that the price of l' medical insurance provided by l' company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
For the employee base at Walmart affecting 9.5 $l' hour c' is a sum qu' he cannot afford.
Scientists from l' Californian University of California at Berkeley show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 hour l', it would be the group 3.2 billion.
C' is 1.1% over this qu' it currently spends.
If Walmart l' transferred any increase in wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store their would 46 cents.
They spend in only one year 12.39 dollars more than now.
Supporters of Walmart note with satisfaction that the protests were held in only nine States and n' brought no prejudice to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 08: 00 to midnight the next day and Walmart has sold over this period 5000 articles in the second.
Its caisses have conducted a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
The door-floor of society Dan Fogleman said in an interview at the site of Huffington Post qu' left in any "less than five employees" Walmart had left their posts and that the protest was a "n' qu' operation among many other d' com '" from the union organizer.
"Customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were either Walmart stores (in this city, they are not very appreciated c' n' is why they are not yet implanted) but the McDonald' and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald' s announcement selling billion portions and after they did not even give you sick leave and do not pay the work you have done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council of New York
Currently, the minimum wage by federal legislation and that of New York is $7.25 l' hour.
The fast-Foods the increases with time, but few employees, on average basic affect New York $8.90 l' hour.
Nobody touch less qu' them in this city.
For me c' is inconceivable to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when almost one quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald' seconds after the school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay for a long time.
Aujourd' today, I find myself to interview McDonald' employees who complain of having to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children.
Other D' on the forum of the Wall Street Journal newspaper found comments saying qu' it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you feed them.
The demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. near the McDonald' o the 40th Street and Madison Avenue required cashiers and cooks of the fast-food are paid at least $15 l' hour, an increase of more than twice that the current minimum wage.
They also requested that establishment of unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits l' administration d' hinder and punish protesters d' a union by bullying or dismissals.
However, their administration l' simplifies rarely life.
For the union, s' take fast food remains a difficult task, and that, for practical reasons.
A major L' is extraordinary l' turnover.
They are not d' agreement
D' tumultuous manifestations stood near several other d' fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the gathering in the day near McDonald' of Times Square with l' intervention of several local Democrats, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, said: "If McDonald' announcement selling billion portions and after they did not even give you sick leave and do not pay the work you have done honestly!".
The demonstrators were supported by new-Yorkais d' other Democrats, including by the candidate for the post of mayor Bill De Blasio said that "we must all support employees of fast food for qu' they get a fair wage and economic well-being that deserves every New-Yorkais.
The New York Times has characterized this event as the largest qu' the fast food sector throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people attended that all n' were not employees of fast-food, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
L' moment it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will be small.

"At the moment, we sometimes n' moderately to trick the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies are used to collect the augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, c' is Google unveiled this summer his current model at its annual conference and in November, it was reported that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, according to l' interview with the director of 3D technologies interactive Microsoft Laboratory of Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, as scientists this society, the glasses are already l' ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating objects in virtual l' air with bare hands, by creating d' virtual spaces open.
Could you tell us --briefly what your research group?
- We are working on l' l' interaction between man and machine and we are at the same time d' expand the boundaries of this interaction.
L' humanity as a whole has remained at the moment the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes touch.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and the radical changes that occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox Kinect and sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is now sells aujourd' without Kinect because everyone s' interested in the order by the gesture.
- What we reserve l' future?
- Although the Kinect rendered l' physical interaction, many things take place on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The seizure of l' information was improved (the system receives more data), but the performance for l' moment, not really.
We are trying to change that, and we are working on d' truly 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We must break the computer world in ours, in the physical world, make it more tactile.
For that, however, we need to identify not only l' user, but also l' space that surrounds l'.
Thus, we can complete the real world by virtual objects in a form more practical.
First, we-débarrassons the silly virtual reality helmets!
- What you think-commands?
It is appreciated, but n' is-it not overstated?
We cannot say that it is the panacea: The issue of confidentiality arises because it qu' n' has not always want d' inform others of his actions or of his intentions.
In fact, each type d' interaction with l' computer is good, but everyone in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, no large gestures, but rather to discrete gestures, limited.
Gestures n' were not captured by the camera l' device but by a bracelet worn by hand which recorded movements of bones and muscles.
Currently he is great, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to size d' a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the Joint, for example: Gesture + voice.
- C' is to say?
- For example, how demanderiez-me you can spend this?
You would with the words and gestures.
- D' habit, I only speak.
- Oh, it will be difficult to recognize.
- So, do you want to force users to adjust s' depending on what the machine may not be at one point?
- Not necessarily, but it is s' d' rapprochement.
I think very soon we will have to work to l' development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify the reactions of l' man.
It can s' example laser sensors, they produce a pretty good resolutions in depth and c' is very important.
- If you s' interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect sensor, qu' is what-you not like n' in modern cameras?
They lack of resolution, depth or d' something else?
- In principle, c' is on the generation that we base our work on the 3D recognition.
It would, of course, be d' about 8 Megapixels with a speed of 1000 c / s.
But the problem n' them-camera is not the same, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to the last point, all existing technologies are good enough, it adds Labour designers d' algorithms.
It should be borne in mind l' resolution X and Y and Z.
Speed is also much, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 (c / o do not, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, our laboratory of Redmond gave touch sensors regular delay treatment between 1 and 100 µs, current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Everybody does not understand how this affects l' interaction of l' man and machine.
J' d' would need a device of this type in my work, but not requiring touch, to have more frames per second.
- But do-it must not increase the number of cameras?
- The aujourd' Kinect has three cameras "l'", which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is in fact a usual field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of l' object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or worse l' by increasing the volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, n' has not presented his glasses to the public.
Do you not think that a d'-view of everyday use l' technologies, augmented reality glasses are a l' platforms with the more prospects?
- Certainly, walking all the time with a smartphone hands n' is impractical but behold what I think: The best option would be a transitory "augmented reality" that you would from d' a cloud platform of glasses in the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal and c' makes their strength (the personal elements are those that you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: Augmented reality from glasses not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with d' others.
- Imagine a moment that the manipulation of objects in virtual holographic l' air is more accessible qu' Tony Stark in Iron Man but also the mere mortal.
There is a problem on which opponents at this point the finger n': There is no tactile sensation!
Hands feel nothings!
What answers your group prepares-advantage compared to this challenge?
- In my way, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in l' l' interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may very well be l' addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, l' techniques is an interesting l' use of second hand for support d' image.
It automatically records the pressures!
But there are also some technologies that are really intended to assign the such to these "images in l' air": E.g. interference l' rays ultrasound directed to a point where the finger and gives you the feeling, for the moment still low, d' a breath d' air on the fingertips.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrist that affect nerve endings fingers, they are also an axis of work opportunities.
- And you tried to deceive the brain?
Make him believe qu' he feels this qu' it should feel when he sees something?
- This is a good idea, we n' have not yet tried.
There is still a here-below on which it will take long the evil: How to suggest a quelqu' who is physically located in a very small space qu' it works in an open space almost infinite - we are working on the concepts of treadmill (nothing to do with those found in qu' fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, it sometimes n' moderately to trick the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality if interesting for the researcher: Many things are still l' absolute state of fertilization.

The reign of taste and not the culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continued the project "L' before guard-Petersburg" dedicated to urban that lie ahead, l' avant-guard culture and l' art.
This list ultra-selective has already allowed d' leading actors of the art scene in Saint-Petersburg whose achievements to-go beyond the border of the city and found a recognition in Europe, having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the painter outgoing Kirill Miller.
The entire city is Kirill Miller, the bearded man, dressed in red that can be crossed l' near the Russian Museum, the Jardin d' been or in festivals and openings connected.
Tables of Kirill Miller together always crowds, regardless of their place d' exhibition.
It is a Wide l' storytellers l' inherently social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a distinguished representative of l' before guard-Petersburg of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also a symbol of the city, its appearance makes people smile and cheerful.
He has recently taken in his hands a barrel organ and he became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg puisqu' it was ripe for this difficult role in its existence, its philosophy and its image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why is what you-the city while not red and yellow or blue turquoise for example?
- J' have chosen red as designer specializes in appearance and l' l' image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator d' image and society.
Although in society, everything that is not n' grey raises l' aggressiveness and unrest negative.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
Any l' history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when thou hast-understood that you had to be a painter?
- At l' exhibition Palace of Culture Nevskiy with my work.
J' have understood that c' was my path.
Then, the wave of older painters unofficial fell and the new, free, in my type, were misunderstood.
J' started me lier d' friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then n' had more vague.
I m' interested in theatre, fashion, music, all except the words.
- And all this s' is found in your artistic Clinic... - C' was important for me to be in the centre of the culture of Saint-Petersburg where to meet the best creative forces.
In 1995, j' have taken place at Pouchkinskaya-10 that housed before the work a club musical and artistic club, a bohemian, home of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born: The NAME, Tequila-jazz, I can still see Chnour arrive with the project "L' ear of Van Gogh."
Chnour and friends sang songs easy in play-back in swimsuits moulants, they were among them Igor Vdovin, composer, aujourd' fashionable.
When the group began performing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trakhtenberg animated pas mal d' emissions before l' when Hali Gali.
We gave them and Trakhtenberg c' is when his career began, but his training and education, we c' qu' he received them.
"D137 Photos," Club "Griboedov": These are the implications of the artistic Clinic.
Our employees are parties in both qu' accustomed.
I am a hero of the past century, when l' culture meant something.
In 2000, a survey was conducted in the press: C' was the price "The personalities of our city."
J' have been appointed "Painter l' year", and is c' while my reign ended.
This n' is impractical to work in a new era with d' old rules, I am a representative of the truth, l' honesty and culture of the past century.
, Aujourd' c' is easy to become popular, but the culture and popularity are different things, it may be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong and acuity.
Je vais avoir une exhibit "The Russian museum through the clowns."
The clowns belong to a category timeless.
Before quelqu' j' was a social, aujourd' today it hurts and scary d' be.
But with the clowns, erases s', the tragic falls.
J' loves the grotesque, j' have ideas grotesque.
For example, l' idea to save the world via disguise total and compulsory.
Aujourd' c' l' habit, is important, the mechanism s' outside, but not to l' interior of the person.
Would-be qu' we cannot give the hand, but he qu' rather lui cracher à la tronche.
And falsehood will be deleted in disguise.
T' - Recently we have seen in the role of the player d' barrel organ. - A cultural city must have this type of heroes.
That d' other than me can play.
- But can be-l' commercial art can also be beautiful?
Today - Aujourd' l' commercial art must be treated, delicate, sweet.
A breakdown of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided in herds, supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the corny another.
Aujourd', everything is divided into micro-communities, c' is difficult to please everyone.
I am not a Hundred Dollar to please everyone.
Aujourd' today, we must think about who you please.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas last stronghold!
- There are people qu' was thrown who come, c' side is the sexual and social works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will, 10 miles will not come and ultimately c' is less money management, d', withering.
J' have my fans, the main c' is not the fool, not to spoil the experience.
When j' was young, I painted tables qu' a collector has hung alongside Falk or Larionov.
J' have started with the tables are those qu' d' painted in end of life.
, Aujourd' often confused ideas.
We say: There is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has not n' culture, it n' has nothing to do.
I am a representative of culture d' yesterday j' grew up with l' example painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refusing l' money for painting.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, qu' is-what is lacking in Saint-Petersburg?
- Effective cultural experts.
It is this concept: The official culture.
But all may not work in culture.
Under the reign of good n' tsars, this was not like that, the Tsars did not understand the culture, but they included qu' to keep good experts.
In Moscow, there are good aujourd' consultants.
We have people here in Saint-Petersburg that could be experts, but they are discarded, because it is higher experts who will evaluate properly these experts and pave the way.
Currently, c' is the "rule of taste" that flowers.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense qu' they say honestly qu' they do not take any l' contemporary art, there are qu' painters who must be d' other museums.
- Pour toi, qu' is what-c' is Saint-Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg n' is not the cultural capital, there are in Moscow more culture, there is a ground for this.
And on our stones l' art is hard to grow.
We need a d' cultural and we have more d' writers and readers, c' is bad.
In Europe, there are many curious that will see exhibitions, concerts.
For us, this layer is very fine.
We must make art l' fashionable as c' was the case at the beginning of the last century.

Delivery under l' space
Earth is in danger.
Warming or a collision with an asteroid murderer.
Caravans of space shuttles with landlubbers aboard in a planet d' Relief.
To save humanity l', a big question arises: How to continue to support our species in weightlessness or on a planet Relief?
I believe there is no qu' n' much choice.
There are in fact two true planets that l' you can conquer, ne serait-ce que by hypothesis.
"It is s' Venus and Mars," said Vladimir, researcher Astronomical Institute l' d' State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars conditions are more adapted to life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
We cannot live qu' at very high altitudes or l' Venus orbit... in l' space.
We started to s' interested in issues of reproduction in space l' focusing on flora.
There is still a half-century, we conducted experiments on plants.
Four generations of peas grown on orbit were in no way of varieties.
Then, it was put into orbit insects, small flies flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent in l' space to see how developed an embryo in weightlessness.
It gets to the exit a chick completely normal.
C' is then that the problems start.
"The problem is related to the fact that the Chicks must find a support he must be put on his legs and start moving," explains the Laboratory Director of Institute l' problems Médico-biological l' Russian Academy of Sciences (BOPI) Vladimir Sychev.
Find no support, chicks waved s' disorderly.
And after 10 a.m., newborns saw their instincts entirely s' wither.
Chicks responded to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply after a few days.
"We now twice, then we abandoned because c' is simply impossible to work with them there-low," says Vladimir Sychev noting l' failure of l' experience with chicks in l' space.
The last "arch" with miniature organic animal was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the course "Bion" that will carry n' species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in l' space.
In principle, we discovered n' anything supernatural.
"He was still s' biosatellites and then c' is the only experience. It must do this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After l' landing, rats of space l' gave birth to their offspring.
Nevertheless, it fails to make reproductions directly into l' space.
This n' is not an easy task.
Losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike cattle, l' man is able, in principle.
L' Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, he is able to create a suitable emotional.
This type d' n' experience is not made for ethical reasons.
But women go in l' space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And l' female body is what l' humanity has more valuable.
Our gull s' soared and person on earth could not say s' he held after a flight in l' space.
If she could give birth to a child after the vol
"No response to this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, Retired sector l' rockets and space.
In June 1964, just a year after his flight in l' space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a girl.
The father of l' child, Andrian Mykolaiv was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been twice on orbit and have worked in extra-environment is axiomatic, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk continues.
We have little, very little cosmonauts who were n' and give birth to a healthy after long flights.
"And they s' are longer, it presents a danger even during flights in orbit," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of l' Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet l' humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, Radiation Protection and creating a d' artificial gravity.

Here in neutrally buoyant, cosmonauts s' cause extra-véhiculaires outings.
Water L' mimics l' weightlessness.
If for adults, l' water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, c' is their true element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm: Life on Earth from l' ocean.
Insofar as the baby is approximately 9 months in the lymphatic fluid from the womb, it is easier to s' used to l' water.
C' is logical, because since its birth jusqu' in the bath, it happens only 2 weeks.
"C' is very little to forget," explains l' swimming instructor for infants, Marina Aksenova.
In a nutshell, if l' elite l' weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs, d' gravitational force weight.
In weightlessness, the stomach muscles, pelvis s' atrophient very quickly, the capacity of the baby is lost.
Good d' agreement, ignore that relying on simulators d' delivery.
Sure we can prepare a baby in a special chamber, the woman will arrive at the break.
"And then?" Asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex issue.
D' another side, l' child also needs a d' artificial gravity.
He does not feel l' S' gravity, l' organization does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
We cannot dress an infant as an adult with a special combination for workouts.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case imagining birth d' a child in a foreign environment will lead to return to Earth d' a disabled child, fully désadapté", the Director of the Committee for the Bioethics Institute l' problems Médico-biological l' Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space l' still theory.
However, over time it will become a reality, when the Terrans will visit their shuttles to a distant planet which will become l' habitat of their offspring born in l' space.

The ISC l' (Supreme Audit Institution) said: "The control pseudo independent work (in Czech)" system "Švarc failed because politicians.
In the area of procurement, the Czech Republic has d' inspectors and d' good legislation but it is lagging behind in terms of its application.
This C' qu' said Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of l' Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, c' is what is lacking among us," said Kila in his commentary on the current situation.
Control inspectors conducted jointly by Czech and German also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited as an example of abusive practice l' approach to the "system" Švarc by Petr Nečas.
Prime Minister recently stated that the ODS 'n' would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls; is-this therefore permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied d' d' one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent d' act a d' authority to inspect d' demand respect for the law," says Kala.
At the meeting of the Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a project tchéco German-in which were compared legislation on public contracts of these two countries.
What was-it matter?
It is s' d' parallel control that we launched about two years.
In simple terms, European legislation stipulates how manage public procurement and specific national legislation and practice qu' proper follow him.
We collected all this and that this control is not yet complete, we are very interesting differences emerged: Generally speaking, our legislation may be "-tougher and better ", however, some parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms qu' it is not enough to continually elaborate rules increasingly detailed but qu' it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law.
How will this project can help you-and-qu' results in negotiations for you?
A common control of this type should contribute to what we stopped strive to clarify the laws, to decline and improve d' thresholds, when this n' was not a really positive.
The principle of good governance means the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest) to exclude d' enrichment and a possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the contracting thresholds are not necessarily n' will reach this goal.
It may be that this system is so swamped by paperwork, that those seeking loopholes will find much more d' opportunities if the threshold remained above.
You talk about internal problems concerning the implementation of legislation on public contracts.
How does the control system in Germany?
-advantage is an institution similar to our ISC or a different organization d' mode?
In terms of institutions, similarly to ISC l' works là-bas Bundesrechnungshof is similarly, it also has a d' council slightly differently, but these two institutions are fundamentally similarly.
Skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however compared to our system: L' Germany is a federal structure, it has therefore also auditors of this kind at the level of the Länder.
The Bank can only control l' federal money, which is home to the resources of l' State.
Public funds managed with the regions and municipalities, are low-controlled at the level of the auditors of the Länder.
As regards national legislation, is-it simpler than ours?
I do not want to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, l' Germany is often referred to as a model but it can scarcely be said she qu' do better in all areas.
C' may be due to the fact qu' they have better inspectors?
No, surely not, but I repeat, I do not have data for comparison.
However, it must be said that this country that we consider a model is also facing a series of problems.
Otherwise they n' no advantage to cooperate with our institution, right?
As regards national legislation, qu' meant for you, as an institution, qu' l' amendment to the law on public procurement, its effects are already-they?
The amendment entered into force relatively recently, it has not yet n' d' impact on our operations control.
As we ex post controls, he takes with some delay.
Our observations include, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument to detect "risks of mismanagement" with which we have scrutinized nearly 14,000 procurement - those changes would, of course, because the thresholds were modified so that the conditions of certain types of procedures d' calls d' offers and so on.
Is-what so you consider l' adoption of this Act rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for l' administration?
I think this constitutes a step in the right direction and j' hope future l'.
The problem that can arise is that these rules will become tougher and qu' it is not possible to observe them.
Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) compelled controlled subjects to accept that any violation of the law on the markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is-he really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse but not punish those who commit formal errors without effect on the decisionmaking process.
Such a system will put pressure on advantage d' l' administration.
So what is the solution for s' out?
Look at where we n' will not.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that l' ODS n' would not disturb entrepreneurs with controls of self-saying Švarc qu'-system - is what this means?
The system is Švarc-it prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied d' d' one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent d' act a d' authority to inspect and d' demand respect for the law.
It may declare: "We will change the law and allow l'", but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing was n'.
The law on the markets has relatively strict rules on formalities, precisely in order to protect l' appeal d' offers.
But it is also a tragic qu' bidder be removed only for formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and c' is, in my opinion, what is lacking among us.

Roads are in places frozen, but most remain feasible.
In some areas of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also slops.
The network remains largely passable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Region of Karlovy Vary
In the region of Karlovy Vary, roads were this morning, but also patchy frosts and snow.
Temperatures plummeted and oscillate between -5 ° C and -10 ° C, but they should slightly back in the day.
Snowfall have ceased in the region and it remains in the Plains qu' a thin layer of snow.
The ridges of the Ore Mountains (Krušné Mountains), however, are covered d' about 30 centimetres of snow.
According to the data of Extended Area Service d' road maintenance qu' due to the fog, visibility was reduced by locations.
The expressway A6 and national roads in the region are now passable without difficulties.
Vigilance remains, for example on some bridges with the coating may be frozen and slippery.
All the departemental roads and the third category, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There is still on some of their sections of leftover frozen compacted snow and places by traffic.
Especially in areas aloft, drivers must strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Directorate of roads and highways reported on its website that some roads in East Bohemia l' are threatened by the formation of ice and snow layers of compacted by traffic may be on the roads in the mountainous and located aloft.
Services d' road maintenance warn drivers against the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region located aloft.
Freezing rain can occur in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička Svitavy, or High Mýto, mainly on the departemental roads and third category.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is found primarily in the Karkonosze () and the Krkonoše Mountains l' Aigle (Orlické Mountains).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow packed by traffic is present on the roads in the areas.
East Bohemia l', time will now aujourd' dry, most often, with potential d' cloudy periods.
It will be a light wind and temperatures generally range between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen region
Roads Pilsen region are now aujourd', although, in places, it should be evidence d' increased vigilance and d' adjust to weather.
It freezes this morning temperatures fluctuate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After recent snowfall and cooling that followed, some lines of communication can be patchy frosts.
Drivers can s' wait through areas of fog, improve visibility s' however gradually.
This C' qu' reports of Extended Area Service d' road maintenance.
L' D5 motorway is almost without difficulties, services d' road maintenance recommended increased vigilance between km 80 and 131.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third category are moist and in this case s' applies the warning against sections frozen.
Drivers must be vigilant, and particularly on the road less traveled in the region of the Šumava.
D' Olomouc region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region d' located aloft must aujourd' count with a layer of snow and soft on the roads.
This layer remained on Col said "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment.
Snowfall forced this night staff d' road maintenance to get on the ground; services in charge of the road, he fell more than 3 cm in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most roads are passable without difficulties.
"On the heights of the District of Šumperk are remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling towards Jeseník must expect to meet s' Pass said "Červenohorské sedlo" a layer of snow and soft "aujourd' ČTK said at the head of road maintenance d' District Šumperk.
Their colleagues Jeseník District also visited during the night; the latter, after chemical treatment, roads, are now identified and wet, even in those areas.
In the district d' Olomouc roads are passable without difficulties, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in sections in forested areas to pavements remained moist.
Regions d' Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, services d' road maintenance of Northern Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
The data from the police, qu' in addition to some areas covered by snow or ice from the mountain roads to Telnice Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero in lower altitudes, and therefore the snow and sleet should stay on roads. In the plains, especially south is Plateau Central Bohemia, he n' was, on the contrary, no problem and roads are generally dry.
No difficulty of movement n' was reported at the moment.
Services d' road maintenance reported the presence of ice, especially around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, nighttime conditions were ideal training: Rain and melting snow during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
It was also noted, since the main axes of movement, difficult conditions on national highway 13 at the border between regions d' Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches d' trees bent under the weight of snow jusqu' to reach the road.

Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect l' positive energy."
That think-you the fact that at least one month d' this should be the end of the world?
This is one of those qu' n' alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love.
In our group The Tap Tap, rigole rather and it is said that we are the only group able to collect a rest d' positive energy in order to delay or prevent d' the end of the world.
In addition, you get in December a totally unique: Three concerts at the end of the world.
Can-you provide further details on this project to our readers?
C' is a charity that we prepare for two years.
We decided d' use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December at 11 hours 10am.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They completed almost the culmination of the Maya calendar on l' island of Kiribati in l' Pacific Ocean, on a timezone ahead of 12 hours compared to us.
Who was this idea?
Initially I think c' was my idea, then we all designed with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to collect enough d' positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, consider l' state of the world that we leave to our children.
To l' opportunity to the end of the Maya calendar, we have created a collection d' unique objects, including T-, shoes, bags, and original keys on the end of the world, buying online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The group The Tap Tap with d' other interpreters has also recorded a hymn to the end of the world who s' entitled "cancelled" End of the world (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, hears l'-Engine and thus also in these concerts charities?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and that the end of the world has not n'...
It will be sung by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
Hymns will join also at some point in the framework d' a live show, unique, Czech Television.
The lyrics of the song was written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X sang also...
How are-you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities d' show-biz Czech, due to the fact that we organise concerts and charitable events...
We strive to make them participate intensively to these projects.
It is clear that most s' d' them are interested in such cooperation and fun.
What will the benefits of these concerts on the end of the world?
To equip the training centre Studeo which is accessible for disabled people and we are working on the realization in the institute l' Jedlička association with l' Tap, and for six years.
Teachers regularly visit students institute l' Jedličkův activities for fun and interest.
Students them-same n' not have the means to go to courses, we try to assist them in this way.
Within the framework of l' completion of l' Jedlička institute, we will transfer this project in a new building independent.
Several groups of music and interpreters will perform on stage in each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, avez-vous les chosen?
We tried d' develop a program that s' address all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will perform on Chinaski, Support their country, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Prepare-you also d' other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the framework of the Prague Spring; here too, we prepare a program with guests.
We would also like to play l' next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the United-States, j' would combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalistic jusqu' here you played by example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is nevertheless a group of persons with disabilities.
How you manage-l' organization and the logistics of your tour?
This n' is not so terrible that it has l' air at first.
We have five members whose electric wheelchair devices must travel in the hold, of course we trimbalons also much baggage and boxes d' instruments....
S' Jusqu' here is more or less well, CSA and British Airways were always well prepared for us, they have surprised m' d' once more.
Even in Moscow, d' where we returned recently, all s' passed without problems.
Thanks to your travel to foreign l', you can compare what these countries differ in terms of d' access facilities for the disabled, l' l' public attitude towards people with disabilities and so on.
What were your experiences jusqu' far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and d' other places where everything works better than we have just witnessed in Moscow to qu' l' all n' is still in the initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; là-bas, it is not yet common n' qu' a person uses only in electric wheelchair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet as obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair lift.
Fortunately, low-, an association s' d' l' trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is currently d' be established.
What must-we still catching up with the more developed countries?
There are lots of things for which we are still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and refinements always depend on the efforts of the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a handicap move alone in public spaces; they can go to the bathroom, the museum, n'...
This n' is still not very common là-bas qu' a large number of persons with disabilities participate actively in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are the contrary to the edge!
Respect for the public and facilities d' access are one thing, but the situation begin to change when we have among us athletes, artists, actors, politicians and lawyers.
For the time being, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong willingness.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, go back a few years-qu' is what led in 1998 to create this group?
J' started work as an educator qu' l' Jedlička institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in s' something.
And as I-even musician (I play, among others, saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a musical activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič, it was a bit lost control of the situation (laughs).
The success came n' qu' in recent years, if I am not mistaken?
C' is true, to build relationships with known singers and work actively to promote the group has helped.
We understand that, if a work n' is not visible, it is like c' s' n' not exist at the bottom.
Subsidies of l' European Union, we can, we allow d' have faculty of quality, equipment, and so on.
Had you-objective d' reach this level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, j' qu' have felt there was a potential for change things.
Show business is full of tips that will copy each other.
D' a way, c' is logical: Everything is new is accepted with caution and it lasts longer.
Rare are the original projects, and j' dare say that Tap Tap is a l' d' between them.
The first impression d' someone who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, c' is natural...
But pity is totally pointless, because people with disabilities are not people suffering, abandoned, that we must take pity.
These are people who can live a life and s' flourish, provided d' have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities are able to achieve something n', this is not just a step forward for them, but for the whole of society.
Is-what your success is not n' also due to the fact that you are a leader demanding, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do the work of quality, we must be intransigent in many areas and require discipline.
But I think c' is quite normal.
Some people arrive at us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize they must come qu' rehearsals twice a week, follow the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road for concerts, they rapidly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in each group who wants to work and achieving goals.
The group The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
'How many of them were already here in 1998?
One, Láďa Angelovič.
Nous sommes un groupe opened, people come and go, n'.
Our doors are always open for those who want to or wanted to join us.
It will be the case the day before the scheduled day of the end of the world on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in l' Incheba arena, Brno and Ostrava to Fléda at Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and d' other musicians in the Czech Republic.
In the late evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when sung the song of the group The Tap Tap "cancelled" End of the world.
The purpose of the concert is to collect financial resources ($25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional Studeo training centre located in Prague in l' Jedlička institute.
The price d' a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, l' entry is free for children jusqu' at 12 years, the presale tickets is open to Bohemiaticket.

Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of Ministers of l' European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as twentieth member of this agency, she is the second Member State of former East bloc l' l' (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun a close collaboration with l' ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of projects of l' agency.
The road to Poland to l' space has however began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Poles who worked on space flights; they do not always understanding.
I would like to mention the conference of A. Šternfeld l' observatory in Warsaw on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his book d' avant-guard entitled "Introduction to IAA l'."
Developments in this young engineer (born in 1905) left listeners cold and years later Šternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski s' attracted to its work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to IAA l'."
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a big propagator l' astronomy and IAA l'.
He published hundreds d' articles in the Polish newspapers and wrote prolifically on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of IAA l', his contribution has been rewarded by the fact that his name was given a l' craters of the Far Side of the Moon.
From 1925 was built in Poland railway d' intended to be fitted with a rocket engine.
It is unfortunately neither l' author nor the details of this project.
He n' is also not clear if the rocket was meant to propel or inhibit the speeder.
The only known information on this are those of the railway press l' era.
In 1933, l' Polish artillery began to devote himself to rockets.
The research was conducted by l' institute Komórka Tromp Uzbrojenia in collaboration with teachers and Mieczyslaw Wolfke Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
According to records held that this research had reached the trials.
Of course, with l' arrival of German armies, research has stalled.
In 1937, plans a rocket d' photoelectric hunting, designed by l' Rohoziński engineer, appeared in the press and l' next year was published l' book "- Rakieta torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" d' an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects aiming at a military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects d' use of the rocketry were conducted by the Scientific Advisory Board ("provisional Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), who coordinated all work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, d' other work on aviation l' were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is question d' a society in the November issue of the journal 1954 Problem, in which are four more detailed articles on l' Aeronautics.
In l' one of these articles written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to IAA l'
At that time, projects of artificial satellites had already been launched and it was clear that the field of Space Research had l' future.
At the beginning of 1956 l', the Polish Astronautical Society (ATP) deployed efforts to enter the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and l' fall, PTA became a regular member.
L' next year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He retained his position jusqu' to his death in 1959.
From 1956, the ATP brought a significant contribution to the successful development of the rocket RM (Meteorological Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket d' a range of 1800 metres had 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Thereafter was built an improved version, RM-1A, and during summer of 1959, l' test rocket flight to two floors RM-2 were initiated in the desert of Bledov.
This rocket had a length of 1.4m and weighed probably 11.5 kg.
The prototype following should have been able d' perform science - the rocket RM-34 should have a range of jusqu' to 14.5 km and serve to observe the winds aloft.
But in 1963, all development work were halted.
The Meteor-1 rocket development during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded first rockets type RM.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of l' space for scientific tools.
The rocket Meteor-1A had d' space with a volume of 0.4 litre, whereas in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and Meteor-1C 0.62 litre.
The maximum range of all these types d' device was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, rockets Meteor-2 were developed in l' Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of delivering a payload of 10 kg at an altitude d' approximately 60 km.
Subsequently were built versions (Meteor-and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning l' entry of Poland to the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and establishing a national committee d' COSPAR two years later.
In the program Interkosmos, Poland has also participated in l' exploration on the Soviet satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut this program.

L' repeal of the law on Public Utility d' n' is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on the work d' public utility.
This decision has raised in l' public discussion.
It is no doubt interesting d' examine this issue d' a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented toward liberalism, both in l' EU that in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more economic competition unregulated.
This means that economic entities as well as national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with each other.
This is the principle of freedom of trade and traffic free (unlimited) of private capital with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of work (wages) generate pressure on prices.
It should be put under this term the following meaning: A producer s' working by l' importation of goods sold cheaply to withstand economic competition in "making it more expensive" the price of the competitor, to remove d' greater market share and d' increase its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: Either transfer production to l' foreigner, or buy cheaply or disappear. The result is a unemployment in countries where labour costs are high compared to other d' economies.
Given that the private capital has no responsibility n' socially and thereby responsibility towards unemployment qu' it engenders social charges are necessarily l'.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of Messrs. entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby to offset the social and economic damage caused to l' whole society through the race for profits.
This situation is such a known n' qu' it is not necessary to provide statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices private capital in different economies create a situation in which the governments of the countries are forced to engage in mutual competition to artificially lower the social level of their own population in the goal d' attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account l' social collapse.
This occurs primarily in the amendments of existing laws.
L' objective is to compel economically its own population to accept the diktat of the price of private capital, particularly in the field of wages.
This occurs d' by a system of economic constraints in case of unemployment in the long term and other d' by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
As a result, growing poverty and deepening l' differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there are for years of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
There are already by million of these people.
Within the framework of l' increase the competitiveness of l' German economy, it is quite common that employees receive such salaries l' State will be obliged to pay extra for qu' they reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The measures d' economy virtually all the southern Member States EU l', without doubt, a similar situation in which, under pressure d' catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced to emigrate d' (as was the case in the 19th century), to languish with wages, on the fringes of society, in l' hope one day qu' private capital to invest in their country.
He should ask the following question: D' where will this capital?
S' d' from other EU countries l', poverty will d' a country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, Indian, a Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction d' a European salary.
This includes any l' Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media, s' parfait, l' State cannot make investments in capital in its own economy, that l' command economy led to economic disaster.
Private capital defends hard l' idea that l' State cannot intervene in l' economy by regulatory interventions.
Then you wonder whether private capital n' not influence and even aujourd' does not, according to its own selfish interests, politics and the same l' whole State.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The evidence is there is a lobby qu' virtually all-powerful and present in all states.
This results in a desperate situation occurring in the field of corruption, by granting d' l' mutual benefit, in the legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such, qu' due to a lack of financial means, the national ministries delegate l' development of draft laws to firms d' lawyers closely linked to l' industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The entire power is not of the people, as expressed in the Western constitutions, but powerful financial groups for their own interests.
It is clear that democracies geared toward liberalism are now quickly face the situation described by Appianos in his book "the crisis of the Roman Empire 'at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The' State had long been in decline and functions were assigned by violence.
Les coups de pots-of-wine, favors received illegally, and stones and swords were also used for these positions.
The bottom-of-table and corruption were spreading without limits and the people went to the election with voices already sold "..." People honest does not sought to obtain functions, the result was once l' State was 8 months without Honorary ".... 'We actually to say that the solution to this difficult situation was an autocracy and qu' to choose an energetic man"... It is true qu' Appianos l' Pompey had in mind, but c' is Caesar who turned irreversibly democracy in absolute rule.
In conclusion, as in l' antiquity, the society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for l' interests of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital n' is more capable of understanding and to promote the interests of society as a whole.
Consequently, as aujourd' decadence, an unprecedented elites, without any effort to reform.
We must therefore seek out the causes of l' emergence of fascist and communist regimes in liberalization without scruples of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In l' stands, the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites ignore completely l' possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human lives, humanitarian crises and social aujourd' we are the witnesses as well as crimes against humanity l' as we know them by l' past and recent.
L' repeal of the law on the work d' n' utility is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both internationally qu' internally, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is to sociopolitical reforms that strengthen capital investments of l' State in l' economy, increase l' influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of l' State.

"Nothing will ever violence and can never says" Sting in the song Fragile whose towards the refrain is "n' not forget how much we are fragile."
"If my sons did not want war, he n' would not," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, d' many reactions were high.
Some take the party d' Israel, citing his right to defend itself l' and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, d' other support the Palestinians, citing Racism l' State d' Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and recognizing Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim in its recurrent waves of killing; after all, the current inhabitants d' Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the current political situation and n' have not experienced the commencement of violence.
I would like to give readers a point located "behind the scenes" on those who are mainly continued tensions already since more than 95 years (from the Balfour Declaration of 1917) in a small piece of countries of the Middle-East.
Some of these reflections s' based on historical facts available at l' study, other d' emerge from my own understanding of, or more exactly the group d' individuals, which is the main instigator of events of l' modern history.
L' L' history of humanity is primarily l' history d' a struggle for power.
Each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What n' is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or s' they owed their actions to the throne a quelqu' who ran their actions based d' goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and the resulting financial powers n' could not be done during d' one generation.
Among families with a huge wealth from the Rothschild family, which could be seen as the head of octopus (j' is uncertain whether these families still have a leader but I do not exclude l').
Little is written on them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s 19th century, they have acquired the first global news agency (Reuters) to stop l' establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts they were mixed and who had always meant a strengthening of their power, an increase of their wealth or both.
They have interests in almost most major central banks in the world and preparing or carry out wars against the countries in which they have not yet n' such shareholdings (before l' l' invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after l' invasion of Iraq l' 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4-time, Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to Bank of America of Rothschild the status of central bank and began to issue during the civil war his own money (government, j' hear) and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to emit l' clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when qu' he wanted to bring an action against the EDF for initiating the Great Depression.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in 1859 in 1871 to formulating a plan d' three world wars by Albert Pike, a blunt-mason initiated the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war aims d' eliminate major state monarchies d' Europe, the second should abolish colonialism, especially in the UK, and the third should reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion d' individuals (such a quantity d' slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (l' ecumenism n' being anything other than d' l' began d' such a solution) and, in the end, acquiring an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the 'following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF designed to prevent are not repeated crises such as those qu' they produced in 1907).
After successfully trigger the First World War by l' assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the throne austro-Hungarian, they destroyed Tsarist Russia in causing the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly by a German surrender without justification (economic and military war n' was more necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of l' Austria-Hungary, the power d' Central Europe.
Easier for the outbreak of the Second World War, bankers have left politicians create a situation of latent conflict: They have a d', imposed on Germany l' enormous war reparations generating conditions d' radicalization of the impoverished masses (they can then place a sufficiently forceful leader, pointing to the culprits, offering simple solutions d') and, secondly, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including d' a strong German minority who should play the role (qu') was fifth column to put the hornets and trigger a war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, including a l' branches d' aspira to create a Jewish State, preferably in the region of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned ci-dessus laid the groundwork d' mass emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first Arab friction with the local population began.
Terrorist acts were committed by and other d'.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult d' determine whether Hitler has broken the chains in which international bankers l' had initially; or if everything qu' he was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of Jews d' Europe in the concentration camps created the foundations of a Jewish State d' l' acceptance by the international community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany l' were l' origin of the Second World War, the founding of l' State d' Israel has lit a fire d' can cause a third world war.
If international bankers can trigger this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time the Arab population or generally Muslim Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country but internationally (just see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders d' Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-I call Mr Azzolini, where a wrong creates another wrong in a circle of violence and contains l' origin of all, the greed of some individuals and their desire d' acquire power on the world?
We must make the difference between ordinary citizens d' Israel and their leaders, because as we offer international bankers do people in elections that their own candidates.
Current Prime Minister L' d' Israel is a typical example of a politician fascisant, loyal to international bankers, to start a war with Iran, which could l' due to l' membership of this country to l' Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) s' extend to become a global conflict and, given that l' Iran controls the Hormuz Strait d' which handles 20% of all the world ’ s oil (this corridor naval n' has a width than 2 miles) and create a destruction of l' global economy.
What were the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and the people to accept a new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves d'.
A world in which a handful d' aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which all newborn is stationing at birth a microchip a be completely controlled.
"Qu' oblige all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to cover the front hand or an iron mark qu', so he will not buy or sell whoever does not the name of this wild beast or the figure of his name.
We must include: That was the common sense of the fierce beast.
This number denotes l' man and c' is six hundred and sixty six. "

The film Argo: When everything goes wrong, call in Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators consisting d' students took d' l' Islamists attack US embassy in Tehran and held hostage 52 diplomats.
They should be released in exchange for Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States-who supported his regime for decades.
The situation was not n' l' Administration d' positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because qu' she would severely undermined the confidence of its allies in d' other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to l' establishment d' a theocratic regime, she n' was able d' secure the release of the hostages.
C' was a blow to the prestige of the United-States, compounded later by the fiasco of the attempted rescue of hostages by force.
Kidnapped diplomats were eventually released 444 days later, following the negotiations by the Algerian Government.
Their fate to United States-led a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan in the presidential elections in 1980.
The film l' Argo, director and actor Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory at l' America.
Just before qu' it is occupied, six employees of escaped s' l' Embassy.
After ups complicated, they found themselves in the residence of l' ambassador for Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to break d' Iran through hay coverage: They left the country with Canadian passports as members d' a film crew doing locations for filming a movie d' dramatic science-fiction.
Combination of genres
The l' exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required collaboration d' Hollywood.
To make the legend more credible, specialized magazines made this draft film, press conferences were held and a production company fictive had real offices.
Details of secret operation l' were long, the film is based on memories of Tony Mendez.
The film d' Affleck is a combination of several genera.
It is a s' d' d' a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie", the story d' a successful d' a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy as Ocean', twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres: Sequences of Tehran (in documentary style sequences are presented under-titrées iconic photographs of time l' events and how, through these photographs, these situations have been transcribed in the film, he n' no major differences),
Passages lighter d' Hollywood, treated with irony and a little d' exaggeration
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions d' with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables in the corridors and the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career.
Actor D' ridiculed, he became a respected director and actor d' ceased to generate mannerisms.
Argo is his third feature-film after the dark officer "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
C' is also the first film Affleck d' who does not take place in his city d' origin, Boston.
The sense of atmosphere l' d' l' a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films in top-Hollywood standards.
Affleck is also proof of this sense of l' atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held by Canada."
The best scenes of the film takes place in the streets, in the reconstruction of facts; the initial sequence of the fall of l' Embassy is impressive in its clarity that also suggests confusion and l' unpredictability arising when suddenly, in a given place, s' wrote a page d' history.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the false crew in the bazaar of Tehran).
Too d' shares to too d' places
The director had to settle a matter d' n' offering in fact that few exciting film scenes, in the sense of the term.
He s' doing well, he adds some elements to reality and the result is not always n' elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis l' airport in Tehran is overcome by a phone call in America and continuing on the runway landing d' are quite farfetched).
Weak d' Argo lies in his character dispelled, due to the need to show too d' events in too d' locations.
It is true S' qu' Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of Hollywood cooperators, their characters merited place and this is not far from there, only in this case.
The film d' Affleck lack a bit of tension, he suggests with moderate interest, enjoying the retro 1970s.
It causes the viewer, but with difficulty.
As a reminder, d' d' a story still somehow incomplete to date, and as an illustration of the exaggeration of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, l' case.

Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts each year a public inquiry into bank charges the most absurd, decided, now, to launch the regulation or ideas from "workshop" l' EU most absurd.
"The fact that EU envisages l' recently, d' adopt a quota of 40 per-cent of women for the management of large European companies was l' origin of our decision," said the newspaper Právo l' organizer of this investigation, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there are already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court d' unify d' insurance premiums for men and women.
Jusqu' now yet women were advantaged in terms of life insurance rates because they represent qu', objectively, a lower risk for companies d' insurance.
People can report jusqu' at the end of year l' any idea of "incredible workshop l' l' EU."
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013" informed Nacher.
Among the controversial l' EU regulations, for example, l' obligation d' add components bio fuels, which has detrimental consequences for l' environment, or ban l' d' use the reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain qu' relatively low d' a hazardous substance or the directive concerning the size cages chickens, which resulted in l' increase in the prices of eggs.
Critics have also been issued in the past to l' l' prohibition against de facto d' use l' expression "butter spreads" or withdrawal of the sale of light bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size 14 centimetres.
L' European administration reacts often under pressure d' a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are usually held in Brussels by a State or group d' states (and the Czech Republic currently imposes requests for its banks threatening d' use his veto).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, l' origin of the fact that in l' Union, bananas must not be d' a smaller size to 14 cm or submit a curvature "abnormal".
The European Commission is defended s' arguing qu' she did qu' harmonize national standards nonhomogeneous complicating the trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite l' opposition of some States, claiming that the existing directives wasteful of foodstuffs.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey of EU l' l' last year that must be on balloons a warning that children under 8 years should not inflate unattended d' adults.
EU L' referred to a U.S. survey that the balloons are among the toys, the leading cause of death by suffocation d' children.
A similar restriction s' applies to children under 14 years with regard to blow into trumpets.
Here also, strange ideas.
The following rule regarding European officials them-same is quite absurd: Because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece, anyone who has an official function within l' EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should, instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with l' association "Leave To" of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com appointed in this survey, in addition to absurdities mentioned ci-dessus, l' Union concerning the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
EU L' had set maximum volumes for the reserves of foodstuffs which may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to EU l'.
The Czech Republic, for example, then increased volumes set for only canned mushrooms and, as a result, a heavy fine.
The organizers of this investigation found interesting l' idea to pay sums d' money in some countries because they have not n' qu' d' access to the sea and l' idea d' grant a grant to ask l' subsidies.
These ideas are not from Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact of not having to sea.
We will ask l' European Union reimbursement. "Thus s' l' is expressed in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture l' l' time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
It argued that, because of our production of wheat, and procurement expressed "interventionist", the State 's' was found with stocks full qu' he had then export.
According to Palas, l' EU should have we pay millions d' euros, because the Czech Republic is located far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organized a call for tenders d' l' purchase of wheat from the country without marine access.
Subsidies for l' obtaining grants were proposed to the Commons by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), those-ci, concretely, should be used to write applications for grants from Brussels.
L' EU states: "Bizarre regulations are rare."
If the regulations are often critics in the Member States, according to many experts, efforts by l' EU regulation and improve l' d' effective operation of l' Union and in the area of its overall development, rather deserve praise.
Worse, for example, according to experts, the problem of l' use of l' EU grants for projects that n' have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening l' European integration, but have been imposed by the Member States in the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other countries of d' l' Union, fight in Brussels for the right d' use specific names for these traditional products (which she does not always winner) arouses strong emotions among Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", in the name of "l' Tuzemský rum" dating back to the 19th century, our producers have been replaced by the name "Tuzemák."
Only the products alcohol d' cane sugar, and not with beet sugar, can bear the name of rum.
In the official list of registered products of EU l' found in aujourd' company globally known as the Feta cheese or Gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan or Parma ham and biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp and Pohořelice Třeboň ("Pohořelický has Třeboňský kapr") and hops in Žatec ("Žatecký chmel").
Spice bread d' Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets of Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their Community trade mark.

People want I saves the Republic, but I am a fan, qu' expresses Senator Okamura
Senator, how has-Engine and thus l' idea to stand in presidential elections?
This is not n' d' be senator or president who account for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would candidate nowhere.
But I no longer supports to see as the country is looted over the last twenty years, thieves are not under locks and taxes and l' age of retirement increases.
I had not n' l' ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something, then I try d' provide a solution to change that.
And as j' have more than 40 years and I am independent, member d' no party, I have not n' d' alternatives to influence the situation to stand in presidential elections or to the Senate.
You entered the Senate but you quickly en route to the Castle (Alexey: Siege of the Presidency).
Is-what you do not turn our backs on those who you have elected?
J' have always said that I will be in the battle for Château according to the results of the senatorial elections
Subsequently, j' have said that if j' was elected senator, I would in presidential elections.
My purpose is not n' function, ci-qu' n' is a tool allowing me to make my vision.
C' is why j' ai besoin de l' influence the largest and the broader mandate.
The problem is not only n' qu' as a nation we râlons at the bar or in front of the television, but is also c' and trampling all those who try d' bring the change.
This adds s' press fragmenting the reputation of persons and confounds freedom of speech and freedom of lying.
It was, for example, what I said to my misreporting journalists or j' have been Councillor Jiří Paroubek.
Just-in your visions.
You started the fight for Château with as workhorse themes of material responsibility and criminal politicians and tax returns retroactive to beyond-20 million of CZK [.]
So, you need to change the law.
As president, you do not have such a power d' and only the Senate as a whole may propose legislation.
How are-you solve this problem?
Lorsqu' as a citizen, j' have lobbied for the activities of tourist guide is a liberal profession, j' have prevailed.
The problem is the c' politicking: When a quelqu' sometimes left or right with a good project, celui-ci is purposely and delaying citizens.
As an independent, no party member d' j' have much more likely d' gain the support of all parliamentary parties.
J' have l' advantage of power, without categorization and dogma supporters, take each party this qu' there are best for our country and implement.
You consider as a man left or right?
A D' Czech point of view, have j' l' impression that people rather put me on the left.
For me, a little to the left or right, this n' is not really important.
For me, l' c' is important that we move l' before.
What matters to me, it is not n' that people are left or right but to bring people together.
I always support any solution contributing to the public good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and j' equally act impartially against l' bad ideas.
Est-ce que vous enragez when a quelqu' told you that you are a populist?
But what you said is evidence-advantage?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain goal and a vision.
You try to you.
Some may call it populism, but all proposals I spoke were applied by the world and recognized experts have spoken.
But without the support of Parliament, you can still slogans.
You ’ re here tomorrow not long in politics with it.
Think-you if you will see people and their talk, you will succeed, for example, to impose material responsibility and criminal?
I have not n' d' option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and l' public and try to get them to my camp to impose l'.
If j' was elected president, this would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the Presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on material responsibility and criminal politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Then they should possibly explain why they want n'.
Lorsqu' there will be a strong personality who identify abuse, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example l' election of President by direct suffrage, she was achieved thanks to pressure from l' public opinion.
Confess J' unfailingly be a fan, and not a genius or an intellectual.
J' tries to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I throw myself in politics and I try d' obtain the support of the majority for my programme.
Try J', alone, to make progress, and if it does not work, j' will stop in six years and I will return to the private sector.
C' is a bit as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know qu' one person cannot make a difference, c' is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run the senatorial elections.
Met J' Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
J' have at least supported the journalist Jana Lorencová d' investigation revealed that fraud.
I presented because people are really upset but now j' hesitates.
Sixty percent of people n' have not voted and what l' did have, for the most part, given their voice to a representative of l' establishment.
In the Senate, there are only two independent.
People have elected a Senate could hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example l' the direct election of mayors and prefects regions.
Consider-you to create your own party?
No, not yet, because I n' not have time to check if the past of each member potential is spotless and then I n' have not the financial resources.
I have n' not d' money for my presidential campaign, I have n' twenty thousand on my account "transparent".
You have not n' d' money?
You talk of tax returns, what is yours?
J' estimated about 60 million worth of my personal property.
J' have to Prague a ground d' worth 25 million, an apartment d' a value of 10 million, another apartment 8 million worth, a collection of art works d' d' value d' d' approximately ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb d' a value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
Incidentally, I have an Aston Martin, because c' was a dream of kid: J' have always loved James Bond, travelling by car, was with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a heritage d' worth 60 million and you have not n' d' money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you do not want to invest your money?
This n' is not very convincing.
I have not n' 15 million for this campaign.
I should m' debt?
J' have already invested $2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no n' sponsor shows that my programme does not generate a great interest.
I have not n' l' obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are generally covered by remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I could not live on, e.g. pay l' English school of my son costing 30 thousand per month.
If my sole objective was to earn l' money, I will present in any elections.
You will therefore continue your commercial activities to live?
N'-you had not said that you would your activities in the background?
But this n' is not related to the amount of such remuneration.
As I promised, l' j' have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will spring the direction of l' travel agency.
People want I am a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I of something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to earn between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If j' was president, I would end my commercial activities.
You will find this interview in l' Práva Saturday edition of the newspaper.

The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only d' imagination. For s' suffices to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of books newly built - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it is very futuristic, finally something d' interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a low-traffic on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer in a large company neighbour, said: "Yes, it is fine, this building."
But I wonder why we still need today aujourd' d' a library.
Everyone has an iPad and e-books.
Aujourd', nobody will voluntarily in one of these libraries, elderly?
Spijkenisse, a city that has nothing dormitory-n' d' attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a record quite particular.
The commune of 80,000 souls has the lowest rate education d' des Pays-Bas.
To restore some neurons brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven bridges fictional appearing on tickets d' euros in the form of small reinforced concrete painted miniatures.
The success of l' cultural offensive remained limited.
C' is that the authorities of the city realized qu' n' qu' it was the only way to resume the hand of statistics: Construction d' library!
Winy Maas, d' architects of Rotterdam, MVRDV charts adventurous and creative d' buildings full d' spirit and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual unflappability and ran in the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a sneer on the face.
And while the board members were still puzzled and increasing shoulders, Maas, brash, l' laid them his books of choice in order of size for a pyramid and finished his speech substantiated d' arguments activists by a common: "Dear!"
La voilà, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros d' has sprung.
Building L' s' enshrined in a revitalization project with underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
C' is that this small town dull, who today to jusqu' aujourd' n' had nothing more to offer a postmodern qu' pedestrian zone and a town hall d' a staggering ugliness, whose white façades invite to think qu' harbour a dairy, s' is enriched d' an architectural work.
What is most important is that c' Spijkenisse now has the first building public cultural history.
The long road to reading
First impression: Eldorado Book under bell to cheese.
A lift takes you through the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture l' s' open to you when you stroll through the floor of the building to the discovery of its topography.
Internal L' made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch and the brick floor lamps unequivocally elegant speak the language of municipal squares.
L' urban atmosphere is perfect.
There is already the gaze of benches, dogs and small boys and girls who play the ball.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Normally, library shelves are along the facade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explained Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classic spatial and open spaces of reading l' interior to l' outside.
Inside the mountain L' books has been skillfully arranged: In the middle are the offices, the Internet, the club d' failures, the center for l' environment and the technique of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the annals of the library, which are sometimes panelling, balustrades, sometimes ramps d' stairs.
A new experience for sight, touch and l' smell.
Even the architects and building engineers hardened do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," says Joop Trouborst, head of the project with the municipality of Spijkenisse in a response to the Standard.
Thus C' qu' one day we found in farming ad hoc Frisian waste from l' agriculture.
Aux Pays-Bas, has been used for years of the synthetic membrane d' a millimetre thick d' as substrate in greenhouses and fields.
C' is cheap and l' it saves time.
The thin membrane is used for a season or two, then we can discard.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities in plates d' four centimetres thick.
Under l' heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark material, homogeneous and resistant, odour l' evokes both a new car and sports footwear.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After nearly 500 meters, the literary café offers a view over the city, but also of Dutch nuggets and potted ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but they contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity d' l' mountain air.
Donations for new l' soul
"C' is incredible, but despite all the surfaces of glass, this building is a model project in d' ecology," says Trouborst.
The temperature of l' building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is below d' a belljar, the sun illuminates n' that shortly l' Interior, even the days of good weather.
Thick wooden beams mounted through the glass facade are Persian-sun, intercepting a large part of shelves.
L' ambient atmosphere is very enjoyable.
Fully automated blinds will do the rest.
Stefan Spermon, IT l' septic, s' is already risky to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig also was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, described as "the Boekenberg l' soul finally found" of Spijkenisse.
There are a few weeks when l' inauguration, every citizen has been invited to donate d' a book based on his personal library.
This measure has helped to fill the gaps in the library n' was not yet fully stocked (aujourd' today, it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The shelves overflow from all sides.
For l' architect Winy Maas, "he n' was nothing worse qu' library half empty."
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.

Szabo: "The Germans should play a greater role."
L' Germany chose l' abstention in the vote on l' admission of l' Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert relations between the United States and EU-l' this decision is Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, l' Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of d' Palestinian status d' Observer State of the United Nations.
But it was then chosen l' abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: L' Germany n' not approve what Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin should exercise caution, because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it qu' does not support the US position.
L' Germany wanted to assert its independence, but without being overly critical of Israel.
At l' insurgency in Libya in March 2011, l' Germany had also chosen l' abstention in the vote on the implementation d' a d' exclusion zone.
Finally, l' NATO imposed this measure.
Germany L' feels she-difficulties to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is overhauling its foreign policy, seeking to move s' d' a policy virtually defined by Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of consistent policy and common within Union l' complicates the situation.
The Germans are thus faced on several fronts.
Awaiting them d' qu' they play a more independent role, but they n' are not used.
I believe qu' they are still finding their way to find this role, but are on the way d' a foreign policy more "normal".
A foreign policy, as in France or Great-Britain
That means when the term "normal" foreign policy for the Germans?
It shows the d' will adopt positions beyond those of the United-States and European partners, including as regards national records.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and its relations with certain regions, like Russia, China or the Near-East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other major powers: C' is why l' Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests are-they influenced the position of l' Germany vis-à-vis the conflict in the Middle-East and l' abstained from the UN vote?
Germany has L' first d' d' significant opportunities in the Near-East, especially in the Gulf countries.
C' is why Berlin must be careful not to offend l' public, but also the elites of Arab countries.
He is undoubtedly s' d' a determining factor.
However, I would not be n' too d' importance, because it does not s' relationship exclusively unilateral.
But c' is in any case a determining factor in the German strategic thinking.
Germany L' night-it to its relations with the United States-choosing l' abstention of important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that Europeans and Americans understand perfectly the German position.
C' is why I think the n' divide is not so bad she qu' l' was in the case of Libya.
Even that may be-n' l' Germany should be respected.
Indeed, l' Germany has demonstrated qu' it must be taken seriously as an international actor qu' and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on l' Palestinian initiative are diverse.
By contrast, the United States-announced their veto d' a clear voice.
Opinions differ-they-between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to US domestic politics.
I think l' Obama Administration is secretly evidence d' great understanding of the European position.
But given the political complexion of the country, the government cannot of course not defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences d' opinions are not so great qu' they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice qu' Obama is far from overflow d' l' enthusiasm to the policy of Netanyahu.
She-L' Germany has difficulties in reconciling its close relationship with Israel and the United States-, d' a share, with the position of the major European partners, other d'?
I think it does not make things for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for Germans s' there was a coherent European policy and uniform, but aujourd' n', this is not the case.
They cannot therefore not s' d' register within a broader policy and must assert their unique position.
This C' qu' they are currently in the issue of l' euro.
In my opinion, l' Germany will assume future l' a pioneering role and cause l' Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for n' l' Germany, particularly because relations with Israel.
This question has always been difficult.
But to me, the Germans are well aware qu' they must play a role which marks more independence.
L' Germany is-it play a role d' player on the international scene, l' Germany wants it-play a key role?
Or was she always-difficulties to assume leadership roles?
Germany L' n' is still not used, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to play a greater role.
If l' we look, for example, the crisis of l' euro, qu' whenever l' Germany decides to weigh more, many feelings antiallemands are heard.
It does not make things for the Germans.
In fact, c' is always the same problem: It does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this perspective, l' Germany is in a far worse position that Member-States.
It must contend with neighbours and opinions varied, and this n' is not easy.
, Aujourd' l' influence of United States-on European policy is that decline, but at the moment, l' EU does not fill this vacuum-advantage, then who is?
The Germans should simply play a greater role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant and s' n' that they are less appreciated c' is life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute where academics and experts in politics d' Europe and North America d' jointly analyse the challenges of the transatlantic community.

"Protection of trademarks in China:" When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is s'-it really?
Behind this name is a registered trademark officially in China, but n' has nothing to do with l' company.
The mark has thus d' protection such as l' company that bears the name cannot complain.
And even if it could, he is not sure she qu' n' would succeed.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of the law firm Taylor Wessing specializing in violation of the right of ownership in Far-East.
Each week, a new folder on my desk.
Imitators n' need some extra letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copy legally, as Puma, the manufacturer d' sporting goods.
Pattloch opens a file in which are the registrations with l' trademark office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm has artificially created in s' with part of the name d' Ermenegildo Zegna, the house.
C' is a known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are shopping malls on several floors that sell almost that counterfeits.
Cases of Pattloch are different: His constituents the handle s' attack that l' Chinese Trademark Office formally conferred to Chinese companies the right d' use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai parent," brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan."
C' is with this term that are designated women who marry to wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities say n' have nothing to hide.
"C' is bad for business, we must combat this trend," requires Pattloch.
"The mark is diluted, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation are enormous."
The financial losses and court fees for millions in the sectors concerned, especially as regards the flagship products expensive.
According to the data of society d' market analysis CLSA China represents, with an annual volume of d' 15 billion euros, the third world market of luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, he n' is not easy to cancel registrations dubious of the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
They can last jusqu' to nine years, and after l' n' is never certain.
Pattloch reported trials in which the Court dismissed the complaint, after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a reality "market."
Pattloch explains that if the complainant n' has no chance, it may even be forced to pay money to l' plagiarist, because it would have interfered with its brand in China.
In this area, c' is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases include graphics.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machinery maker Sany, the same company that came to redeem the producer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
C' is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles l' star Mercedes.
Geely, l' acquisiteur Volvo, used before a logo blue and white reminiscent of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to change it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiaires of Hong Kong and Singapore had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are guilty of nothing.
L' trademark office in Beijing CTMO recognizes experiencing difficulties in 2010 because d' a lack of personnel and d' space.
However, l' Office would be spent last year l' d' d' an "emergency situation in the workflow to normality found."
Thus, the number of procedures opposition d' untreated would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type have been closed, which represents an increase of 75% compared to previous year l'.
Nevertheless, 81,500 procedures remain outstanding l' office.
Act expensive
As so often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO L' received more than 1.4 million trade mark applications, almost a third of more qu' in 2010.
According to l' s' d' Office, it is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive year in our leaderboards for the number of new deposits in the world.
This should also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is $5.5 million.
In 2011, l' was recorded 1.8 billion yuan of law d' registration.
In other words, each recording d' reported an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle is much more like l' illustrates the case of l' Freudenberg German family company.
For more than seven years, l' company fights against a plagiarist Chinese.
Admittedly, the Germans were able to obtain the illegal manufacture of vehicle components is suspended.
However, l' imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights on the mark Freudenberg.
"C' is our fault because the surnames cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, president of the direction of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
L' Trademark Office had dismissed l' objection of Munich.
Freudenberg has prevailed with the two bodies, but the opposing party continues to fight to aujourd' jusqu'.
Vigilance is required
, Aujourd' l' case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of judges.
However, he added: "The procedure is long, hard and cost us a lot of time and money d'."
It is also difficult to assess d' internal costs. The archives even had to review the actions of the last hundred years to bring d' evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the dispute.
"This C' qu' you see what it is for us," says Wentzler.
The dangers of l' Far-East threatening to overflow jusqu' in Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region provide s' l' exploitation of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany on behalf of Freudenberg for a company of footwear and leather.
L' company had long since abandoned this sector, but it could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is needed."
Pattloch and advise d' German companies to exercise caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on the international Law of Trademarks, foreigners should "recording in China everything likely d' be protected," said Wentzler.
Otherwise, the costs can be higher than l' registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of his legal drama, l' company should pay licence fees to the opposing party to l' use of its own name, as l' Wentzler explains.
Alternatively, we lose our place on the market segment.

World AIDS Day: Kick, sing, help
The choir Imbongi repeat in Heidelberg, and AIDS orphans of Swaziland welcomed their arrival.
Behold l' history d' a link that crosses more qu' a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First D', typing: Cowboy boots, the trainers, the pumps for women and loafers for men seek the pace by hitting the ground foot. Very quickly, they found.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of singers s' amplify slowly - alto, tenor and soprano - they win, s' bewitch and follow.
Fiete Hopf, Chief d' orchestra of 29 loses almost his canvas shoes when he directs l' orchestra with actions d' flexibility.
We are on Monday evening, the choir Imbongi repeat a new song in the music room l' Institute of Medical Psychology d' Heidelberg.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 came, the geneticist in human medicine to l' man at home.
"Om' Obani n'" is not an easy, every piece has a different words, in a language very exotic: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in parts of Swaziland.
Be helped to help s'
L' UNAIDS, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, believes that 34 million people around the world are infected with the disease.
23.5 million d' them live in southern Africa l'.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans of the village d' Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany through l' association "Voices for Africa".
70 d' them are attending secondary d'.
For 15 or 20 euros per less, you can become a sponsor.
This guarantees l' child l' l' money for school, a school uniform and a hot meal at the centre daily.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller d' stories" or "praise singer."
Nobody can speak the Bantu language in this region, but all can sing.
For almost 10 years, the choir repeat songs in this foreign language qu' she has brought in Germany for now make it to his hometown: Southern l' Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres flight d' bird d' Heidelberg, in the North-West of the Kingdom of Swaziland is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the power of the German Voice Choir.
40% of people with
The village has about 2,000 people, some live in modest or straw huts and most d' them are children.
More than 300 them are orphans, because HIV won their parents.
To Esitjeni, you can see on a smaller scale the ills Swaziland: Rates d' HIV infection l' the highest and lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF l'.
The population n' accepts virtually never male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a proven risk reduction d' infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland carries the virus of l' n' and it is not uncommon to die in the middle 30s.
During a trip d' group in Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis have seen many children on the street he was not only the parental care, but also simply: Food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without n' school degree, he was simply no prospect.
Initially, it was s' that few people who s' personally committed to pay a few euros each year to send a child in school l' and offer him a hot meal per day.
But just a year later, the choir based "Voices for Africa", an association that s' occupies since almost professional AIDS orphans d' Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted infections?
Among the bacterial STIs, syphilis, chlamydiées and gonorrhoea (or gonorrhea).
STDs or HIV, HPV, herpes l' or l' hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to STIs.
What are the groups concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea are often among men who have sex with men d'.
L' Robert Koch-Institute estimates that sexual contact between men are l' origin d' at least four cases of syphilis in five reported in Germany.
Adult heterosexual infections linked to chlamydiées, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), gonorrhea and human papilloma virus are of common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20 per cent of new HIV infections occur within this group.
Among young people, there is a rate d' chlamydiées infections associated with significantly higher than in other population groups.
D' after European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In Germany, the human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is l' evolution in the number d' infections?
He n' is not required to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to l' Robert Koch-Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: The figure rose from 1.967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease d' one tenth compared to previous year l'.
What are the symptoms d' sexual disease?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, pain, urinary losses white, pain in the lower abdomen and l'-onset of buttons and warts.
However, they train regularly n' pain or other symptoms and thus remain hidden.
How to protect themselves?
Condoms can reduce the risk d' infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted through infected Grease or narrow body contact.
Experts recommend to anyone changing often sexual partners of regular breast examinations.
Most STIs can be cured quickly detected and the late sequelae can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds reap the choristers thanks to their voices through l' Germany, s' accumulate.
"Overall, we have already sent approximately 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of l' association.
The village, Zodwa Dlamini, a woman confident and who always gets this qu' she wants, manages l' money from l' Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed in one of their great-mothers for example.
The victims, c' is called qu' older women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some d' them serve jusqu' to 14 orphans, they provide shelter and ensure they qu' commute to l' hour l' school in their uniforms.
L' n' orphan who has no one is allowed in a safe place in Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by l' association, like the two cooks who prepare daily meals for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a school sewing and allowed the construction of two barns. With the help of l' American organization for health PSI, l' association has organized an HIV test for many people.
This is not of itself, because even if the disease is visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," said Annette Lennartz, "because c' is an issue that affects sexuality."
C' is quite curious d', from a country whose king has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of l' black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These mores l' State sanctioned by, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers are also spread the virus across the country.
There are however condoms on every street corner, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost nobody uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh. "
In order to encourage somewhat l' cultural exchange, the choristers d' Imbongi leave together on a trip every two or three years in southern Africa l' and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and d' black identity that many d' inhabitants of the tip of the black continent are still time l' apartheid.
The bus blanks singing in African language is a sign of recognition as qu' it generates not only good humour and joy, but sometimes a tear a formidable-border guards.
The bus takes always Esitjeni, where the choristers visit their godchildren.
Even s' it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of l' Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light", say people là-bas.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometres d' bird flight, back in Heidelberg, before these choristers who tap their feet in the rehearsal hall of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also the light.

Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of l' ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover could reach 20 metres d' thickness.
L' US space agency NASA has proven l' ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains l' frozen water, as l' explain three studies published Thursday in the journal Science "."
The Messenger probe reported evidence of existence l' d' ice cover in the region of the planet permanently plunged into l' shade.
This would cover thickness d' at least 30 centimetres can go jusqu' 20 metres.
Water L' probably comets or asteroids can be-d' who allegedly hit Mercury.
However, nobody makes link between the discovery d' water and l' hypothesis d' a presence of life on the planet, explains the Chief Scientist of the probe Messenger, Sean Solomon.
Temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how l' d' water and other essentials to life arrived in d' other regions of the solar system.

This detail d' an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a portrait of "family" of countless generations d' stars: The oldest stars are in blue and pink, more difficult to identify, are the "new-born" in the birth of d' l' universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where stars are born, named "W5", a name little romantic, in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years.
The NASA Spitzer telescope photographed l' flamboyant d' shine a dying star.

One of the largest photographs and sharper qu' has taken the Hubble telescope is in the galaxy.
According to the colour photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works d' art.
Photography published by l' European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand years d'-light.
The Trifid name comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three of dust divide the heart shiny of birth of stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings d' cosmic accident in the constellation Ophiuchus (the Serpent holder d': 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two galaxies molten l' l' rush to another, the collision is unavoidable.

In this nebulous group d' is the brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle celestial always give birth to new stars.
These clouds d' stars, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also create permanently young stars to 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy to light rays and breakthrough d' a small black hole, it is not yet n' dust, he n' was that gas.
Scientists believe qu' he was born shortly after the bigbang when l' universe consisted largely d' hydrogen.
Our eyes on l' universe: The main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo will use l' a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, mirrors optical telescopes n' have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it was possible to see still further in l' universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory l' near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, l'-United States is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows d' observe l' universe through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The belly of Gran Canarias Great in La Palma, Canary Islands is immense. The mirror alone reached a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
Diameter reached approximately 11 metres.
L' disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is attached to the level of l' vertical angle, which limits mobility.
The hobby-Eberly telescope Texas is also set in l' vertical angle.
The peculiarity of his great ability to collection of light.
Despite a relatively small diameter mirror, this capacity is closer to those of the largest telescopes in the world.
Scientists listen l' universe in search of extra-terrestrial signals to l' assistance of d' Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This instrument has a diameter of 305 metres.
Any person who owns d' a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI," or "search for extra-terrestrial intelligence l'") assigning the computing power of his machine.
View on l' European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), a worthy of the name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can inform the infrared spectrum.
Construction d' a European Very Large Telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the site of l' ESO Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will be available before 2018 at the earliest.
Jusqu' in 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii were regarded as the biggest in the world.
They wore two mirrors d' a diameter of 10 metres each.
The telescopes are part of l' Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea who observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and FTIR l'.
A giant telescope should also be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration allows l' admire.
However, the images of space l' most important we come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since the 24 April 1990, we book images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope is looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 she found qu' 1.235 planets candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST )-will be sent in l' space in earlier d' 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first infrared space telescope mirror of has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope mission will be to find the light reflected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory n' exists because Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
The radar data indicated for decades ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the probe Messenger in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.

Having a child to 136 years
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who was 168 years.
There are, however, no n' d' birth certificate.
And when you think the oldest person documented had 122 years, l' age of Müslümov seems more than questionable.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
L' man was married three times and it would have been 23 children. To l' age of 136 years, he would have designed a girl.
Şirali Müslümov would have-it deceived a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, gerontologist l' Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of l' man in old age d' Central Asia.
"Surprisingly people live in parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," explains, "Scholz in Sardinia, too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible d' establish scientific proof l' because of lack of documents, it was not qu' n' d' civil status registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is that the people of the region of Lerik often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
What is the reason for longevity in the south of the country?
Farid Mugimzadeh tourist guide, the Azeri, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.
By contrast, Fatulayeva, Museum Director, think c' is a question d' diet.
However, it does not seem plausible, d' nutritionally, meals high in calories Talysh, who love the bread and meat, dairy products and many daily drink a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is this-a simple lifestyle that preserves the youth people? To Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With its 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest house of wood, as is typical d' see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the floor beside a d' churn, it beats the content.
Eight people live here under one roof, including a son and a daughter Mirzayeva, which have long been adults.
Two small children enjoy also in the house.
In the kitchen, tea for guests served in glasses armadus typical form of stomach.
White teeth Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf hide of a blond dreadlocks d' dark that her son reveals with pride.
J' have always washed my hair with milk and c' is that I have never lost and qu' they kept their colour.
"I have never used n' shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
The monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten which comes from his own farm: Tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought n' any food in a supermarket.
Then, she describes her husband who was in l' army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But s' is enhanced when the "well-liked" father Heydar Aliyev took orders.
The language of propaganda in the mouth d' an old lady.
However, the cult of the father of the nation, a man who has led his country as a dictator, ne connait almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He has been in power jusqu' in 2003, his son Ilham succeeded him.
What qu' in seniors d' Azerbaijan did not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount qu' euros) for his retirement, a sum which guarantees a good train of life in the region.
And can be the son-long greying of Mirzayeva is right: "Seniors enjoy d' great respect in our culture."
They are the centre of the great family, they loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.

The "Human Rights l'" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival demonstrations show the great divide the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is controversial.
Egyptian President n' is not short on words full d' emotions.
We must succeed the transition.
"And this is my responsibility to the people and to God," said negotiations-television d' State.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also to Copts Christians, the Liberals, Muslim and secular.
Because all members of l' confused and disunited opposition desperately afraid.
They fear d' a theocracy on the Nile to the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost s' condoning, having temporarily restricts the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its "to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world knows what wants to save the engineer 61, a Ph.D. from d' l' American University of Southern California.
The judiciary will be reversed-advantage?
The 234 articles in haste by l' constituent assembly muslim d' 100 people during a tour de force of fifteen hours are disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the decision is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what really means the word "principles"?
C' was and remains a question d' interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague wording and flexibility legal means to implement a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case c' is that suggests a newly introduced article stating that, as regards all topics related to sharia law, al-Azhar University l' must be consulted. L' l' Islamic institution is the largest in the country and lustre radiates throughout the Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor l' legislature, which would de facto the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are open to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts s' tried to stifle opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, jusqu' to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
L' State must also, can-you read in the project, "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote morality and values."
D' a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that the institutions l' State may even control the content of l' art film and literature.
Clearly, it would simply s' censorship.
In addition, no Article expressly guarantees l' equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits d' offend or to defame the prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
By contrast, l' article does not define qu' is an offence or how it must be punished.
Equally questionable is suggesting qu' it is prohibited to '"offend people."
It-enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense d' a law?
Many points are open to interpretation in the project that Morsi submits to the vote which, in his own words, "soon" object l' d' a referendum of the Egyptians.
"Reborn" revolution
L' opposition mobilizes for several weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in an unusual accord in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to topple qu' Sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," launches Hamdin Sabbahi, came third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and ex-head of l' International Atomic Energy Agency l' Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to throw in the dustbin of history l'."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused supporters of Morsi to foment a "coup against democracy."
"S' he proclaims the referendum, to his palace and the reverse," says s' Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers n' is not yet atoned for," said according to the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of l' opposition.
In addition, several judges announced not wanting to monitor the referendum that involve its invalidity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
Meanwhile, the Muslim Brotherhood, well organized, called for a demonstration against-not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but on l' Nile, where a large prayer was organized in l' University of Cairo.
Veiled women and supporters of Salafis, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people are asking for l' application of the law of God."
"Cleans our country!" They asked-to Morsi, asserting that "the Koran [their] Constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic place Thahir, where it all started, quickly created a situation similar to d' a civil war.
Obviously, c' is what Morsi supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood has alleged that opponents of the draft Constitution, as well as his supporters were expressed s' loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot boxes from the direction of the country.
The project Islamists will win the majority.
"The rights of man l' are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this constitutional process imposed should have extend jusqu' in February and encompass all social forces.
This lawyer on Human Rights l' 48 years and president of l' l' Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood lorsqu' they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He l' did not because qu' he shared their world view, but because the l' human rights are indivisible.
C' is why he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even n' delivered once in the new Constitution," regrets-advantage during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
Morsi L' extension of the powers of the three powers discouraged l' lawyer.
These measures are glaring violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the de facto president removes all its powers," deplores Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and trepidation.
This could afford.
A protester in Thahir warns: "You stretching a monster d' qu' you will be more possible control."

The Norwegian s' rakfisk: Is it-fish the strongest scent of the world?
The five million people in Norway d' have one of the highest levels of life, not just in Europe, but also in the world.
The secret of the success of the country could-be linked to appetite l' premises for a fish extremely fragrant?
Take cheeses.
The put-in a pile of clothes d' football wet and dirty.
Wait a week.
And you get l' smell of rakfisk l' disturbing, one of the most popular dishes of Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours d' Oslo.
It snow, the landscape is dramatically - and this smell, ubiquitous, permeates l' air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in l' water during a period - according to l' smell that you want it qu' exhaling — which can go jusqu' to a year.
When l' s' qu' dark and cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here, Fagernes, devoted to this incredible delicacy.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a glass d' aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, local firefighter full time that l' Rakfisk also called "General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Around us, people ingest small pieces of fish and s' dons a large quantity of drink.
"Some people prefer l' aquavit in rakfisk," adds Havard.
The beverage kills l' smell.
J' tries a few pieces.
If you can avoid the pass under your nose, this n' is not bad - this brings to mind a sushi who reportedly spent long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before l' invention of refrigeration, fish was immersed in barriques d' sealed l' air, water and salt in the autumn.
Then, during winter, l' once fermented fish came out and - no doubt with the meaning undermined by l' alcohol - eaten.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their countries to find work, emigrant mainly to Member-States.
Now the population is expanding rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the full employment, the higher salaries and a comprehensive health system.
Swedes, their old rivals including the country was not so long ago n' richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important d', a vital element, well, qu' past of Norway.
This is part of the more expensive.
But everything is expensive - a small pint or a sandwich will cost you 10 €each.
Norway does not often speak d' it in the international news, which n' is not to displease him.
Here, people are unwilling to speak d' Anders Breivik, the racist extreme rightist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
Lorsqu' they evoke the killing, they speak of "l' incident of 22 July."
Norwegians have difficulty accepting that in their country, a peaceful l' could commit such a barbaric act.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, l' one of the largest in the world.
"But oil n' is no single reason for our success," said Anna, our waitress, blond hair and blue eyes d' transfixing, l' image of well-being, with a plateau of rakfisk by hand.
We are - how you say-- people conservative.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we n' not like we do.
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously - all l' exception d' a small percentage d' money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When d' other countries threw l' money through the windows, over the years we have led to the international financial crisis, Norway has kept its purse tightly.
"Until l' you can go skiing in winter and hiking in the summer, we are happy," said Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk-," she adds with a laugh.
I am standing under snow and I am queuing up to buy m' food - j' have had my share of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed d' momentum, a real discovery, c' is excellent.
But tonight, l' smell of fish is everywhere.
L' hotel where I stayed l' is one of the many places that serve l' rakfisk l' for dinner and where you can vote for the best d' them — or may be-for most fragrant d' between them.
There is a TV where the presenter wears a knot-butterfly, surrounded d' rakfisk bases.
Traveling l' Eurovision contest.
"What have you score-provided the best fish in the mountains-Juergen guess?"
"Our points, Havard."
One hears laughter and applause.
A man falls from her chair, could-be l' abuse d' aquavit.
Or may be-c' is due to release fish.

The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
While the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, s' interested in challenges await l' and expectations of the people, who are numerous.
The Traffic in Mexico is particularly bad in l' moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal times, a dam safety has been established since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, l' goal was not n' d' prevent people to go to their work, but d' prevent demonstrators d' achieve Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive l' presidential sash to become the new president at the helm of the nation.
A complicated task l' awaits.
Mexico L' economy is doing well, that l' results to the outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has taken l' commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new strategy security d' that we will achieve this goal.
Before the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of l' State of Mexico.
A highly populated and sprawling gripping the capital. On his land, views on this new leader are divided.
A man direct
In the municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is enshrined in the memory of all.
The attribute the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take a l' new highways M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement was made to these roads, formerly moraines and cracks.
Plates bearing his name to hang outside l' d' a new sports complex and an impressive d' interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to implement sustainable changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the party congress and M Pena Nieto and the PRI.
In terms of security and d' including economy, we hope a real change in our country.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of Congress Olvera admits qu' after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many d' expectations within the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
It rejects criticism from opponents who criticized the new President of lack of charisma.
C' is a complete man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
C' is an excellent man d'-State and, above all, he listens.
However, this is not always n' l' image qu' have people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be clearer.
Hidden beneath the Saint-Nazaire motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier l' year, the military has been called upon to combat drug gangs in neighbourhoods, and violence against women are particularly severe.
In a disaster zone, were found on the edge of discharge, the bodies of dozens of women murdered over the past two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico state l' while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a notorious for the number of innocent women who were killed.
Critics of Mr Peña Nieto, say qu' n' at best, he has failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse the administration of refuse to see the reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this ramshackle, Irinea Buendia struggle to hold his tears lorsqu' she shows me pictures of his deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
The official version reported d' committed suicide by Mariana in 2010.
However, his family think qu' she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived home m', it appeared that his body was washed" chronicles the Señora Buendia.
Signs qu' she had been beaten and rigor mortis was already underway.
While his mother tells l' history, a photo of Mariana dress up the wall beside a cross d' containing the word: Justice.
However, c' is exactly what the family s' is denied.
M' authorities have treated as if j' was an old gossipy, a hero of disorder, a pleurnicheuse.
They want qu' accepted this qu' qu' they say and we remain silent.
"But this is not normal n' qu' there are as d' irregularities and omissions d'-", she said.
When President Pena Nieto will receive his scarf Saturday, she will s' d' a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico in the past six years and the new president has made the promise qu' it would be a priority during his mandate.
"Qu' J' hope it will be as good as president that lorsqu' he was governor," said Olvera, Valle del Bravo, Congressman.
However, c' is exactly what the families of victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.

Bradley Manning did not complain s' mistreatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of mistreatment of Bradley Manning allegedly took place during detention.
The trial focuses on the detention of Manning in a military prison at Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify l' case on the grounds that the kidnapping of Manning s' is made under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier was accused d' stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors have tried to show, Friday, Private Bradley Manning -- accused d' be l' origin of the largest brain d' confidential information of any l' history of l' American army -- has lost many opportunities to complain about the abuse qu' he claims to have suffered in military custody.
In an interview with-d' against Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, the prosecutor, Maj. Ashden Fein said recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine months in detention at Quantico, Virginia, n' revealed no complaint concerning his treatment.
The against-interrogation d' -- during a hearing, Defence has submitted a petition demanding that l' Manning is classified on the basis that sequestration s' is made in very difficult conditions and was a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
This military analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing d' thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks n' has never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At l' hearing Friday, Fein discussed with Manning forms that officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the military prison of Quantico, where he was subjected to a maximum confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers posed questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he reserved his guards was "excellent" and the treatment he had qu' within the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms are state d' no complaints of mistreatment, while officers have l' directly asked about his treatment in prison, Fein said.
Manning replied qu' he had orally expressed concerns about some of the issues and that officers visit had discussed her concerns and qu' s' indicated they would, but they have not n' recorded the issues raised.
"They wrote" no problem "(after raising concerns), and mean, this does not mean that I n' had not caused any problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, Manning has also asked why it was not s' complained about his treatment at d' an interview in January 2011 with the special committee that s' had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts qu' he had expressed by writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to modify its status restrictive indicating a "risk of injury".
The military said qu' they assigned him this status restrictive -- a level below the surveillance for risk of suicide -- for its protection and safety of others.
"I wanted staff know that j' was okay, and I wanted l' I withdraw this status d'... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday on his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before d' be transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered suicide lorsqu' he was in Kuwait and s' have vanished once because of heat.
He added that not having been informed of this qu' was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very scary.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought j' was going to die in the cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said qu' he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes over 23 hours -- without company.
Manning has also added that the only objects were mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothing and his glasses.
He tried to stay in movement, because sleep or lie down for the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also indicated that lorsqu' he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, lit in l' outside his cell.
If the guards did not see her face lorsqu' he turned the night, they would in order to see his face.
Manning L' lawyer filed a formal complaint to the treatment by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked questions to Manning on an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- qu' after being forced to sleep naked in a night in his cell at Quantico, l' forced to stand naked in front of other prisoners and guards d' one morning during l' appeal.
Manning testified qu' at no time, he was only allowed to cover with coverage for l' appeal.
For questions from the judge, Friday, Manning said qu' he had deducted from l' order of his guard qu' it would release its coverage to hide his nakedness, but he acknowledged that nobody had ordered the release.
Manning testified Thursday qu' he had been forced to sleep naked in the previous night, as he tried to prove to an officer qu' he n' was not a danger pour lui-même.
Manning reportedly told l' qu' officer he could use his elastic l' slip or tongs to injury, but he did qu' l' had not done.
This night-là, Manning testified that his under-clothing, tongs, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope qu' at least the judge will consider experiments qu' he experienced during his detention and qu' it will significantly reduce his sentence s' it should be convicted by court martial, a trial which should be held in early d' next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty of offences and fight for l' abandonment d' other charges considered too extreme.
L' hearing should resume this week-end, with prosecutors that should be argued that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was detained in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of prisoners at Quantico.
Heads d' to l' charges against Manning include theft of property or public documents, collusion with l' enemy, giving rise to the publication of information on illegal Internet l', and transmission d' information relating to the national defence.
If all heads d' charges are retained, it faces life imprisonment.

My identity crisis Mexico-U.S.
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack d' opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those parties; they remind Mexicans difficult times, has-advantage said.
Navarrette says the Mexico-U.S. are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico d', arriving in the lobby before customs and immigration d', I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: One for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Aliens").
I stayed motionless for several seconds, not knowing what to queue.
J' grew up in central California, where it l' m' called the "Mexican" all my life.
It is a qualifier s' d' ethnic, in the same way as friends of Boston use lorsqu' they say Irish ", or" friends of New York lorsqu' they say "Italian".
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here was c' Mexico.
And, on the land that has seen my grand-father, no need to qualifier or special line d' union.
J' was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in l' l' one or another language.
But I have not n' vocabulary d' an Aboriginal person, and I cannot lose my accent.
Then j' American took my passport and I headed toward the line "Strangers."
J' have thought about this time-the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has visited President Obama, at the Maison-Blanche.
Generally, when the leaders of both countries meet, their main themes are l' immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto had also want to talk about the growth of l' l' Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than venture Member-States.
He wished to s'-ally of the United States and Canada, and create a Union for trade on the model of l' European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto s' committed to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, he qu' n' did not provide further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States-filled d' is complicated and bitterness.
Most Americans n' have probably never thought about the fact qu' in 1848, Member-States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, from qu' an official U.S. formula the slightest criticism of l' against Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about the way Americans infringe the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And children of Montezuma seek the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult is that with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans living in the United-States.
You want qu' it addresses the subject of bitter l'?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and other d' for whom the country n' not offer them.
The only reason for the large number d' Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, San Antonio, is qu' at one point in our family tree, a person can be-parent or grand-parent, n' found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go in the North.
Most often, this person was a profile -- a brown, poorly educated, from a poor village d', etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently experiencing the American dream, we went to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of that c' is the American dream that we live, and not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We attach to l' Member-States.
Furthermore, we know qu' part of l' Mexican elite among the ruling class doesn ’ t like.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toisent as if we were individuals and not enough to Mexico.
Our Spanish will never be quite good, our ties with Mexico will never be enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous d' failure.
If our families n' had not failed lorsqu' they lived in Mexico, they would never parties.
And we would not stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United-States, but as lost souls.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally in the United States qu'-when she was a child, remember qu' there is friction between Mexicans and the Mexico-Americans, Mexicans are demanding more firmly their identity and the Mexico-Americans are upset.
Well qu' it is American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Furthermore, many Mexico-Americans I know not n' l' impression to join d' a country or other l'.
We love the music of the Mexican group, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are rooted in neither.
In Mexico, we regard as Americans.
And the United-States, we regard as Mexicans.
And now, for a little more complicated the relationship, as I l' have learned during my stay, Mexican leaders and part of l' intelligentsia want to come closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexico-Americans working as qu' ambassadors of fortune to Mexico, representing its interests in the United-States.
We must explain to our fellow Americans that Mexico is a beautiful country qu' absolutely must visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
This n'.
There are too d' bitterness.
And, if considered l' inequalities in pay, corruption and violence related to drugs that are ubiquitous, many d' us are not confident qu' s' d' he is a fantastic country.
You are going to have to fend for themselves, amigos.
C' is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United-States for the way they have dealt Mexico a century and a half ago, they should therefore accept that some Mexico-Americans always want them how family members were treated it n' not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Can be-are-we more "Mexicans" than I thought.

Old quarrels, new Middle-East
The stop-the-fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
-advantage can never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle-East?
Another bloodshed suggests qu' such hope is vain.
While the same arguments futile to know which began, dozens of buildings were pulverized; more than 140 d' Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel-Aviv, the metropolis d' Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their former conflict around d' them, the Middle-East is changing.
The Arab Spring has just shattered, and qu' we like it or not, the Palestinians and the Israelis are overtaken by this upheaval.
Would-be that their fight s' deepen a little more.
Yet, there is every reason to believe that this could help us out of this impasse.
A war which is no loser or winner
At first glance, it seems difficult to demonstrate d' optimism.
Even if the stop-the-fire granted on 21 November continues, the fighting this week have strengthened supporters of force, on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement who heads the Gaza since 2007 targueront d' forcing Israelis to abandon, even if Gaza suffered a beating.
Killing some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million d' l' Gazans in one of the most impoverished and overcrowded planet, Israel n' has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, l' other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their rivals Fatah l' other Palestinian faction, more moderate.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders might say that the time is their ally.
L' influence of Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas s' is rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power booming, formerly l' Muslim ally closest d' Israel, sided with Hamas; like Qatar, l' one of the richest and most dynamic Golf.
Hamas members are growing and say that the Islamist bends around d' Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exerts its domination, through Syria, where the rebels to Islamist trend can reverse Bashar Assad, and jusqu' to Jordan, where allies Hamas threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank d' Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the chairmanship of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and the central Arab countries, has changed l' balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt l' for 30 years to jusqu' fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
In contrast, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders s' l' recover more easily to public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as actor qu' d' importance which cannot be excluded even by Israel and l' America.
Meanwhile, the hardliners d' Israel will reverse the conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been called into box.
The system d' intercept missiles called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep soundly - for some time.
In terms of diplomacy, America l' reiterates its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized the Hamas d' be l' origin of the latest wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has flourished, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, Prime-Minister, which ignored the peace process.
Although the firing of rockets from Gaza killed 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared the suicide attacks, including through the separation barrier that impinge on the West Bank, the piece of what could be a Palestinian state, which protects the Jewish settlements continue to expand s' despite their illegality in terms of international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose party Likud Party merged with a more hawkish Avigdor Lieberman, the leader in l' approach l' election of January 22, has the beautiful.
Why pamper those pesky by giving them a Palestinian state?
S' they ran the West Bank, do they not lanceraient-rockets, as their compatriots l' have done in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind the wall and hit from qu' they leave the head.
Would-be that the hardliners will l'; but it is possible that the Arab Spring.
Although the Islamists, who took power in Egypt and elsewhere have little appreciation Israel, their priority will be to s' address the problems in their own countries.
The defence budget d' Israel is more important than its four Arab neighbours.
Start a war with the local n' superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama for a stop-the-fire which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about l' future.
With the rest of the Arab world who becomes more democratic, deprive Palestinians of their right to selfdetermination l' could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode in the territories occupied by Israel — a little like the bus that exploded in Tel-Aviv this week.
Repression weakens already democracy in l' Jewish state, and demographics exacerbate this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to Hamas have a price diplomatically.
Both sides need d' be driven by those l' outside.
The answer remains as advocated by reasonable people that l' found on each side, and most of the outside world and by this newspaper: Two states, with an assignment of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
Hope, small and short term, is that the stop-the-fire will l' opportunity outsiders to defend this cause.
L' Egypt, who must now s' to stop traffic d' weapons into Gaza, as Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned to persuade Hamas d' accept l' idea d' a Jewish state within the 1967 borders with land swaps and Jerusalem shared.
The Arab countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to qu' they s' unite.
This would contribute more to the establishment d' a Palestinian state that the proposal next to a pseudo d' l' United Nations.
Mr. Obama has also benefit from this qu' Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first term, he n' has not submitted a peace plan of his own.
Back at the Maison-Blanche, it seems equally reluctant to establish one.
C' vision is a very narrow.
The stability of the Middle-East is vital for l' America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Laws for cigarette packages neutral came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos d' diseased organs cover dark green packages that are all the same, whatever the brand
This Act came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and d' horrific photos d' diseased organs and representations d' children and babies whose illnesses were caused by smoking of their parents.
Outside the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the mark, printed in small print on all packages.
He s' is the most stringent in the world d' package of tobacco.
The Australian federal government said that l' objective was to deter youth smoking by deleting any representation glamour.
Studies have shown that if people were not n' started smoking before age l' 26 years, there were 99% chance qu' they never starts.
"Even lorsqu' they are very young children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said the federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek MP, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associated d' crown logo to a princess. "
Although l' Australia recorded the lowest smoking rates in the world and if these changes n' d' have little impact on the profits of multinationals, d' other countries are considering a similar approach.
L' tobacco industry has lobbied against the law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that it would boost trade of black market, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"The consequences of this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters of China and Indonesia d' sell more counterfeit cigarettes into the streets d' Australia.
Other D' stated that this Act boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the request d' cigarette cases, including silicone mask the horrific packaging, has sharply increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain' if Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost before the High Court d' Australia.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting renewal of stock.
For us, the cases are good.
The only trouble, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning ads on TV, sports sponsorship and l' obligation for resellers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia L' banned advertising on the Web by businesses and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites d'.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you do more than d' a small window to promote your products, l' Internet is the place par excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at l' University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed increased contributions from some ordinary citizens in favour of trademarks on social media services like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We must ask ourselves s' s' d' he is an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and s' is bothered to make a video, or is it s' s' d' a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that l' industry focuses on the new regulation rather than on marketing.
Industry L' went to pay jusqu' l' Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries reported to WHO l' that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, of qu' none of these countries was n' d' important trade with l' Australia.
A decision of l' WTO should be taken in the course of l' 2013.
Plibersek MP said the government had held discussions with d' other countries with similar laws on packaging.
Canada was the first country to make mandatory the photos d' warning on packages in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine l'.
Tougher legislation are currently l'-study in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers Australia remain insensitive to these pictures.
The photos do not disturb me.
I do not know.
"You take a cigarette and you put the package," said Victor El Hage when d' buy a package that included a photo of tumour of the mouth.
Frankly, the only reason I will stop, c' is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the centre of Sydney, said that uniformity l' packaging made it difficult stowage of packages on the shelves.
"Before, I had an hour to unload a package, now it takes four hours," said Yu.
"The government had n' qu' to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, c' is good, it stops and the key under the door, "-advantage added, in raising their arms to the sky.

In a world constantly connected, it may be worth s' bore.
J' have spent five hours in an airport during the period of Thanksgiving, because our aircraft had mechanical problems and we had to wait l' arrival d' another plane.
Therefore, j' have had sufficient time to reflect on the theme of l' boredom.
I am not going to lie.
Spend a half-day in an airport to wait a flight is boring, even when you books, magazines and iPhones to distract (without forgetting the shops devoir-free).
But increasingly, some academics and experts in the development of l' child are l' Praises l' boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - s' bore from time to time, say they-.
The brain to paths interesting, even feed creativity.
And as we are, for the most part, constantly before several types d' screens, we know the benefits of l' boredom.
So should we-host l' boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And not.
But j' will return.
All d' l' first, like many people, I thought l' boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this n' is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor d' gréco-story Roman to l' University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Trouble L' deep," said-it.
On the walls of Pompeii include Latin graffiti that evoke l' boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there are the definition we give to l' boredom.
The problem is qu' it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in l' Ontario, Canada.
After numerous publications and subjected l' idea to a discussion group d' about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined l' boredom as an experience that is "to want to do something, but without managing to engage in an activity satisfactory."
What differentiates l' boredom of l' apathy, said-it, c' n' is that the person is not a task qu' d' it would like.
With l' apathy, said-it, not n' l' want to do something.
What is at the heart of l' boredom, has-advantage said, is "c' l' process d' attention, associated with a grumpy and the sense that time passes slowly."
L' boredom may strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if the two can be linked, those who miss s' tend to think that the problem of l' environment or of the world, while depressed persons think the problem is d' them.
Sometimes we may think that we are then qu' s' d' there is a problem of concentration.
In their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have highlighted an experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice d' someone reading a magazine article.
Some groups have heard from the room next door, the sound too high a d' TV which n' was no report, other d' have just heard l' TV, and the third group n' has not heard the Gaza-sound.
Those who have heard the TV to low noise level qu' s' said they were more sensitive than the other two groups - they struggled to concentrate, but did not know why, and attributed the problem of concentration at l' boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult task or, an interruption of l' attention can lead to boredom l', said Mark J. Fenske, an Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and a l' l' authors l' study.
In contrast, when you make a boring, "like watching objects on an assembly line, music can help you do not get bored."
In fact, said-it, now we know that lorsqu' it wiggles or qu' you scribble, these actions, often considered signs d' boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wriggling learn more and retain more d' information that those who are forced to move," said Professor Fenske.
We are all one day or another l' - the delay of my flight d' plane, a speaker with a monotonous voice, a film particularly troublesome.
But some people are more likely to s' bore that d' others.
To measure this, researchers have developed a "scale predisposition to l' boredom" in the 1980s.
Scale L' includes statements like, "Among the tasks that j' performs many d' them are repetitive and monotonous", and "j' have so many centres d' interest that I n' not have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to s' bore more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and have need of many and varied.
But in general, adolescents are quickly blase.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in individual and community development to l' University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported s' l' bore to school and during their homework, while 23 percent reported they bore s' lorsqu' n' l' were not in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents reported s' bore.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether qu' percentages d' d' aujourd' boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added qu' he knew "l' adolescence is a period where l' boredom reached its highest level", particularly because children and adolescents n' have little control over this qu' they want to do.
If I: L' boredom is-it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take risks physical absurd, placing bets or abuse of certain substances to pass the time, as studies have shown.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between l' boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who is studying the problem for more than two decades.
"L' boredom is the way that the brain has found to inform you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain is not always what is most appropriate to do.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, this will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, this will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child s' bored and you give it an iPad, it will s' n' more, but he has learned to occupy s' alone or s' autorégler, says Professor Fenske.
And "this autorèglement passes d' one situation to another," says-.
Your child n' learns not just to entertain, he gets more than control-d' him even in other areas.
I do not think we should glorify l' boredom.
As I do not believe that we should criticise.
Feel at ease l' outside the constant flurry that generate the activities and technology is l' goal towards which we should strive.
Professor Eastwood is d' agreement on this point.
"We need to be bored more often, but l' boredom is an acute desire and frenzied d' be connected to something that makes sense, "-advantage said.
According to him, what people want, c' is a way to disconnect and d' appreciate the time d' judgment.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulés-advantage," said, "it is difficult to find ways to engage in something when noise s' stops."

In Colorado, no directive to the new law on marijuana
Anthony Orozco, 19, a student in a university and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon be legal in his state: Possession of marijuana and pellets d' une pipe used for smoking.
Mr. Orozco said qu' one day in September, he and some friends were aboard a car at d' Lamar, in the middle of fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After l' police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for drug possession and equipment suitable for consumption - minor offences, each s' accompanying d' fined $100 - and a court appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it a-?
During the weeks d' uncertainty that followed the vote of Colorado to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds d' cases involving low use of drugs depends more on the place of the law.
Here and in l' state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving l' marijuana have been discontinued.
Police stopped d' charge of adults aged 21 and minor for possession of marijuana, because the legislation will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors who are in the exchanges more conservative Colorado called to accelerate the affairs of marijuana and continue d' indicted persons who possess.
Meanwhile, several cities in the suburbs of Denver jusqu' to the mountains of western l' vote now to prevent l' opening shops selling marijuana approved by l' State in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so rapidly that I do not know what we reserve l' future," said Daniel J. Oates, the Chief of Police d' Aurora, l' is Denver.
Regulators in Washington State l' also raises a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how d' install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of 31 December 2013.
They say that Colorado, qu' we like it or not, is ahead of most state regulatory on marijuana, first d' concerning l' Therapeutic Use Exemptions and now as regards l' personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, door-floor of Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system recognizes Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
"He n' has no real precedent on which we could build ,-advantage said.
The law of Washington, which s' called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum d' a year, during which the permit system n' will always be, while the possession of marijuana is legal.
Meanwhile, practical issues remain unresolved: How to balance the mandate of l' state guarantees appropriate access to marijuana approved and prohibits l' installation of shops selling cannabis in a 30 km radius around d' a school, a park, d' d' a playground or d' a crèche.
"It will not n' places more difficult than urban areas to install a licensed trade sale of cannabis, particularly in metropolitan Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a door-floor of the Centre for legalisation of cannabis, a research group recently formed.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Oates, Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the public prosecutor) would no longer pursue those 21 and older who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop d' charge people for this type of offence "with immediate effect."
The Chief Oates said that the police would apply the new court decisions that regulate l' activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and qu' it would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, "District Attorney" (Procureur de la République), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to occupy s' business of possession of marijuana, primarily to put pressure on users for renewing qu' detox.
To l' moment, 119 persons were charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many d' between they object l' d' other charges.
"Our office has l' obligation d' prosecute these people who have committed a crime, l' time, was a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas like Mesa County, where voters rejected l' initiative in favour of restricted consumption of marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, is no longer appear d' adults for possession of limited quantities.
The departmental representative public county, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to discontinue all cases of detention of marijuana.
"I have not n' l' impression of wasting my time to continue d' apply the law to this jusqu' qu' it changes, "-advantage said.
Although 55 percent of voters in Colorado have supported the measure, provide a legal framework and government suitable for personal consumption of marijuana n' is not easy.
And contradictory reactions have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"It is a cultural barrier s' d'" with representatives of the public prosecutor, said Sean McAllister, a lawyer in Denver representing persons accused of consumption of marijuana and s' expressed as door-floor room "of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for reform laws on marijuana).
"They spent much of their lives to prosecute people who used marijuana, too, have-it difficult to accept that this is legal, "-advantage said.
As the first states to treat restricted consumption of marijuana at the same level as l' alcohol, Colorado and Washington State l' are becoming a jurisprudence for the legalisation of drugs.
While defenders and representatives of State l' include a new frontier of sales legalized, they expect with concern the directives of the federal government, which designs always sale and marijuana cultivation as federal crimes.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hoped that the Ministry of Justice provides.
Despite some arrests profile of patients under marihuana and sellers, the federal government has enabled shops selling marijuana for medicinal purposes d' exercise in Colorado, Washington and in 16 states.
S' it is true that the police will probably not reinvent the to seize packets of drugs, it is likely it qu' s' against approved shops selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to l' Obama administration.
Many cities of Colorado n' have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Well before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new shops selling marijuana, even s' there are s' d' postponement d' a year.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and should impose the ban next week.
"We do not want to be in a situation where a permit is granted for a quelqu' and then find ourselves in a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather qu' to vote l' State.
Many questions arise.

Petronella Wyatt: J' have been bullied and excluded d' Oxford because j' was a "Tory" (Conservative).
It is not only students who aujourd' d' attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, j' have always dreamed d' enter l' d' Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me a prominent place of knowledge, a Greek amphitheatre d' of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, the freethinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after m' be installed at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, l' j' have decided to make a suitcase, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father has collapsed and s' s' started to cry.
My friends were puzzled.
The Evening Standard newspaper L' argued that j' had left the university because j' had objected that undergraduates have sex in the room next to mine.
Author L' A.N. Wilson said that j' was part after being forced to drink in chipped mugs.
The truth was less funny.
J' have fled.
Yes, j' have fled because j' had been victim d' intimidation and constantly l' bullying.
Not because of my name rather outrageous or because I had d' a private school.
J' have been persecuted for a single reason, and in this cradle of self-knowledge, saying j' have been victim d' racist behaviour and barbaric: My late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential advised Margaret Thatcher and j' was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this aujourd', me-you.
Well, recent studies have revealed a new generation qu' d' students of centre-right suffer the same type of persecution.
Rising hatred and institutionalized students Tory Oxford is such that last week, some d' them demanded protection of their rights, as well as gay, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the students (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College said they were "qu' often isolated, attacked personally and feel unwanted" because of their political opinions.
They want qu' there is a representative within the Committee on l' l' university for equal opportunities so that their views could be presented freely.
Their situation n' has been facilitated by the recent documentary aired on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and Right" ("The Wonderland: Young, partner and Right"), dedicated to politics among students, and which depicted the Tories "" as eccentrics and skinheads.
It found including l' student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)", which uses a Rolls-Royce, complete with a silver and travels with a cane to head.
In d' other universities, students Conservatives say be treated as scapegoats for the implementation of l' increase tuition fees. "
Luke Black, 20 years, vice-president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association," said in a Sunday newspaper "qu' there is a bias left growing in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even we have encountered. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student in history in Corpus Christi, who has proposed a motion for more protection, said qu' such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of l' OUCA qu', said there has been a deterioration of l' attitude of members of the JCR to l' people who are centre-right.
"It constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates and qu' in well-being-members," she said.
J' was the only one in the course of my first weeks at Oxford.
I walked in September 1986, j' was aged 18 and d' a crippling shyness.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
Last year, L' l' university voted refusal d' grant to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - a title, because of the reduction of financing higher education.
L' atmosphere was responsible for Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the week d' home, when the new students acquainted with each other and teachers, j' have had a before-taste of what would happen.
J' have discovered that teachers not only participated in sarcasm to students in qu' Tory, but they were having fun.
C' was as if the policy regarding minors strikers, privatization and opposition l' government l' sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was carved into the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm that j' have been victim was a translation into English l' French texts of the 18th century, and I n' was not prepared.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please bring the first paragraph"
J' have lost.
Pitt, a little man in the face, pustular s' win easily.
"What the is-Thatchéristes refuse d' learn French or are they just stupid-has-advantage?" Asked.
Other students laughed.
Tears were burning eyes.
"I suggest you take French courses for your free time - if you are not too busy n' you make friends "-d' negotiations, has launched a truculent tone.
I returned to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone then j' have felt a slight tap on my shoulder.
C' was a student in second year d' studies d' English, named James, who s' is presented as a member of l' OUCA.
"I know who you are, "-advantage said, gently.
I fear qu' J'.
Anyone suspected d' be a Tory (Conservative) is targeted.
C' is hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, it will be harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be of Labour (Labour).
Later, in the local pub, loosely j' have tried to hide.
J' have insisted that I was not n' d' agreement with everything qu' said Mrs Thatcher.
This scheme has failed.
A student in first year of Philosophy, Political Science and Economic which, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the girl a pig d' fascist."
You are contaminated.
Other students D' resumed the refrain.
J' was perverted, dirty.
"How the Tories are-they l' love?" Asked a l' d' between them.
They hit each other, n' is-this? "
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Would I-only able to lead a normal life at Oxford?
I-have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after nightfall?
I had to would-be Labour and disown my opinions?
The next three years would resemble a purgatory d' d' stigma and isolation.
The only openly Tory was Professor Norman Stone, Professor d' modern history, who taught in my university.
He was hated not only because he was qu' Conservative, but also because it was qu' foreign policy advisor l' Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
It was almost never n'.
He hated the provincial and insignificant, as well as its accession to the point of view of deterministic Marxist-l' history.
In 1997, he accepted a professor at l' Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," has m'-advantage said.
J' started commuting between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refuge with my family and friends urban more open d' spirit.
J' have told my father and I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was in disbelief.
During his studies at Oxford, in the 1940s, all political viewpoints were accepted.
"But c' is the best place in the world," said negotiations had m'-pathetically.
They would not it, not in the city of spires dreamers.
Even my friends communists had ways beyond reproach.
He had tears in their eyes.
Their left-a chance.
I am sure c' is for teasing.
I break the heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent trips to London, my emotional s' resistance is gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a meeting of d' tutorials next week, when another teacher d' story suggested the utmost seriousness, that j' was "an enemy of the people," j' d' have decided.
Internally Rougissant shame, j' have admitted to being a victim of brainwashing of my parents and the traitai of "old crazy."
The respite was brief.
C' is my father who drove the last spike middle Oxfordian my coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I lie in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers have abandoned.
When they left, j' my suitcase and j' have taken the first train for London.
I am n' never returned.
You can treat wimp 51.
But no child under 18 should be victim d' such intimidation in a school.
The tragedy is qu' he was s' d' Oxford, who not only has produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also benefits d' an unshakeable reputation d' equality and freedom of thought.

"Valentino prefers l' elegance to notoriety"
Within the framework of l' exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture", opened this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and d' other celebrity clients of Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, former residence l' d' Elizabeth I d' England, is the only place in the British capital worthy d' host an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer l' acknowledged in l' opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective, which brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"J' love this," said negotiations with his inimitable-Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ d' d' a story whose sole protagonist is "he signore Garavani, who" but n' could be written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the world closed and part of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open jusqu' to 3 March is an impressive number of private letters and photographs signed by cream of l' aristocracy, since Princess Salimah Aga Khan jusqu' to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret d' England.
Valentino exposes memorabilia as trophies from his social mobility: Modest designer of Voghera, north of l' Italy l' idol of the international jet-set.
He n' did nothing wrong in like royalty.
"At least they n' crushing their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpets as some pop stars", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we were both in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We keep all be invited in his chalet in Gstaad," explains l' ex-wife Heini "friend" Thyssen, beauty of time spent as Marrella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred l' elegance to notoriety.
Even so, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, a model Valentino
The Argentine dummy, Valeria Mazza, n' has not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Years ago, after a parade on Place d' Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at her apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment in the decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," remembers the "top model", which began to work with him during the week of haute-couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never pass, because its creations are works d'-art," she concluded.
Parade of noble lineage
The lives of Garavani n' is not a story d' obsessions but d' loves shared.
He loves people well behaved and the more headlines and l' love them too.
A galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a podium glamour of sixty metres wide which proposes d' exchanging roles: The visitor takes the place of dummies and must parading on the podium to admire a "public" dream with the main creations of Valentino, as the tailor qu' chose Jackie Kennedy for her marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool coat and fur that belonged to l' Empress Farah Diba.
Among the models include names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of its clients say that the first Valentino are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember m' perfectly.
It was s' d' trousers, shirt, d' d' lifejackets Gillette "and" d' a jacket of the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It is a gift C' qu' m' had done," said Naty Abascal, one of the Muses of the designer.
"I prefer to all other for her femininity, his great love of women, and he qu' sublime our beauty," adds l' ex-Duchess of Feria.
J' love colours qu' he uses, they are bright and inform the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and modeuse Patricia della Giovampaola d' Arenberg cannot forget, either, the first time qu' she donned a Valentino model.
She was Lorsqu' teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed d' have l' age and l' opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns...
Finally, it was possible in the late 1990s.
J' bought my first model Valentino for a feast in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
C' was an evening dress in red, with a skirt, a strapless draped neckline and a fall.
"C' was a dream come true," said the widow of Rodrigue d' Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless l'," explains l' Italian aristocrat who divides his time between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d' Arenberg retains evening dresses of "designer with the utmost care, because a qu' evening gown n' is not only a dress, she is also l' together memories she qu' vehicle."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of l' exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller scope during her marriage with Paul Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer called the seamstresses) to achieve this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a laggard of four and a half metres.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme specialised press, this dress is a historical fact haute couture of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of clients of high society."
Obnubilé for years by the "know-be" nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy, Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L' Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani d' combines both d' honours that any n' spouses of its clients.
"Sophistication, calm, its treated and perfect m' have always obvious," acknowledges d' Arenberg.
The last time I saw l', c' was a month at a gala dinner d' Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was flawless, the years n' have no effect on him."
If c' is a princess who said...

The hardest of the world: Human Kawah Ijen mules
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by wearing 70 kg of sulphur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is hell and other d' working literally in hell.
C' is the case d' Anto Wijaya, one of 400 minors who earn their living by wearing sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, East l' l' Indonesian island of Java.
It must work each day jusqu' at the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gases from the bowels of the earth solidifies in contact with l' air.
After large rocks of sulphur, weighing a total of almost 70 pounds, he installed in two bamboo baskets qu' it on his shoulders through steep trails.
There are only 250 metres jusqu' at the top of the volcano rises to 8,000 metres altitude d' but exhausted carriers are more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, a turtle, keeping l' balance and measuring their steps not to stumble and fall into the abyss.
They know qu' one misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the volcano Kawah Ijen years ago.
Minors Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents d' euro for every kilogram of sulphur extract.
Once, he fought their way between tourists who photograph them as they were s' circus animals, and painfully heavy baskets, they walk the 3 km jusqu' balance qu' a mining company has installed a bit below to 1,850 metres altitude d'.
It is s' TP Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960, and I can say, its employees, it pays 662 Indonesian rupiah (5 d' euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It sells to 10,000 rupees (83 cents d' euro) l' petrochemical industry since the ore is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks d', cosmetics, dynamite and is even used to launder sugar.
"As we move about 70 kilograms, we earn approximately 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) each trip," explains Anto makes usually three trips per day.
Everyone he takes 3 hours and he finished exhausted, but it saves 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it appears to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, c' is triple that qu' win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," says a holder who worked as a bricklayer on l' tourist island of Bali.
Là-bas, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and work n' was not as difficult, but Anto came close to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for some reason, Indonesia, is also indisputable that sulphur J': "Married a young girl in Bali, where they are Hindus, and I l' have reduced to Java for qu' she converted to Islam l'."
Anto suffers d' asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life to defy the danger on Kawah ljen, but sulphur has already begun to make him pay the invoice well qu' he covers the face with a mask and special gloves.
Anto suffers d' asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases emitted by the volcano.
C' qu' is the price he must pay to pursue his dream.
"I will work even two years because I want to open a shop or study l' promises" Spanish or French-English qu' advantage in a more acceptable.
Ravaged by life, the boy and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptionist in a hotel, but, instead, he made the work d' a mule.
It shares a decayed wood d' dirty with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because sulphur does not emerge at night, when its characteristic blue and yellow becomes shines in the middle of l' darkness.
Defying l' darkness, Anto descends into the crater in s' illuminating with a small lamp attached to his helmet, he qu' s' is bought him-even with his own money.
Some 400 porters load the baskets of sulphur on their shoulders for the bottom of the crater.
Despite its benefits, the mining company has not n' mechanized mining l' sulphur to save costs and provides no equipment holders who work on their own account and are paid in weight.
Moreover, they do not affect a under 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) advance camera, in addition to l' entrance to 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), this natural park wardens charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protest Madrusin, porter, stout 42 years working on Kawah Ijen qu' for 30 years, since he left the college.
Able to carry jusqu' to 110 pounds, it ensures qu' he n' nonstop work as "qu' it can" because it needs to raise money d' 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I die here because the volcano is all my life.
Although sulphur damages throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and trap minors in the thick columns of smoke out of the volcano, they are so hard that nobody complains suffer serious diseases... which add s' obviously their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the shoulders, knees and deformed by weight baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only charge 50 kilograms.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tonnes of sulphur volcano, three trucks carry l' Tamansari warehouse, 18 km from there by a sheep trail invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I die here because the volcano is all my life," says Unainik opening the mouth, showing several missing teeth.
Older L' of her five children, age 30, also works as holder of sulphur.
Time passes, but the misery continues from generation to generation one of the toughest jobs in the world: That the human mules volcano Kawah ljen.

Singapore research babies to save l' economy
Singaporeans shed responsibility for this absence d' children on the career, stress and the cost of l' access to property.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I am a husband and a patriot, thou art my wife and a patriot, fulfil our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come d' an advertisement for mint tablets, but despite this, or may be-through this video s' spread like wildfire on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come d' a rap group that uses local references as "Come to open in the drawer" to mock the birth rate of Singapore.
BBH l' advertising agency to l' origin of the video, hopes to attract l' attention on the problem of fun way through this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said qu' he wanted to use the power of music for people fill "their national duty."
It is intended solely to l' Internet, so we could make it entertaining and fun.
He s' is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, and we felt that c' was a theme that we should address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like launch pheromone fragrances or organize evenings of speed-Executive.
Many of these ideas were n' creative but they have not necessarily work.
We therefore said the following: What more creative to solve this problem that d' a rap song?
1.2 children
The Government of Singapore is not so lightly.
He spends 1,300 US dollars per year in policies to encourage its citizens to have more d' children.
A measure of the government in favour of marriages and fathers gives jusqu' to 15,000 dollars per child, maternity and distributes tax benefits.
But it had little d' effects.
Singapore is a city-state of high technology and South-East Asia l', also known for conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, in accordance with its national distribution of population, currently stood at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he qu' s' is found in top-2, considered the rate of renewal, c' was in 1976.
Why Singaporeans have n'-they no longer d' children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of policies of marriage and the family of the National Population Division, says c' is due to a "better education" and "a wider choice d' career opportunities."
"This has enabled people to have a wider range d' d' d' options in terms of goals and priorities, beyond-marriage and the constitution d'-a family," she says.
These changes have contributed to social standards l' increase the number of singles and delaying marriage and births, which has led to a drop in the birth rate in Singapore.
Between-time d' immigration policy aimed at increasing radically l' immigration to counter the decline of the population has created a resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites who barely disguised xenophobia to l' against the new immigrants, in particular to the Chinese, who are accused of shooting down wages and not integrate s'.
Increase L' l' immigration is also seen as a reason why the party in Singapore last year l' has experienced its worst election results since l' independence.
Since the elections, they tried to rectify the problem with the introduction of quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has known effects on economic growth d' a country, tax revenues, health costs and policies d' immigration, l' example of Singapore also has unintended consequences.
The government is trying to avoid d' construction of many small houses.
For example, it started to touch the estate.
The authorities of urban development began to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoebox", can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square metres and their sale enjoyed great success.
However, the authorities are concerned qu' they can promote a lifestyle of single and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director General of the real estate company EL Developers, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than the largest housing.
They are more popular in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than those of larger.
For this reason, c' is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he acknowledges that the new standards provide clearer guidance to proponents, who was previously a spanner in the works s' they wished to propose too small homes in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-State.
If these new regulations can be a step towards l' increased national birth rate in discussions with Singaporeans who work in the financial district centre, it seems they qu' n' not having much d' effects.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, like education, l' c' is why people until later," says a young framework.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it is important to have my money and my time," says another young d' d' twenty years.
Men and women report their careers, stress and the cost of l' access to property and l' education as the reasons that d' having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens d' having children, when he is s' to babies, Singaporeans them-same who have the last word.

What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of l' Spanish s' Royal Academy, it is the quality of the private sphere or "the area of privacy that we can protect intrusion."
Qu' is-this-be rated for children under 16 years?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
It includes-dangers it s' via the Internet exposes events qu' he did not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, users of the canvas.
In four cases, they have linked the term "something very personal" personal and "the password and user name d' lorsqu' l'" they have applied to social networks.
"I ’ m not going to reveal my more personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years lorsqu' d', he tried to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"These are very secrets secret, my mother may know but not everyone," says-.
On FB, I post images or games.
I also discussed with my friends.
"I do not share one of my photos or a quelqu' that would fool l'-," he said.
The boy recognizes qu' it is wrong to publish obscene photos of naked people, crimes or d' write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures qu' he knows its 35 friends on Facebook and its nine subscribers on Twitter.
The majority of the family.
His mother, in part, she knows the password of a l' accounts.
J' have opened a Twitter account for m' express and write tweets.
"I do not know s' they say, I simply post-," adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can speak with distant relatives or friends, rapidly," said-it.
He says he would never qu' n' demand d' an unknown person.
It will not trust quelqu' who advise him a foreigner.
The case of José, 14, is different.
Teenager L' has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, MySpace and Ask about him, he admitted that he did not know 20 individuals on its list d' friends.
"This does not worry m' because we have something in common, music-for example," says.
According to the boy, nobody has made advances nor asked him his address or telephone number.
"They were S' pressure or l' required, I simply supprimerais my account," acknowledges-it.
José s' subscribes to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Experiments qu' aujourd' known under the name of cyberstalking are not foreign to the boy.
A close friend of mine d' seduce what he thought was a social network.
They threatened l' l' and demanded money.
"He n' ever knew who was" ensures-c'.
The victim, according to José, n' has not closed his account.
"He l' spent only in private profile".
We then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account of safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young posterait photos of knowledge in uncomfortable situations or embarrassing.
Yes, I would do so if j' was angry and upset.
"Even though I know that the c' cyberstalking-," says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, Professor d' English and Licensee in Education and Learning, considers that, for children and adolescents, we must understand that the purpose of the social networks is d' inform.
"The Internet has L' emerges as a means to seek information but with l' appearance of these sites, the rules of the game changed," said-she.
Porras said that l' academician Marc Prensky, who has a Masters in Education at l' Yale University and author of the book "Native and digital immigrants", uses these words to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives, they are children and youth who are born with technology.
"We are digital immigrants must teach them, while we-same currently d' learn", said-she.
He adds that the theme is complex, because "we ask d' have a criterion defined on this qu' whether or not to disclose, publish or say at an age when they n' not have the maturity to do."
"We also call d' be selective so that what matters most is d' be popular, d' have thousands d' friends without thinking about the consequences" she adds-.
According to the expert, the most effective way d' teach confidentiality children and adolescents is d' use issues are sobering.
"Tell them not to do so does not work," said-she.
Then, Porras lists some examples: There are things that you would not be telling a foreigner, why do you-on l' Internet?
Or, you just enjoy it-qu' they publish a photograph of you like d' a friend that you have published?
You-know what other publish on you?
When you see photos, you-applications to other persons permission to identify them?
And everyone-negotiations need to know what you do each moment?
Another point is to make them understand qu' they must act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Beyond l' Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and d' other principles, this must be the same on social networks," said-she.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, Professor d' university, primary school teacher and advisor d' qu' education, says it is essential that parents read conscientiously conditions d' use social networks.
By understanding each terms, they have a solid foundation to discuss with their children implications d' l' opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, l' qu' age and it is allowed to share or publish", said-it.
According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind children qu' we must not talk to strangers.

The summit of the Unasur l' s' is complete without the Lima Declaration is made public
The sixth presidential summit l'-Union of South American Nations (Unasur) s' aujourd' is completed in Peru without the Lima Declaration was made public, even qu' she was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the 7 representatives present.
Efe tried repeatedly d' access the document signed at the sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government d' l' Unasur, but the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported initially qu' it would be disclosed after the close of the summit, then said it would be qu' d' a moment to l' published on the website of the Peruvian government.
Lorsqu' they were questioned on the text, they reported that its contents had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala during brief statements to the press.
L' journalists access to information about the summit was constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of l' presidential assembly with the message "closed session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little d' information circulating between the journalists were those given by the press officers of some l' Unasur governments attending the go-you, l' exception of door-floor of Peru.
Unique L' document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which has caused unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more information.
Later, the President of Peru has sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the s' President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru has been l' 3rd summit host South America-Arab Country (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this has been urged by the press, he had not n' issued the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as had been previously announced.
On the official website of l' ASPA, we can ensure that the document was published in March.
In both go international-you, the Peruvian authorities tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they have limited to obtain maximum l' d' information.

"Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts," said President Piñera giving a handshake to President Humala, beside the flags of the two countries.
Confirmation of the two Presidents qu' they submit to the ICJ held after Colombia has denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá by which it had agreed to comply with the decisions of the international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua qu' she considered seriously flawed.
The summit is held s' without the presence of Presidents of Brazil, Rouseff ’ s, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales of Bolivia, and l' Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay suspended from l' Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of his ex-President Fernando Lugo, n' has not participated in the go-you.
Host, President Ollanta Humala, has been appointed d' open deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The agent has read the outcome document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action d' 31 projects had been established between the South-American for a total of $17 million d' investment.
Among the agreements, he said that the countries of l' Unasur would put in place of "important steps to achieve the goal of citizenship South-American d' development agreements on the residence permit."
He informed that measures would be implemented to improve the "cooperation in combating l' insecurity and against international organized crime, actions for a better access to medicines, l' access to Internet l' cheaply in the entire l' South America, and to assess jointly and effective natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation of l' (Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix to help increase our productive and matrix to envision a better future for our peoples," concluded President Humala.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that improve the connection l' spaces of South America, particularly in rural and border areas... by pooling our countries and generating new economic channels," said the Peruvian President during a speech d'.
Among these projects, he said that five were Peru and were on the crosscutting of its territory, since the coast jusqu' in Brazil, and two for a more important with l' Ecuador well n' qu' he has not given details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will reinstatement within l' Union of South American Nations-", which he is currently excluded.
The need for l' Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before you start the go-regional qu' he hoped to meet with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday at Mexico City to discuss calmly of maritime dispute through a d' ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), j' have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We will revise all these pathways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which will require d' having a discussion with this country, "-advantage said.
"J' hopes to say to President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful manner possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico where they have planned d' attend the takeover of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.

"L' South America must learn how to integrate l' Europe citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador, l', said that the establishment d' aujourd' common citizenship is a goal for which "l' South America, in this case, should follow the example of l' Europe."
President Correa, who participated in the sixth Summit of l'-Union of South American Nations (Unasur), Lima, told television d' State TV Peru, that Europeans "s' were killing each other during the Second World War and" d' other conflicts, "but they were qu' now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project d' establish a citizenship South American-backed by those countries members of l' Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any country n' southern US-c', as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas reactionary that we want to belong to the past "-advantage has warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President s' is shown in the reconstitution of l' Organization of American States (OAS) with l' objective to reduce l' influence of States Anglo-Saxons and take into account the signatories of the Pact of San José on Human Rights l'.
Those who bombarded us is never compromise, l' opposite, we, the South-American, l' have all signed.
"It is incomprehensible that the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights l' lies in Washington under the funding of United States-has-advantage," said, alluding to l' political asylum granted by l' Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa ensures qu' he does not regret her decision, because it has not even n'-betrayed its principles, but instead has met its "deep democratic values and rights of l' man."
He concluded qu' to l' time, "there was suspicion that Assange should be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticises justice demanded qu' Swedish comply on its territory for questioning on a sexual offence alleged while "the Swedish legislation can do this by videoconference, which could be done since l' l' Embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa said qu' there was a risk that the mental and physical health d' Assange deteriorates.
"I have not spoken to him since qu' it lies in our embassy, but l' ambassador m' informed qu' he had a small lung condition, but nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.
It is possible that his physical and mental health is deteriorating by the fact d' be confined in a small space without make d' exercises to l' open air.
"It affects the health of n' anyone," concludes-it.
Correa noted that the solution d' asylum granted to Assange since June in l' Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be l' allocation d' a except-led that would allow her to visit Ecuador, lies in the hands of Grande-Bretagne, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he stressed qu' he had discussions in London to find a solution to l' confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with the Human Rights l' n', we use this word in this case, but there has been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Grande-Bretagne, Sweden and European judicial authorities because l' lawyer d' Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings from different European bodies, "-advantage said.
And he thinks that "if the Grande-Bretagne the except-led tomorrow, it would end".
And if Sweden, as is quite its legislation, as it has done in l' d' other cases, asked Mr Assange in l' d' Ecuador Embassy in London, or l' asked via Skype tomorrow, the problem would be solved.
Correa has the opportunity to reassert themselves as a defender of freedom of the press and he noted that this qu' there was "not tolerate mediocrity, bad faith and lies that hinder freedom d' expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians but malicious or perverse bad journalists in the pay of l' greed, blackmail and extortion l'-advantage," said.
From this perspective, it s' welcomed this is not the kind of journalists "or the bankers and the hegemonic countries and bourgeois who dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his reelection, "it deepen the revolution to pursue the road and track".
Correa has also supported the decision to maintain the ban on Paraguay within l' Unasur at least jusqu' in the upcoming elections, arguing that l' body "should be firm and not tolerate l' opportunism and attempts to blow d' State disguised", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, President of Ecuador considers "relevant" the desire to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
For the moment, the judgement n' is not respected.
C' is a problem between a South-American and a Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overtaken by the d' will move forward together.
We must solve them together to overcome them and move l' before.
At the same time, he s' is confident in the resolution of the dispute concerning the maritime boundaries between Peru and Chile in the same court and he said it is "qu' beneficial as l' Latin America seize international forums if the two countries s' agreed to accept a judgment if farm qu' it is."

Correa has ensured that he lost s' primary in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At a personal level, power m' has never interested, but in situations as unfair than l' Ecuador, poverty-more economic cannot be solved only through the political power.
"My political movement believed c' was me guaranteeing this potential victory but we must accept this responsibility, "-advantage said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from politics.
If we lose, I will also.
"C' is my decision, "-advantage said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.

Deaths due to AIDS are now aujourd' due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old lorsqu' he confirmed the result of the test: Infected.
"C' is as if the sky m' fell on the head," said-it by referring to the time of l' announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less onerous", in vain.
The young man l' hid his family.
He decided to take one of his illness and began s' inform about him and his determination has been such qu' he recently celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is, without doubt, one of the oldest patients l' unit of HIV l' civilian hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which he s' is found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio l' living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigmas.
Then, the clinic director d' l' IMSS avoided to say goodbye qu' "because he was speechless."
In this time-there, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Aujourd' today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and d' have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people are still when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims d' opportunistic infections.
31 years after l' appearance of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory that survival is aujourd' d' a patient started treatment with timely and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of unit l' HIV HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and it takes to reference that this information has been validated in April this year in a scientific publication.
L' infectiologue and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS n' was more a deadly disease, but that the number d' years of survival and quality of life depended on the level assignment d' immune system of patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those zero drugs: Jusqu' 30 years for a CD4 count of 200 and jusqu' 50 years for those reaching a rate of 500 CD4.
Put simply, this means that for a quelqu' receiving a diagnosis HIV positive for 25 years, "both qu' it will remain under control, can live without problems jusqu' 75 years," explained the scientist interrogated.
To put this in context, it is important to know that l' life expectancy of Mexican is now aujourd' 76 years on average.
It is true that S' mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of deaths from AIDS increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011, according to the annual report d' UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since l' appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients reported on the national database died.
Nothing qu' in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 dead jusqu' in May this year; however, we are assured that l' access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why do-it-wording of death?
I think the problem is not l' access to treatment.
C' is as I see it, c' s' is what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we n' have never missed medicines, the problem is that patients arrive at a very advanced stage qu' because they do not know they are infected, or they l' learn to advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine patients on ten came qu' they already have an opportunistic infection, this qu' it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality, c' is earlier diagnosis, and this must propose testing, to anyone who requests it."
Specialists and Council members d' State AIDS prevention of Jalisco (s' Coesida) on its proposal, as well as patients them-same as Fabrizio, who has done its testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend qu' l' did and that, despite his age, he was already holder of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is a common l' complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some believe qu' they will die and do not want to know.
"If I die, it is better than I m' erupted three times a week," say they-n', this is not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I am l' exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents know only qu' he suffers d' cancer.
J' have a normal life, as anyone d' n'.
"I work, j' have much d' activities, I travel, j' have sexually active, but responsibility, I pay attention to me and l' person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with JALISCO ARE GROWING. To help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid, aujourd' during the march of the World Day against AIDS.
Qu' they make the test s' they took risks, the more they will soon s' they are HIV positive and better, and they have already s' diagnosis requires l' qu' they know that we can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, supports Ricardo Salazar, Guadalajara journalist who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest lies in prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "it has increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we have packages of 100, c' is very well, but as a result, qu' aujourd' n' even today, some have no access to condoms," says-.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "Is Qu'-what you do?", with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors d', pharmacists and other health professionals, is the question that adolescents are unwilling n' d' hear, the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this distribution ineffective; that condoms are not only sold, but qu' counters are located in distributors public washrooms and in the places where young people.
It is not s' d' encourage promiscuity.
It is s' no pay girls and the motel, as had told the governor Emilio Gonzalez lorsqu' he had asked s' there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"This is not as n' works sexuality, it is best to provide condoms to those already sexually active-advantage," said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 Cumulative (12,158 1,317 AIDS and HIV).
L' State is the 4th State of countries in number of new cases and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for the number of HIV.
92% of infections are sexually transmitted by blood transfusion, 6% and 2% perinatally.
An estimated 50,000 people living with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore l'.

A judgment ratified on appeal by a court of United States-ignores debt restructuring of the group Vitro provided via a bankrupt business in Mexico. The scenario is a harmful precedent for all national societies with ramifications in the neighbouring countries and solvency problems.
It seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country to the Stars and Stripes, opposite view of international agreements.
D' a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment of 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the embargo d' beyond-their properties in the Bravo.
However, the resolution is the leading manufacturer of glass of Mexico to the Supreme Court of the United States-based on three inconsistencies.
First D', while the judge of the case said that Creditors s' register according to the Bankruptcy Law-United States, the court d' appeal for the Fifth Circuit, sitting at the Nouvelle-Orléans, contends that the main proceeding is the commercial bankruptcy formalized in Mexico.
The first point would denounce the cooperation of international procedure in cases d' insolvency d' companies with a profile transnational.
In fact, the United Nations Model for l' Consistency of International Commercial Law had been established for this purpose by taking l' American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgement stated that without the intercorporate vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by subsidiaries of Vitro to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring n' l' could not be obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
Indeed, the case of Vitro n' is not the first to use this plan.
Here there is a half-dozen d' examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, including l' Federal Institute of Bankruptcy Commerciales had guaranteed debts.
In addition, what is certain is that puisqu' votes remained subsidiaries, all the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, c'-is-including as "vulture funds" Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, n' had not obtained the majority.
The vote was 45 votes to 37.
A given omitted by the court d' appeal.
D' another side, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation qu' he met since 2008 without s' stop to the serious economic crisis faced qu' Member-States, passing the costs to the country.
For now, the company l' family González Sada file an appeal before the same court d' appeal for the vote in its entirety, c' is to say with the five judges, as only three had voted.
Recourse d' insurance claim the not-prosperity and requires the revision of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United-States.
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of l' amicus curiae ("friend of the court") in which detail the procedure followed by Vitro within the framework of the law on business bankruptcies, noting that the freed conventions signed by both countries for the set at the same level as l' paragraph 15 of the Bankruptcy Law Member-States.
Furthermore, he pointed out that the country is s' complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, c' is-including the rules for transborder d' insolvency cases, which guarantee l' equity for debtors and creditors.
Pileup of two parts: They overwhelm Vitro and they overwhelm the country.
Overall assessment
Complaints of trade unions of the Mexican Society d' Aviation to l' against l' ex-boss of society, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been ignored for several months, celui-ci was accused d' administration fraudulent l' Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviators has already encountered problems.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball-Ball is my entire life"
The globe-basketball-owned Ball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, through him, has travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of l' history of basketball-Ball as large as the local d' Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is qu' before qu' cerebral hemorrhage did condemn the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a player, league player l' national team basketball, manager and leader of l' national team, the NSO, with Vaqueros of Bayamón or as chairman of the federation of basketball-Ball.
"J' have brought several hats in basketball-Ball throughout my life, and even many simultaneously, as when j' was chairman of the NSO, Director General of l' national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit to d' Primera Hora home to Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball-Ball is all my life."
Reyes n' not exaggerate when he made this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his itinerary, evidenced by.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those qu' he favours the most are those who remind her of her passage as player within l' vaqueros team in the mid 1950s jusqu' in 1982, after 15 years as a co-manager or l' team manager.
"This was my best years, those who have benefited most from j' because j' have had the chance to participate in eight championships vaqueros from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
It is many years d' satisfaction, including the five disputed championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then removed during the championship in 1981, when l' Jerome Mincy entered l' OBS team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great director, took the helm of l' team, "said Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who was here and leader who was at l' University d' Alabama (Birmingham), m' said: "J' have a hefty player for you, two metres.
You want? "
C' is as qu' starting Mincy, one of the best players qu' was Puerto Rico.
Bartow m' then recommended Raymond Gausse, who had been naturalized and who was a better marksmen.
I remember qu' he said that if Mincy had enabled Bayamon to win a championship Gausse would help us try d' in win another.
He is pleased s' championship with Gausse vaqueros, but only remotely puisqu' in 1988 he was already the czar of the federation.
In this time-there, he preferred to take advantage of its charges and Mincy in l' national team.
I remember when we l' have won for the first time to United States-pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the Mondial de 1990, where we arrived 4th and where we would have to win the bronze medal Canadian judge if we had not play the last game, said Reyes.
Team L' Mondial de 1990 is-it the best national team that you view?
It is part of the best, like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favourite is the Pan American Games of Cuba in 1991, when we won l' gold and we have taken a beating in l'-United States team, which was quite similar to those who won bronze at the Mondial.
This team n' was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also youth (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote n'" Morales, who had been unable to attend the Global 90 because d' a knee problem.
A team that can be-n' was not the best in terms d' individuals, but it gave us a medal d' gold and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in lieu of players suspended by l' imbroglio Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we won gold l' against all predictions.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
Undoubtedly, it is s' Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at international tournaments are impressive.
Person to Puerto Rico n' dominated at this level as l' made Piculín.
And this without taking into account its trajectory in different leagues for which he played.
That was the best Puerto Rican leader?
C' is very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In the young, j' love the work of Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest achievement within the federation?
Having part of l' time the most glorious of l' national team between 1988 and 1995, and qu' in the early 1990s, the NSO had jusqu' 17 teams in a season.
You rest-advantage to do?
There are things that j' wanted to implement, like the regionalization of minor categories.
For example that boys Ponce play only in their area and only teams other corners of l' island in the play-offs.
The Aujourd' travelling and play too while this n' is not necessarily required.
J' have at least seen l' advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, the field staff and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What do you aujourd'-?
In general, j' listen to music, I watch my clips on YouTube, I take my small-children and, from time to time, j' attended games of basketball-Ball.
And of course, I take the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been at my side.

Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931, Forth Worth, Texas, s' is worldwide known for the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he embodied a man d' business unscrupulous daunting and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of l' greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night complications d' cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The associated Press for Warner Bros., production of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the role ironic qu' he loved the most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his friends were with him in Dallas in this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman lorsqu' he died at a hospital in Dallas, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
It was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and we will greatly miss.
"C' was a person d' exception and he lived life to bottom," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed hepatic cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and he had admitted much drink for many years.
In 1995, she had detected a malignancy and he had undergone liver transplantation.
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman s' was known to television in the role d' an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of my dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
One-in, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed lorsqu' he discovered a genius attractive, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and qu' it back home.

Among his film credits include roles well received by criticism in "The group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was through his masterful interpretation of deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives has been disseminated d' April 1978 in May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", invented to maintain suspense around d' an episode full d' emotions in which the character d' Hagman is almost assassinated, generated speculation in the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, inter alia, the series has reached a record d' hearing at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average before their screen and have made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment programme in the world, after l' final episode of "MASH" in 1983, who had gathered 50 million viewers.
C' was the beautiful sister-J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who was shot.
J.R. l' was pregnant and had l' then threatened with l' accused of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but d' others had also reasons of l' attack.
Hagman played Ewing as a man role d' corrupt and insatiable but charismatic smile: A contractor dishonest and an unfaithful husband who tried to place his wife alcoholic Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know this should be qu' as epitaph for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
We should write: "Ci-lies l' honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This unique l' part qu' he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagoniste from the original series, s' recalled this Friday d' d' Hagman as a "huge, both on the small screen as in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable for millions of fans around the world and in the heart of each d' us, who have had the chance to know and love l'.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were released a few months with great success on TNT.
L' recording of five episodes is already finished for the second season and a sixth is in progress, informed the chain.
For l' moment, nor the Warner nor the chain TNT n' provided on how the death d' Hagman will be integrated in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of l' actress and singer Mary Martin, who met fame with such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager lorsqu' she gave him the day in 1931 when qu' she was married to l' lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of New York in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
C' is low-qu' he met the young Swedish interior decorator d' Maj Axelsson and he qu' l' married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Submissions unforgiving of J.R)

A course on the "end of the world" is to begin
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes as nuclear war, the cyber viruses and germs and global warming.
This semester, when Professor religion Stuart charmed decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he was a hook qu' irresistible: The end of the "countdown" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, which many people refer to as proof of the impending doom.
But Professor charmed n' had no idea what l' expected during the months: L' catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a chasm that some have dubbed "Armageddon" l' debt and growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists to the end of time thought occurs l' apocalypse.
"I did not realize that it would be half the more apocalyptic n' that I have ever seen," said this week Professor charmed her students University l' Rutgers-Camden, New Jersey.
If you look at what happened in the world s' aujourd' as if we were 30 days later and the already, this was a very good time.
And it should be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in l' apocalypse.
And he is not the only n' professor to give lectures on "the end of the world" this semester, who will, in theory, the last of l' history.
Temple, the Assistant Professor Barry Vacker provides the "Media, Culture and end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes as nuclear war, the cyber viruses and germs and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferated over time," said-advantage, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios guide some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons l' fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could erupt.
This month ,-students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and consider how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"J' have tried d' inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania State d' ', Professor d' History d' Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an Assistant Professor of Art and History d' l' d' Anthropology, have teamed up to provide a course, simply titled "The end of the world".
"We add" 2012 "to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world does not would disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "disaster", students must study, create projects and spend their final examinations.
In l' State of Pennsylvania, l' final review will be spent on the eve of l' Apocalypse, which does not leave students d' choice but to work "jusqu' on the night of the supposed end of the world," said Restall.
Courses have proved quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for students, composed of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the start of the semester, from persons requesting s' there was still the place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting l'.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do for comfort," said Bridgid Robinson, a student in religion and Sociology of 23 years, from Haddonfield, New Jersey, l' University of Rutgers-Camden.
Because the fear of l' Apocalypse, qu' it is secular and religious, is only a question of comfort, or d' lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student of psychology and 25 years, says previewing all films.
"I had never heard n' d' a course which taught the has-advantage," said.
I appreciate l'.
But no students surveyed, let alone a teacher, we believed in the end date of the world of 21 December.
"Our first project addressed the Mayan prophecy, and d' a way we l' have discredited," says Julie student zegle last year at Temple, aged 21, from West Chester.
The Maya n' have never predicted the end of the world, it is only s' d' a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I admit there are qu' anxiety related to l' apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, which makes people respond to changes in their environment in predicting the end of the world.
Internet L' has led to a boom in speculation.
"In d' other places, people don ’ t think about this, "-.
He s' majority in the Anglophone world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of l' University La Salle who lectured the Philippines this year, responded quickly lorsqu' asked s' he knew qu' here given courses on the "end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world", we-it-wording replied, as he s' s' d' d' was an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace of the Pope.
Restall noted qu' over the years, we talked about the many supposedly dates of Judgement, and he says that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosophise about the fact that on 21 December marks the beginning d' a period of 7 years at the end of the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Several told us they thought qu' go to parties "the end of the world".
"Sometimes j' called friends and we reached together," said Samira Ford, Communication student of 20 years.
